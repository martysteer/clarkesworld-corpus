Home was vast stretches of warm ocean currents with schools beneath, and colonies.\n Home was a laboratory where all the concerns were popular. The Crown of Thorns invasion, their numbers out of control and crowding out the reef systems, the unending march of predation turning an ecology to wasteland, and that ecology already vulnerable.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d Apocalypse had left a dozen scientists stranded on a reef laboratory\u2014stranded by choice more than compulsion, because there were boats available, research vessels that could have taken them to the mainland if there had been anything left to go back to. The lab was at least familiar, with the advantage of solar power and fishing equipment. No one would go hungry, but for people defined by their intelligence, by the career choice of science and of conservation, there was more than physical hunger to satisfy.\n \u201cWe\u2019re outnumbered,\u201d said Mel. \u201cAnd anyway, there\u2019s no one left to report to.\u201d There\u2019d been nothing but silence from the university for months, and silence in the new world, the world defined by plague and absence, could only mean one thing. \u201cIt was only a pilot program anyway.\u201d The desperate attempt to clear and monitor a small patch of ocean, to see if intervention could lead to recovery. Diving again and again, in clear warm water with spikes beneath, with stars, and so focused on seabeds and the possibility of resurrection that the other destruction taking place had seemed a distant thing, unnoticed at first, or at least not taken seriously until the silence began to spread, to became too monstrous to be ignored.\n \u201cThey\u2019re just going to keep coming.\u201d He\u2019d thought it a horror, right from the first. They couldn\u2019t even move that fast, those bloody starfish, but there were so many of them, and they just kept coming. Inexorable. Appetite in symmetry, and better at breeding than anything they wanted to eat\u2014which was most of what they could get their arms around. Most people who visited the reef thought of appetite in terms of sharks, of the collision of teeth and flesh from below, hunger rising from the depths to breach and tear. They never saw it spreading like a desert over the ocean floor, destruction from a hundred thousand tiny mouths and more.\n \u201cAndrew.\u201d Mel in front of him, moving with his eyeline so that he had to look at her. He\u2019d close his eyes but it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. She\u2019d still be there, and their daughter, made in her mother\u2019s image, would still be gone. \u201cAndrew. We can\u2019t go on like this.\u201d\n It had been a blessing at first, the ability to carry on. There was something vocational in it, the necessity of purpose. Apocalypse had come but their remit remained: conservation. Preservation, though who there was to preserve the reef for now was debatable. \u201cFor all we know there\u2019s no one left but us!\u201d But the alternative was sitting round the giant scarred table in the shared kitchen, sinking into their own separate silences, a dozen of them, and rudderless. It had been shared instinct that kept them all going, the science something to put their backs against. Something to cling to, something that still made sense.\n He should have known that small mercy could never have lasted.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for us,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not doing it for fucking anyone, mate,\u201d said Trevor. He was the youngest of them all, his idealism turned sooner to salt than the rest. \u201cThere\u2019s no one bloody left, except for the Kiwis.\u201d And that was the crux of the matter. A little island alone, and they could pretend that what they did had value, that there was purpose in the continuation of the work, some sense of dignity that, as a community, they hadn\u2019t fallen apart. The mythology of Australian apocalypse said that they should have done; said that there should be conflict and factions, the wide expanse of horizon illuminated by dust instead of ocean. There was pride in acting otherwise, a sense of culture and structure come from science and self-respect and the refusal to look closely at the monstrous abandonment of apocalypse.\n It was a refusal that had served them well, for the most part, until the signals began to come through, the sign of societal remnants other than theirs. Isolated groups, coming together on a southern peninsula and they were scientists too\u2014a scattered population of fieldworkers quarantined by vocation and saved thereby.\n The knowledge that others existed had torn the thin pretense of their own survival apart. Stay or go was a choice that held little difficulty when \u201cgo\u201d meant a life alone, a continent full of bodies the only escape from a reef built of coral and corpses, the remains of ocean-dwelling fragments more attractive than anything they could find ashore. But when \u201cgo\u201d was a viable option, when it held the possibility of a community capable of more than eking out the last few decades of life, the debate had become more complex.\n \u201cWhy can\u2019t they come here? I know they\u2019re the bigger group, but surely a base is better here.\u201d In the warmth, where food grew easily and fish was easy to come by.\n \u201cOtago\u2019s not Antarctica, Andy,\u201d said Mel. It was colder than the reef but still easily arable, still well able to support a population much larger than theirs.\n \u201cI knew a girl when I was in Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cCome across the ditch for an internship. She practically stripped her own bed every night before climbing into it looking for snakes, spiders, all that shit. In the middle of the bloody city! I tried to tell her she was over-reacting . . . \u201d but she\u2019d come from a country much kinder in its ecology, less toxic, less lethal, and she wasn\u2019t much interested in being persuaded. \u201cShe did a lot of tramping. Said she liked the fact that at home she could go for a walk in the bush and the only thing to kill her would be her own stupidity.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s as much stupidity in exaggerating danger as there is in ignoring it,\u201d he said. There were sharks on the reef, he\u2019d seen them, and some were big enough to kill him if they wanted to. He\u2019d swum with them\u2014not without a certain amount of wariness, and never at the dangerous times of sunrise, or sunset\u2014but if he\u2019d let the idea of sharks take him over then he\u2019d never have dived at all.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not going to leave their home just so that we don\u2019t have to leave ours.\u201d\n It was a mistake they\u2019d made before. A mistake that had kept them all alive\u2014if it was life, subsisting on the fringe of a collapsing ecosystem and cut off from the past by apocalypse.\n That apocalypse had happened so quickly; the plague a bright and burning thing. It consumed the population, chewing through flesh and blood and bone and the rate of infection was so immense, the mortality so complete.\n Andrew dreamed of his daughter, eaten up by fever, made dull and lank, crumbling under infection, the colonization of bad bacteria. In his dreams he couldn\u2019t touch her. In his dreams she was eaten by starfish, covered with Crowns of Thorns, and silent under the spiny blanket of them until nothing was left but skeleton. In his dreams she never even screamed.\n He was the one who screamed, waking in a bed heavy with sweat, beside a wife who had put sleep behind her because she could no longer stand what sleeping brought her.\n \u201cDo you think we should have gone to her?\u201d he said, the covers thrown off them both and the sound of water lapping beneath windows.\n \u201cCivil Defense said if you\u2019re not infected, stay quarantined,\u201d said Mel. It was an old argument. They\u2019d both been skeptical; and the transmissions now were automatic, mechanical repetition over channels.\n \u201cIf we go to the mainland we\u2019ll die,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWe can\u2019t help her if we\u2019re dead. If she\u2019s alive she\u2019ll come to us. It\u2019s safer here anyway. She\u2019s a smart kid, she\u2019ll realize that.\u201d\n It was a curious mix of practicality and cowardice that they\u2019d never quite forgiven themselves for.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not cowardice.\u201d Gail was the marine chemist of the bunch, supplementing efforts at sterilization with the analysis of seawater samples. \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself think that way.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he\u2019d said.\n \u201cLearn. For fuck\u2019s sake, this isn\u2019t a movie,\u201d she\u2019d said, big body planted squarely in the door and Andy had remembered she had a brother. A twin brother, and a new nephew. Everyone at the lab had someone. \u201cDon\u2019t be so bloody selfish. There\u2019s so few of us left as it is. You\u2019d be throwing your life away. For nothing.\u201d\n For nothing. Because his little girl was already dead\u2014that was the implication, and the probability of such wasn\u2019t just high. It was astronomically high.\n \u201cDo you think she\u2019s gone?\u201d he\u2019d said to Mel, when he found her at island\u2019s edge, standing in the water and staring south.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Andrew had wanted to blame her, afterwards. If only Mel had held onto hope he might have been able to dredge some up himself. He might have gone, tried to find their daughter, or what was left of her. But if grief had twisted up nearly every part of him it had left self-awareness alone\u2014if only, he thought, because it made the grief the harder.\n He\u2019d believed Sarah dead as well; believed it in the very bones of him, and for reason.\n \u201cI\u2019m sick, Daddy,\u201d she\u2019d texted him. \u201cDon\u2019t come.\u201d\n It was the last time he\u2019d heard from her. The cell service went down two days later.\n He hadn\u2019t gone. It wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. It was staying that made the difference. It had kept them all alive.\n Andrew thought being alive might be enough, even when the new transmission came through. Not everyone agreed.\n \u201cSo what are we supposed to do? Stay here, like this island is a waiting room? Sun, sand, and starfish till we die? No thanks, mate.\u201d It was different for Trevor. He was young, still, he could more easily picture a future with children in it. For all the presentiments Andy had had with his own daughter, the twenty years of parenthood and practice that her presence made automatic, he found he could no longer picture the future now that he knew she would never be in it.\n \u201cYou think it\u2019s any different for me?\u201d said Mel. Part of the reason she\u2019d been so insistent on coming to the reef in the first place was the diving. It helped with the hot flushes, the tropic water cool enough even under daylight to mitigate the worst effects of menopause. \u201cYou at least could have more kids if you wanted,\u201d she said, and it was the cruelest thing he\u2019d ever heard.\n It was too much to expect, he thought, that apocalypse would destroy everything except his marriage. Maybe it was the strain, maybe it was the long silence that stood in the place where their daughter once did. It was hard for any couple to survive the death of a child. The death of everyone else didn\u2019t make it any easier, and that, perhaps, was the biggest betrayal so far. He could have coped with one disaster. Both at once was too much for any one person.\n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing here but death,\u201d said Gail. \u201cI know that you know that.\u201d\n \u201cJust because it\u2019s easy for you to leave doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for me,\u201d he said. Practically, she was right. Even if they all stayed, twelve wasn\u2019t enough to build a new society. There\u2019d be a handful of children born, perhaps, but as a group age and genetics were against them. More likely it\u2019d be a slow decline, the small population thinning down one by one as the starfish ate up the reef around them.\n It was a home that couldn\u2019t last, the laboratory\u2014but it was home yet, and his presence there his daughter\u2019s dying wish, that he could make and keep a future in it.\n Home. That\u2019s what it came down to. The ability to build a life, to retain it\u2014or to make it in other places. To reset expectations, to come to love different colors and different horizons. He\u2019d always thought of scientists as having a strange mix of idealism and pragmatism, a trusting reliance on method, but it still surprised him how many were willing to go.\n Apocalypse had burned away nostalgia.\n \u201cIt surprises me how many are willing to stay,\u201d said Mel. There was an eight to four split in favor of migration\u2014but it was also an argument that could be considered slowly, and more than one person had changed their mind, had decided to stay or go when they wouldn\u2019t before.\n Opinions, on the reef, flowed like the tides.\n The Crowns of Thorns came and died and kept coming. Andy could kill over a hundred an hour and still more of them came: a toxic, carnivorous collection of spines, blind hunger given hideous form. It was funny\u2014as a kid, growing up by the beach, he\u2019d liked starfish, had thrown them back into the water when he could. Not the same species, nothing prickly that could ever hurt him, and he\u2019d wandered through rock pools and tidal estuaries and reef fringes and that was what had decided him on his vocation: the breadth of life, the way the underwater bloomed.\n If someone had told him then that one day, the only thing keeping him sane would be the ability to dissolve starfish from the inside out, he would have kicked sand in their face. It didn\u2019t seem a biologist\u2019s job, somehow, the wholesale slaughter of a species.\n It turned out, comparatively, that his ability to slaughter was mediocre at best. If apocalypse had done nothing else, it had taught him incompetence.\n He couldn\u2019t kill enough to save anything.\n He couldn\u2019t save anything anyway.\n Incompetence didn\u2019t stop him diving. As long as he didn\u2019t let himself think about scales of destruction he was all right with the futility associated with the minor acts of it.\n \u201cIn a way I wish they were harder to kill,\u201d he said. There was something particularly bloodless about injection\u2014a quick stab of sodium bisulfate, deadly to Crown of Thorns but having no effect on the surrounding reef\u2014and it was over. The store of bisulfate was running low, but he could substitute with vinegar. The acid dissolved them from the inside out, which in another life had revolted him but now didn\u2019t seem anywhere near spiteful enough.\n \u201cYou think you\u2019ll feel better dismembering them?\u201d said Trevor.\n Dismembering was inefficient. Sometimes the limbs grew back, and when they did die it took ten times as long to kill them as it did with injections.\n He knew. He\u2019d tried. Grief punctuated itself with anger, and he\u2019d collected starfish in sacks, once, brought them to surface and shore and hacked them to death with a machete. It was harder than he\u2019d thought, more exhausting, and Trevor had found him up to his elbows in blood, screaming at consumption and fever.\n \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not their fault,\u201d he\u2019d said, wrestling the machete away before Andrew hurt himself with it. \u201cThey\u2019re only bloody starfish.\u201d\n Starfish that ate and ate and ate, that bred and swarmed and consumed everything. Everything.\n Andy was so damn tired of having nothing left.\n \u201cI\u2019m nothing now, am I?\u201d said Mel.\n He didn\u2019t know what she was. He just knew it wasn\u2019t enough.\n \u201cYou think if you can save the reef it\u2019ll make up for Sarah,\u201d she said.\n \u201cMel. We didn\u2019t even try.\u201d\n She was their daughter and they hadn\u2019t even tried.\n \u201cDo you honestly think we could have saved her?\u201d she said.\n Truth was, he didn\u2019t. She was halfway across a continent, and they would have died before getting to her.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not fucking fair,\u201d he said. He should have felt foolish when he said it, but instead he just felt bitter. Fairness, under apocalypse, was the first thing to go.\n \u201cI see her here all the time,\u201d he said.\n \u201cBut she was hardly ever here. It was only the once,\u201d said Mel. They\u2019d both sacrificed extensive fieldwork when Sarah had been at high school, had preferred to give her parents who were stable and present. It was only after she\u2019d gone to university herself that the two of them had come to the reef. \u201cFrom raising to grazing,\u201d he\u2019d said at the time, his focus changing from school runs to starfish. Sarah, embedding herself in the theater department of her chosen university, had never really come out of it again. She\u2019d visited the lab briefly, spent a couple of days on the island sunbathing and diving herself, but found the Crown of Thorns off-putting.\n \u201cLots of people do,\u201d he\u2019d said then, but what he said now was different. \u201cI remember her here,\u201d he said, and it was true. There wasn\u2019t a lot to remember\u2014she\u2019d not been there long enough, and the same few simple images repeated on him until he could almost see her embedded in the landscape, could almost feel her in the water behind him. Could almost see her face wrinkle up beneath the diving mask\u2014the distaste for starfish, the spreading, spiny blanket eating its way across the seafloor. \u201cHorrible little monsters,\u201d she\u2019d called them, and keeping those monsters in front of his face kept hers before him as well.\n He dived now more often than he did before. Said it was because he felt it gave him a purpose, even if that purpose was a doomed one. The truth was he remembered her more clearly beneath the waves, and in the cool pressure of the water it sometimes felt as if apocalypse was only a dream, and if he looked behind him she\u2019d be there, swimming along behind.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you ever feel that way?\u201d It was a conversation they\u2019d never had, him and Mel. At first it was because grief was a devouring thing. It pricked him all over; it ate him up. If hope was a thing with feathers then grief came with thorns, with a fever-multitude of arms and it left a scalded, scouring wasteland behind it.\n A conversation they\u2019d never had, until the prospect of leaving their daughter\u2019s ghost behind drew specters of another sort. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever see her here?\u201d he said.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to see her,\u201d said Mel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see those bloody starfish either. Not anymore. I\u2019m sick of the sight of them.\u201d They were the representation of failure\u2014for the two of them had failed. As conservationists, as parents. Their child was dead and the reef was overrun, and there was nothing they could do to change either of those things. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left for us here,\u201d she said.\n Nothing left for you, Andrew thought. It was a cruel thought, so he didn\u2019t say it aloud, but he didn\u2019t understand\u2014couldn\u2019t understand\u2014why she\u2019d give up the last connection, why she\u2019d want to go to a place that hadn\u2019t heard Sarah laugh, somewhere she hadn\u2019t swum or sunned or chattered.\n \u201cIt\u2019s too isolated here,\u201d said Mel. \u201cThere\u2019s too much time to think. I don\u2019t want to think. I need something to do.\u201d\n \u201cCome kill Crowns with me then,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDo you really think it\u2019ll make a difference?\u201d she said.\n Andy knew it made no difference at all.\n He went anyway. Starfish stretched before him\u2014dozens of them, hundreds. It didn\u2019t matter how many he killed; they just kept coming.\n \u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d It was a bald declaration, and all it made him want to do was laugh. Out of disbelief, mostly, because that was the death-knell of their marriage right there, in the spaces between things unsaid.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not worry you\u2019re feeling, that\u2019s guilt,\u201d he said.\n \u201cI\u2019m capable of feeling both at once.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019ve decided, then?\u201d The destruction of their life together was a simple thing, in the end. The loss of a continent, of a child, had been almost operatic in its emotionalism. There\u2019d been tears and grief and screaming, arguments for leaving and at last the decision to stay, clinging to each other for absolution and then the drifting apart when none came. The end, when it came, was almost sedate.\n \u201cI\u2019m not staying here,\u201d said Melanie. \u201cIt\u2019s not a life. Just a slow winding down. I can\u2019t stand that. Not forever.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to rebuild a civilization,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt seems so pointless. There\u2019s so little left. I just want to let it go . . . \u201d To watch the end of the world with as much grace as he could muster. It wasn\u2019t a lot, but there was a certain peace in it, in no longer having to fight. In letting the grief overwhelm him until he was so saturated with it that the weight of it became easier, and familiar.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how to live without it,\u201d he said, of that overpowering, crippling grief. \u201cAnd Mel, I don\u2019t think I want to. I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think it\u2019s any different for me?\u201d she said, and he could see their daughter in the shape of her cheekbones, the color of her eyes.\n He knew that it wasn\u2019t.\n \u201cI thought we\u2019d fight about it,\u201d he said. They were at the table, facing each other across and he reached out for her, held her hand in his own and felt the quiet amazement well up in him, the disbelief.\n Mel just looked at him, the skin under her eyes showing the bruises they had had for months. \u201cWhat good would it do?\u201d she said.\n After the bang, apocalypse lingered on in whimpers.\n In the end he was the only one who chose to remain, the other hold-outs relenting in the face of abandonment. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this,\u201d said Trevor. \u201cYou stubborn old sod. Why do you have to stay?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I do,\u201d said Andy.\n Trevor sighed. \u201cI\u2019m coming back for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a year. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll make a difference, but I don\u2019t like the idea of you changing your mind once we\u2019ve all buggered off. So if you do change your mind, hack it out for a year.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t let it beat you,\u201d he said.\n Mel didn\u2019t say anything. Their goodbyes had been long ones, a series of shattered splinters over time. Apocalypse had beaten them both together, he thought. They might survive it better apart.\n \u201cKill some starfish for me,\u201d she said. \u201cKill as many as you can if it makes you feel better.\u201d\n After they left Andy watched the boat until he could no longer see it. He didn\u2019t expect to cry, so he didn\u2019t.\n He didn\u2019t really feel any more hollow than before. The last man in Australia, the last that he knew of anyway, and all he could think was that it could have been worse. It seemed he was at his capacity for pain\u2014had settled into a state of numbness that might have been disconcerting if he\u2019d retained the ability to react to horror. Apocalypse had eaten that out of him, had swarmed through his flesh, over his skin, and the consumption had been monstrous but he had lived through it.\n The lab held all the memories he could cope with. He didn\u2019t see Mel in shadows, or out of the corner of his eye. Sometimes he saw Sarah. It wasn\u2019t, for the most part, enough\u2014but it was familiar. It was something he was used to. That\u2019s what the reef was, after all: the remains of dead things, a skeletal architecture with the soft parts gobbled up, and the gobbling was going on regardless of what happened at shores and above surfaces.\n That he was capable, still, of diving down to starfish and slaughtering them gave structure to his days, a sense of purpose if only a false one. There were too many; their hunger was too great. And he was one man alone, and he made no difference. The reef was turning to wasteland around him, the coral breaking down in the face of endless consumption and he couldn\u2019t bear to see it and do nothing, couldn\u2019t stand by again in helplessness while something he loved was devoured.\n \u201cNothing should eat up what you do,\u201d he said.\n He fed his wedding ring to a Crown of Thorns, forced it into flesh and watched the spiny little bastard engulf it whole.\n \u201cHope you choke on it, mate,\u201d he said.\n Octavia Cade is a New Zealand writer.

Most days, I\u2019m physically isolated from that world and as an introvert that actually works well for me. I\u2019ve described my genre social life as feast-or-famine. When I go to a convention, writing workshop, or other genre event, I want to soak up every minute of the creative energy it gives, and then I crash. The two pair rather nicely, and upon returning home, it forces me to get back to work.\n Despite being this close to the fire and having seen how the sausage is made, I can still get excited about working in this field and attending various events. Over the years, I\u2019ve been both fortunate and unfortunate enough to meet some of my favorite authors and artists. By and large, those encounters have been positive, but sometimes people just aren\u2019t what you expect. Maybe they\u2019re having a bad day. Maybe they\u2019re jetlagged. Maybe they\u2019re just rude. Maybe . . . I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ve become better at handling those situations as I\u2019ve grown older, but I can still be intimidated meeting certain people. It\u2019s not that I expect them to be awful, it\u2019s more that I don\u2019t want to bother them. At least that\u2019s what I tell myself.\n The sad thing is that I know it\u2019s not true. Sure, it is possible you could bother someone, but for the most part, if they are attending these events they either want to or expect to meet people. I didn\u2019t actually realize this until a few years after it was happening to me. I\u2019d routinely get emails or messages from fans of the magazine or an authors saying \u201cI saw you at XXX, but I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d I always regret these missed connections and the last thing I want to be taken away here isn\u2019t, \u201cDon\u2019t tell/approach Neil.\u201d In fact, I\u2019ve been doing some things to try to make it easier for people to introduce themselves. Before Worldcon, for example, I\u2019ll post on Twitter that an excellent icebreaker is a simple \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d Easy. Non-intimidating.\n Writers, well, you always have the opportunity to collect a rejection card, that is, assuming you\u2019ve sent me a story I\u2019ve rejected. What is this card? Well, it\u2019s a bit of a novelty item to mark your achievement of submitting a story to the magazine. The front bears the following image (which was one of our early covers):\n And the back says, \u201cThe bearer of this card has been officially rejected by Clarkesworld. Please be nice to them.\u201d (Some authors send me SASEs to get theirs, but I prefer handing them out in person.) Since it is always asked, if your story is accepted, you can\u2019t get a card for that story. You get paid and have your story in print. Recently I\u2019ve started giving them blue robot head buttons too. There are green ones for everyone else.\n So what sent me down this path now? Later this month at the Nebula Awards Conference, I\u2019ll have the opportunity to meet William Gibson for the first time. I read Neuromancer as a young computer science major in college and it had a significant impact on my connection to both of the fields I\u2019ve worked in: technology and science fiction. I know that there\u2019s a high likelihood that I\u2019ll try to talk myself out of bothering him. He hasn\u2019t done anything that should prevent me for thanking him for what that book did for me and even if he should turn out to be someone I might not like, he\u2019s still deserving of that thanks. [This ability was a gift from my heart attack. \u201cLife\u2019s too short\u201d makes it easier to move on.] I\u2019d regret not doing so later . . . there, now that I\u2019ve said it, I have to do it. Well, that or be a poor role model!\n Oh, and for the record, if you see me at a convention and I\u2019m not actively heading somewhere or in the bathroom (definitely not in the bathroom), then feel free to say hi, happy birthday, or \u201cdo you have some of those cards with you?\u201d Meeting people is one of the reasons I\u2019m there.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

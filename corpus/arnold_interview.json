L. Clark\u2019s The Unbroken, Tamsyn Muir\u2019s Gideon the Ninth and Harrow the Ninth, and many more. Among other accolades, he was a Jack Gaughan Award winner in 2016, has been a Chesley Award nominee every year since 2017, has been a Spectrum Award finalist twice, received Hugo nominations for Best Professional Artist for 2020 and 2021, and was a World Fantasy Award finalist in 2020 for Best Artist.\nArnold was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in a small town nearby. He interned at a software company to make money before figuring out what he wanted to do. He took an art class at LaGrange College and realized that art was absolutely for him. He then signed up for a two-year illustration program at Portfolio Center in Atlanta. In 2012 he dropped the program to take a job illustrating for Bento Box Entertainment, which lasted roughly a year, then worked for Floyd County Productions\u2019 Archer series for nine months. After this, he went full-time as a freelancer.\nIn 2014 Arnold went to the Illustration Masterclass workshop, then did a two-and-a-half-month online study with SmArt School, working with Gregory Manchess. Later that year, Irene Gallo hired Arnold for his first piece with Tor. \u201cI actually made a game of trying to adopt her taste early on\u2014she had folders on Facebook with curated images, and I\u2019d try to understand if I didn\u2019t like one, why; and if we did agree, that was good feedback. I tried to use her as a touchstone for elevating my own taste and understanding more about how buyers of images selected them.\u201d\nArnold lived in North Carolina for a little while, outside of Charlotte, then West Lafayette, Indiana, returning to Atlanta for college before moving out to Seattle, Bellingham, only to return again to Atlanta in 2018. \u201cI had infrastructure here in Atlanta. Good art friends and community. We had a figure-drawing group that was really strong. I injured my wrists, and we just didn\u2019t have a lot of support out where we had been; I needed camaraderie and friendship and sunshine. You know, things that help you heal, basically. I think I\u2019ve finally learned the lesson\u2014it seems like I\u2019m going to be here awhile.\u201d\nDo you feel like you got anything out of your experiences at LaGrange and Portfolio Center, in terms of your art?\nDefinitely. Although it\u2019s taken time to understand what I got out of each place. Expertise is an interest of mine. On my own time I read nonfiction. I read a lot about the growing field of expertise. Research says that it\u2019s helpful, if you\u2019re going to try to create someone who\u2019s an expert at something, to start them off in a small pond, because confidence is so important to progression. The confidence game is a big part of it, and LaGrange wasn\u2019t an art school. This had two major advantages: there was no one who was really, really good, so I could blossom and feel like I was good, which I think is especially helpful, since I was dreadful; and second, they didn\u2019t discourage you at all. The head of the program, Marcia Brown, basically let me do independent study after independent study, making up my own curriculum. I was the only person working digitally. They were like, yeah, if you wanna paint Magic cards, just keep doing quality work. I\u2019ve heard from people who went to fine art institutions that they learned good fundamentals, but they were discouraged from going into fantasy and science fiction. Not having that, always having the feeling that it could happen, those were important things. At Portfolio Center I had something equally great, which was finding a teacher who was a world-class comic book artist, who just happened to be teaching there for a little while, Brian Stelfreeze. He took me under his wing and taught me the basis of everything that I know now. So, they both contributed in different and important ways.\nHave you met many illustrators in the science fiction and fantasy field? Are people helpful, is there a sense of community?\nI\u2019ve met a lot of the people in the field, most of them go to Spectrum Fantastic Art Live to go to the award show, show their work, and meet each other. Or they show up at other events, like IlluXcon in Pennsylvania, or there\u2019s a new show that Bobby Chiu and crew started in California called Lightbox Expo. You can meet people pretty easily if you just go up and say hi. Your work is always a better introduction than anything you might say. But you bump into people and they\u2019re all really nice. Art\u2019s just naturally a humbling discipline, because you\u2019re never as good as it, and the further you go, the more you realize that. You don\u2019t start catching up to how good you can be, you start realizing how awful you were, and you can\u2019t believe anyone ever hired you.\nThere\u2019s a fine line to hit. You want to be part of some community, and you want to look at art, especially art that\u2019s better than yours, and interesting, newer, if you can find it. But there\u2019s a lot of random junk on the Internet. I have slowly cut off channels of communication and gotten more isolated over time. I still put information out there, like me and my buddy, fellow illustrator Micah Epstein, do a podcast where we talk about issues we face as illustrators, and we interview other artists. We use that as a vehicle to talk to the people that we\u2019re really interested in. The politics of art in the field are that if you want to talk about cool ideas and art with other artists that you respect, that you\u2019re kind of peers with, they mostly are down for that, and I think most of them are more interested to talk about art than anything else. I find the community really engaging in that vein.\nYou\u2019re up for a Hugo Award this year and last year you were a World Fantasy finalist. Have you attended genre conventions?\nLast year I would have gone, since I was nominated, but it was all virtual. So, I was at the virtual ceremony. I went to Boskone, people said I should be there. It was cool, Wesley Chu was there, and I worked on one of his books the month after that, so we got to meet. And Richard Anderson was there\u2014he\u2019s an amazing cover artist and lives in London, so it\u2019s rare that I get to bump into him. It was very concentrated, but interesting.\nHow did you initially become interested in science fiction and fantasy? What were some of your earliest memories of being drawn into genre?\nGenre doesn\u2019t feel like a separate thing. It goes as far back as I can remember. If you really think about it, most Disney movies are fantasy: it\u2019s some kind of secondary world, or there\u2019s some other element to it. I was the first child, so my parents were a little overprotective. I had all Disney movies until I was like eleven, and then my dad was like \u201cwe\u2019re gonna watch The Matrix,\u201d so that was my introduction to the medium\u2014it was The Little Mermaid, which is like, transforming fish women and such, that\u2019s basically fantasy, and then hard sci-fi with a bunch of violence and cursing; and it went on from there. The Lord of the Rings came to theaters and that seemed very normal, because it was so popular. My favorite movies before that had been Star Wars\u2014they just blew my mind. I was also a big Magic the Gathering player, or Pok\u00e9mon, all that stuff. Fantasy and sci-fi comprises so much of pop culture: TMNT, X-Men. I loved all of it.\nAre there specific artists or illustrators who have influenced or inspired you?\nSo many, it changes as you as an artist change. I didn\u2019t really know the names of artists when I was getting started, so then you\u2019re interested in anyone who\u2019s giving away education for free. There\u2019s an artist by the name of Mike Lim, he goes by the handle Daarken, and he had educational tutorials that were easy to find on the Internet, so of course I just loved him and loved his stuff. I learned a lot from watching his videos. Brian knew a bunch of people and introduced me to all kinds of different art. He really expanded my scope. He was the first person to show me Craig Mullins, probably the most influential and famous concept artist of all time, widely accredited, basically invented digital painting. I saw his work through Brian. There\u2019s an illustrator named David Grove whose work I was just obsessed with when I first started to work with Irene. She knew Dave Grove and her and Greg were buddies with him, he did some work for her.\nSeparately from my hobby and study of expertise, I am kind of an art history buff. It\u2019s fun to try and track back family trees of illustrators. There\u2019s usually an obscure teacher who had a couple of really strong progeny but was never as famous themselves. There\u2019s the Brandywine School in Pennsylvania where Howard Pyle taught N. C. Wyeth and Harvey Dunn and all these other famous illustrators. As you explore, you are influenced by everyone. In some ways, you can\u2019t progress as a creative individual in total isolation, because then what you make doesn\u2019t have bridges back to where other people are mentally, so they can\u2019t quite understand what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a shame to be polluted, in some ways, by seeing so much art. But if you don\u2019t study other peoples\u2019 pictures in the history of illustration and learn what can be done and what has been done, you kind of lack the grounding to take the next step.\nThese days I would say there are only a few digital painters that I really look at. Piotr Jab\u0142o\u0144ski, Jamie Jones, Craig Mullins, Theo Prins, Wesley Burt, Jeff Simpson, Ruan Jia. People who all work digitally way better than me, so I look up to their stuff.\nWhen you think of your work, and the pieces that you really like, what are the things that you are looking at?\nI can\u2019t abide any piece of art if it\u2019s not well drawn. If I\u2019ve done something and it has a nice design but the drawing is bad, I\u2019m not happy with it. After that, I\u2019d say design; and they\u2019re both important: if something doesn\u2019t have a good design or it\u2019s not well drawn, I basically feel like, \u201cI\u2019ll do better next time.\u201d Honestly, there are maybe ten pieces in my whole career that I still see as okay drawing and okay design. The rest, you\u2019re working toward something, and you didn\u2019t quite get there, yet you\u2019re learning.\nRecently I\u2019ve been learning a lot about color, and for a while my value designs would suffer, so that pieces were better in terms of color, but I still didn\u2019t really like them\u2014they didn\u2019t have everything, not everything you want. There are artists who have a very specific idea of what they want to say. Some people seem to have found a combination of things that work so well for saying what they want to say that they can throw out most of the rest. They\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t need perspective,\u201d and they really don\u2019t, and the work is better without it. I\u2019m a sucker for learning. There\u2019s no fundamental I want to throw away. Each new thing that I try to learn, after I learn it, if any of my art doesn\u2019t have it, I hate it.\nI\u2019ve been doing covers for about six years. A cover has to just slam you in the head, it has to grab the person to make them buy the book before they blink, before they even realize what they\u2019re looking at. They have to already love it before they know what it is. Covers are kind of the loudest form of art you can do. This year I got to do some illustrated books and interiors, which don\u2019t pay as much as covers, but you have chances to do things in images you might really want to do, there\u2019s usually more freedom; there\u2019s not as much pressure on each image to sell the book. When an image can have a striking design, good drawing, good color, and multiple layers of read, that is what I really value. For example, you look at a piece for a few seconds, you\u2019re not sure what it is, you think it\u2019s one thing, and then you realize it\u2019s something else, and maybe there\u2019s one more detail to appreciate in there.\nIllustration is a very immediate art form, so when you can make it ever so slightly temporal it really adds dimension to the work that I like. But sometimes, it\u2019s cool to just punch them in the face (laughs)! I can be cool with both!\nAre there things that that you struggle with, things you feel you\u2019re not really good at? Are there things that you avoid, or just haven\u2019t figured out how to do yet?\nI\u2019m a big believer in progress. There\u2019s always been lots of things I can\u2019t do, and those instantly become to-do items. Up until recently colors had been a weakness of mine. When I got started, I couldn\u2019t draw a horse worth anything. I was going to all kinds of lengths to take really tight photographic references that I could trace because I still loved well drawn work, but I didn\u2019t know how to make it. I knew how to design and get people\u2019s attention, but I didn\u2019t really know how to draw.\nThere\u2019s a sort of skill-slash-psychological evaluation that you can take online\u2014a lot of businesses use this for evaluating employees when they onboard them\u2014called the Clifton StrengthsFinder. It has about thirty-four different core human strengths you can have, and it ranks you, it determines your strengths, what you are terrible at, and what\u2019s in the middle. They encourage you to use your strengths, avoid weaknesses, and work on mitigating middle stuff. But I have this thing in my top five, which is that I thrive by working on my weaknesses. For some people, they thrive by working on what they\u2019re already really good at\u2014they called that maximizing\u2014but I\u2019m apparently better suited to working on whatever I\u2019m terrible at.\nEarly on, I couldn\u2019t draw faces, and I spent about a year where every night, when I went to figure drawing, I would only draw the face. Then, I couldn\u2019t draw legs, so same thing. I couldn\u2019t do perspective, so same thing. I tried to put in a lot of training to make sure that I can do whatever I\u2019m afraid of, and to not be afraid of it. Within the last two years I felt like I started to get a grip on how to do some things, finally, so right now I\u2019m feeling pretty good. There\u2019s not a lot that I\u2019m scared of, and I\u2019m relishing it. Just yesterday they released a cover I did for Tordotcom, a Kate Elliott book called Servant Mage. If you had asked me to paint a dragon three years ago, I\u2019d probably want to shit my pants. I can\u2019t take a photograph of that, so no, I can\u2019t do it. But I did the whole cover with no real reference, just with what I have in my head. That\u2019s where my obsession with expertise and training comes in. When I don\u2019t have to finish a project, I train and work on my weaknesses, because nothing feels worse as an artist than being afraid to do what you really want to do.\nDo you draw from life or from photo reference or both? Do you start with sketches on paper, do you work digitally\u2014what is your workflow like from concept to realization?\nI do all of that. I draw from life as much as I can. It\u2019s been tough during COVID because of safety concerns, but we\u2019ve got a small group of artists here in Atlanta that are vaccinated, and models that are vaccinated. I moved into a bigger house so we\u2019re going to be starting some life drawing again here within the next couple of months, I\u2019m really looking forward to that. I think life drawing is a really important pillar that many people abandon once they go more professional. It\u2019s hard to make time for things that don\u2019t pay, or that you are paying for instead of getting paid. Brian instilled in me a love of the process, and of getting better, as the most interesting thing about illustration, and then doing finished pieces as the byproduct of that.\nThe process is always changing, I\u2019m constantly trying to remove scaffolding and make more with less. When I started my career, I would do a pencil thumbnail, and once I liked that I would take it to the computer and refine it, and then once it got approved or if they had changes I\u2019d change it, and then once it was approved, I would hire models that looked like the characters I wanted to draw, rent costumes or armor or whatever, dress everybody up, put lights on, just like a film set, and take the stills I wanted. And then you work from that. At first, I was tied to the reference; over time, as I learned to draw, I was collaborating with the reference.\nThese days I\u2019ve been training in a way that lets me draw without reference, so I don\u2019t do thumbnails outside the computer anymore. Usually the ideas are there; as you practice it just gets more automatic, so a lot of times, by the time I sit down to draw, there are two or three scenes that are clear in my head. Not only clear in terms of what you want them to feel like, but how you will achieve that feeling. Then you sit down and see if you were right. When it doesn\u2019t work, you learn a lot.\nI did an illustrated edition of Network Effect by Martha Wells that was recently released, and I did the entire book with no reference, just to see if I could after a few years of training on drawing human anatomy. It was challenging, but it was pretty darn fun. When you start as an artist it\u2019s all fear, so I\u2019ve just been on a quest to try and get rid of that. If I\u2019m afraid to not use reference, alright, I won\u2019t use reference. I\u2019m afraid to use color? I\u2019ll use more color.\nIt\u2019s hard to say what the process will be like on any given image\u2014whatever the image demands is what you do sometimes. Whatever I need is what I do.\nThere are strong contrasts between dark and light in your overall portfolio. Talk a little bit about color choices, and the use of dark and light in your work.\nYou always think about the next thing, so I periodically look at the old stuff, but it\u2019s not where my mind is. You never know what someone else thinks about your work. The strong contrast, yeah, that\u2019s there, I think. As an artist you evolve by going too far one way, then too far the other, and then you find a way to combine those things. When I started out, I only knew how to make pieces successful if I had a clear silhouette, so I would have a clear silhouette, and that would give an impression of strong foreground against background, of figure against background. The Red Rising cover is just that dark red blob of him against the white, porcelain background. That\u2019s one way to create strong contrast, but you can also do it through lighting, like the Servant Mage cover: anywhere that there\u2019s light you get contrast, but it\u2019s not a silhouette exactly, and parts of the dragon, they merge with the background.\nYou\u2019re always trying to do more with less in art because you only have so much time. Your pieces are an ode to how much time you sat there. After I got injured from overworking, I thought, I just can\u2019t keep doing this, so it was a nice kick in the ass to actually learn new stuff. If you want to get somewhere new, you can\u2019t do what you did, what got you to where you are. It\u2019s not going to get you to the next place. You have to keep changing what you do.\nThe Gifting Fire cover was during the early part of my exploration of using color more in finished images. As I introduced more color, I realized I need more color to achieve certain effects of depth that value can\u2019t offer me, but I can\u2019t just put it wherever, there still has to be a system. Over time, value and color became more like one idea. You only introduce a new element in art when the elements you\u2019re using can\u2019t do it, so if I\u2019m doing the piece in value, if it\u2019s mostly a value piece, and I get a little bit of separation where I need one element to be separate from another, but there are no more values left to use, well then, I\u2019ll do it with color. Sometimes you start with color and then you only introduce value changes when you have to. The dragon piece is more like that\u2014it started more in color, and then I was able to flatten a lot of the values because the red wings separate themselves from the background, even though they are the exact same value. You don\u2019t need a value change there, and that frees up a value change that you can use to put lighting on top of the dragon, so that it has depth, and there\u2019s also a distance between it and the background.\nAs you pack in new fundamentals, they merge intuitively over time. It does take pieces that maybe aren\u2019t what you would normally make, or they don\u2019t feel like you to other people. At first, that\u2019s a big source of anxiety for a lot of artists, they want to always be recognized, they want to feel like, \u201cthis art is me.\u201d Eventually you realize, this art\u2019s not \u201cme,\u201d this is just, like, whatever I burped up after eating. \u201cMe\u201d is this group of skills that you\u2019re cultivating, the work is the byproduct of that. One of the reasons we do the podcast is so I can interview artists who are better than me, and find out how they got this way, what their secrets are. The people that I think are really amazing have that mindset. They\u2019re not concerned about posterity, they just like playing and learning and trying to make cool stuff. You can\u2019t fret over every piece. You\u2019re gonna make some good ones and you\u2019re gonna make some bad ones.\nWhich pieces are you most proud of, or which do you feel were most successful?\nMostly, they\u2019re not out yet. It\u2019s always the newest work. If it\u2019s on my website, I like it. I\u2019m not a big believer in sharing anything that you don\u2019t want to do more of. If you show that you paint dragons, people might hire you to paint dragons. You have to know that you\u2019d do it again before you share it.\nThere\u2019s some stuff that\u2019s not on my site yet, but which has been released. On Timandra Whitecastle\u2019s site you can see the cover for Queens of the Wyrd, and that came out really well. It has more color, but what I think of as my colors, colors that I like: warmer, darker palettes.\nI really like some of the pictures I did for the Grim Oak edition of Wizard of the Pigeons, by Robin Hobb (writing as Megan Lindholm). I\u2019m pretty happy with the covers for the Locked Tomb series, especially Harrow. If it\u2019s on the front page of my site, I like it the most; if it\u2019s on the \u201cmore work\u201d page, some of it I like, but it\u2019s not very good portfolio fodder.\nOne of the other impressions I had is that many of your pieces center or almost center people.\nI do some images where the people aren\u2019t in the middle, but to be honest, they don\u2019t get chosen by clients. I always provide alternate types of sketches, but the cover industry has things that it likes, things that sell better. Sometimes you work with someone that lets you get away with different kinds of stuff, but again, it\u2019s one of the reasons I like doing illustrated books. The cover for Network Effect was a robot in the middle but all the interiors are other kinds of images, like the dude at the very top of the composition just rock climbing.\nIn fact, when my career started, it was mostly those kinds of images. They weren\u2019t book covers, they were interiors, or they were for stories. So, they could be all kinds of things.\nWhere are you hoping to take your art? Do you have goals for your career, are there types of projects that you haven\u2019t done that you want to do?\nWhere my goals really lie are what I could do with my skills. I always want to be able to produce a better image today than I\u2019ve ever produced before, I always want to be getting better and less afraid of making imagery. It sounds kind of bad, probably, if you don\u2019t have that little bit of precursor, but wherever I can get paid the most for the least amount of time is always a good place, because you\u2019re buying yourself more time to train and get better.\nCovers are going to be hard to step away from because I keep upping my cover rate, and people keep paying. As long as that can happen, I can spend more time working on getting better. It should be a cycle that fuels itself. There\u2019s going to be a limit. Publishing is (compared to something like video games or movies) not a terribly rich industry, but it\u2019s got a lot of amazing people in it, and I love working in it. I love reading books. I\u2019m not someone that\u2019s really looking to move on from what I\u2019m doing: I really like what I\u2019m doing.\nI am starting to work on a few projects as a concept artist and that\u2019s pretty fun because, when you\u2019re doing a cover, you have to worry about the design of the image at large. Each individual element is really important. But when you\u2019re designing a character standing there, you have to worry about a different kind of design. How big does it look? How cool does it look? What if some part is bigger; if the helmet is smaller; if the suit is red\u2014but what if it has a strike through it? You have to match that with all this functional stuff. When I do a cover, I\u2019ll concept out some elements and then paint it, but it\u2019s just pure sandbox play. When you\u2019re doing character and creature designs and pieces like that, they\u2019re going to be used in other ways later, so that\u2019s pretty fun too. And it\u2019s another thing that a few years ago I don\u2019t think I would have been qualified for, but now, when I get those jobs, I think it sounds really fun and interesting. So maybe more stuff like that.\nI don\u2019t know, wherever lets me exercise my skills, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll go. But I expect to be doing covers as long as they\u2019ll have me.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

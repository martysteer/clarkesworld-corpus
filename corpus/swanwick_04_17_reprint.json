The silence reached out to touch infinity and then, \u201cI believe you\u2019re talking to me?\u201d a mech said.\nThe drunk laughed. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody else here sticking needles in his face, is there?\u201d\nThe old man saw it all. He lightly touched the hand of the young woman sitting with him and said, \u201cWatch.\u201d\nCarefully the mech set down his syringe alongside a bottle of liquid collagen on a square of velvet cloth. He disconnected himself from the recharger, laying the jack beside the syringe. When he looked up again, his face was still and hard. He looked like a young lion.\nThe drunk grinned sneeringly.\nThe bar was located just around the corner from the local stepping stage. It was a quiet retreat from the aggravations of the street, all brass and mirrors and wood paneling, as cozy and snug as the inside of a walnut. Light shifted lazily about the room, creating a varying emphasis like clouds drifting overhead on a summer day, but far dimmer. The bar, the bottles behind the bar, and the shelves beneath the bottles behind the bar were all aggressively real. If there was anything virtual, it was set up high or far back, where it couldn\u2019t be touched. There was not a smart surface in the place.\n\u201cIf that was a challenge,\u201d the mech said, \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to meet you outside.\u201d\n\u201cOh, noooooo,\u201d the drunk said, his expression putting the lie to his words. \u201cI just saw you shooting up that goop into your face, oh so dainty, like an old lady pumping herself full of antioxidants. So I figured . . . \u201d He weaved and put a hand down on a table to steady himself. \u201c . . . figured you was hoping to live forever.\u201d\nThe girl looked questioningly at the old man. He held a finger to his lips.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re\u2014what? Fifty years old? Just beginning to grow old and decay. Pretty soon your teeth will rot and fall out and your hair will melt away and your face will fold up in a million wrinkles. Your hearing and your eyesight will go and you won\u2019t be able to remember the last time you got it up. You\u2019ll be lucky if you don\u2019t need diapers before the end. But me\u2014\u201d he drew a dram of fluid into his syringe and tapped the barrel to draw the bubbles to the top\u2014\u201canything that fails, I\u2019ll simply have it replaced. So, yes, I\u2019m planning to live forever. While you, well, I suppose you\u2019re planning to die. Soon, I hope.\u201d\nThe drunk\u2019s face twisted, and with an incoherent roar of rage he attacked the mech.\nIn a motion too fast to be seen, the mech stood, seized the drunk, whirled him around, and lifted him above his head. One hand was closed around the man\u2019s throat so he couldn\u2019t speak. The other held both wrists tight behind the knees so that, struggle as he might, the drunk was helpless.\n\u201cI could snap your spine like that,\u201d he said coldly. \u201cIf I exerted myself, I could rupture every internal organ you\u2019ve got. I\u2019m two-point-eight times stronger than a flesh man, and three-point-five times faster. My reflexes are only slightly slower than the speed of light, and I\u2019ve just had a tune-up. You could hardly have chosen a worse person to pick a fight with.\u201d\nThen the drunk was flipped around and set back on his feet. He gasped for air.\n\u201cBut since I\u2019m also a merciful man, I\u2019ll simply ask nicely if you wouldn\u2019t rather leave.\u201d The mech spun the drunk around and gave him a gentle shove toward the door.\nThe man left at a stumbling run.\nEveryone in the place\u2014there were not many\u2014had been watching. Now they remembered their drinks, and talk rose up to fill the room again. The bartender put something back under the bar and turned away.\nLeaving his recharge incomplete, the mech folded up his lubrication kit and slipped it in a pocket. He swiped his hand over the credit swatch, and stood.\nBut as he was leaving, the old man swiveled around and said, \u201cI heard you say you hope to live forever. Is that true?\u201d\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t?\u201d the mech said curtly.\n\u201cThen sit down. Spend a few minutes out of the infinite swarm of centuries you\u2019ve got ahead of you to humor an old man. What\u2019s so urgent that you can\u2019t spare the time?\u201d\nThe mech hesitated. Then, as the young woman smiled at him, he sat.\n\u201cThank you. My name is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know who you are, Mr. Brandt. There\u2019s nothing wrong with my eidetics.\u201d\nBrandt smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like you guys. I don\u2019t have to be all the time reminding you of things.\u201d He gestured to the woman sitting opposite him. \u201cMy granddaughter.\u201d The light intensified where she sat, making her red hair blaze. She dimpled prettily.\n\u201cJack.\u201d The young man drew up a chair. \u201cChimaera Navigator-Fuego, model number\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease. I founded Chimaera. Do you think I wouldn\u2019t recognize one of my own children?\u201d\nJack flushed. \u201cWhat is it you want to talk about, Mr. Brandt?\u201d His voice was audibly less hostile now, as synthetic counterhormones damped down his emotions.\n\u201cImmortality. I found your ambition most intriguing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to say? I take care of myself, I invest carefully, I buy all the upgrades. I see no reason why I shouldn\u2019t live forever.\u201d Defiantly. \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t offend you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no, of course not. Why should it? Some men hope to achieve immortality through their works and others through their children. What could give me more joy than to do both? But tell me\u2014do you really expect to live forever?\u201d\nThe mech said nothing.\n\u201cI remember an incident happened to my late father-in-law, William Porter. He was a fine fellow, Bill was, and who remembers him anymore? Only me.\u201d The old man sighed. \u201cHe was a bit of a railroad buff, and one day he took a tour through a science museum that included a magnificent old steam locomotive. This was in the latter years of the last century. Well, he was listening admiringly to the guide extolling the virtues of this ancient engine when she mentioned its date of manufacture, and he realized that he was older than it was.\u201d Brandt leaned forward. \u201cThis is the point where old Bill would laugh. But it\u2019s not really funny, is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe granddaughter sat listening quietly, intently, eating little pretzels one by one from a bowl.\n\u201cHow old are you, Jack?\u201d\n\u201cSeven years.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m eighty-three. How many machines do you know of that are as old as me? Eighty-three years old and still functioning?\u201d\n\u201cI saw an automobile the other day,\u201d his granddaughter said. \u201cA Dusenberg. It was red.\u201d\n\u201cHow delightful. But it\u2019s not used for transportation anymore, is it? We have the stepping stages for that. I won an award once that had mounted on it a vacuum tube from Univac. That was the first real computer. Yet all its fame and historical importance couldn\u2019t keep it from the scrap heap.\u201d\n\u201cUnivac,\u201d said the young man, \u201ccouldn\u2019t act on its own behalf. If it could, perhaps it would be alive today.\u201d\n\u201cParts wear out.\u201d\n\u201cNew ones can be bought.\u201d\n\u201cYes, as long as there\u2019s the market. But there are only so many machine people of your make and model. A lot of you have risky occupations. There are accidents, and with every accident, the consumer market dwindles.\u201d\n\u201cYou can buy antique parts. You can have them made.\u201d\n\u201cYes, if you can afford them. And if not\u2014?\u201d\nThe young man fell silent.\n\u201cSon, you\u2019re not going to live forever. We\u2019ve just established that. So now that you\u2019ve admitted that you\u2019ve got to die someday, you might as well admit that it\u2019s going to be sooner rather than later. Mechanical people are in their infancy. And nobody can upgrade a Model T into a stepping stage. Agreed?\u201d\nJack dipped his head. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew it all along.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you behaved so badly toward that lush.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be brutal here, Jack\u2014you probably won\u2019t live to be eighty-three. You don\u2019t have my advantages.\u201d\n\u201cWhich are?\u201d\n\u201cGood genes. I chose my ancestors well.\u201d\n\u201cGood genes,\u201d Jack said bitterly. \u201cYou received good genes and what did I get in their place? What the hell did I get?\u201d\n\u201cMolybdenum joints where stainless steel would do. Ruby chips instead of zirconium. A number seventeen plastic seating for\u2014hell, we did all right by you boys.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s not. It was only the best we could do.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the solution, then?\u201d the granddaughter asked, smiling.\n\u201cI\u2019d advise taking the long view. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\u201cPoppycock,\u201d the mech said. \u201cYou were an extensionist when you were young. I input your autobiography. It seems to me you wanted immortality as much as I do.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, I was a charter member of the life-extension movement. You can\u2019t imagine the crap we put into our bodies! But eventually I wised up. The problem is, information degrades each time a human cell replenishes itself. Death is inherent in flesh people. It seems to be written into the basic program\u2014a way, perhaps, of keeping the universe from filling up with old people.\u201d\n\u201cAnd old ideas,\u201d his granddaughter said maliciously.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9. I saw that life-extension was a failure. So I decided that my children would succeed where I failed. That you would succeed. And\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou failed.\u201d\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t stopped trying!\u201d The old man thumped the table in unison with his last three words. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously given this some thought. Let\u2019s discuss what I should have done. What would it take to make a true immortal? What instructions should I have given your design team? Let\u2019s design a mechanical man who\u2019s got a shot at living forever.\u201d\nCarefully, the mech said, \u201cWell, the obvious to begin with. He ought to be able to buy new parts and upgrades as they come available. There should be ports and connectors that would make it easy to adjust to shifts in technology. He should be capable of surviving extremes of heat, cold, and moisture. And\u2014\u201d he waved a hand at his own face\u2014\u201che shouldn\u2019t look so goddamned pretty.\u201d\n\u201cI think you look nice,\u201d the granddaughter said.\n\u201cYes, but I\u2019d like to be able to pass for flesh.\u201d\n\u201cSo our hypothetical immortal should be, one, infinitely upgradable; two, adaptable across a broad spectrum of conditions; and three, discreet. Anything else?\u201d\n\u201cI think she should be charming,\u201d the granddaughter said.\n\u201cShe?\u201d the mech asked.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually not a bad point,\u201d the old man said. \u201cThe organism that survives evolutionary forces is the one that\u2019s best adapted to its environmental niche. The environmental niche people live in is man-made. The single most useful trait a survivor can have is probably the ability to get along easily with other men. Or, if you\u2019d rather, women.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the granddaughter, \u201che doesn\u2019t like women. I can tell by his body language.\u201d\nThe young man flushed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be offended,\u201d said the old man. \u201cYou should never be offended by the truth. As for you\u2014\u201d he turned to face his granddaughter\u2014\u201cif you don\u2019t learn to treat people better, I won\u2019t take you places anymore.\u201d\nShe dipped her head. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cApology accepted. Let\u2019s get back to task, shall we? Our hypothetical immortal would be a lot like flesh women, in many ways. Self-regenerating. Able to grow her own replacement parts. She could take in pretty much anything as fuel. A little carbon, a little water . . . \u201d\n\u201cAlcohol would be an excellent fuel,\u201d his granddaughter said.\n\u201cShe\u2019d have the ability to mimic the superficial effects of aging,\u201d the mech said. \u201cAlso, biological life evolves incrementally across generations. I\u2019d want her to be able to evolve across upgrades.\u201d\n\u201cFair enough. Only I\u2019d do away with upgrades entirely, and give her total conscious control over her body. So she could change and evolve at will. She\u2019ll need that ability, if she\u2019s going to survive the collapse of civilization.\u201d\n\u201cThe collapse of civilization? Do you think it likely?\u201d\n\u201cIn the long run? Of course. When you take the long view it seems inevitable. Everything seems inevitable. Forever is a long time, remember. Time enough for absolutely everything to happen.\u201d\nFor a moment nobody spoke.\nThen the old man slapped his hands together. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve created our New Eve. Now let\u2019s wind her up and let her go. She can expect to live\u2014how long?\u201d\n\u201cForever,\u201d said the mech.\n\u201cForever\u2019s a long time. Let\u2019s break it down into smaller units. In the year 2500, she\u2019ll be doing what?\u201d\n\u201cHolding down a job,\u201d the granddaughter said. \u201cDesigning art molecules, maybe, or scripting recreational hallucinations. She\u2019ll be deeply involved in the culture. She\u2019ll have lots of friends she cares about passionately, and maybe a husband or wife or two.\u201d\n\u201cWho will grow old,\u201d the mech said, \u201cor wear out. Who will die.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll mourn them, and move on.\u201d\n\u201cThe year 3500. The collapse of civilization,\u201d the old man said with gusto. \u201cWhat will she do then?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have made preparations, of course. If there are radiation or toxins in the environment, she\u2019ll have made her systems immune from their effects. And she\u2019ll make herself useful to the survivors. In the seeming of an old woman she\u2019ll teach the healing arts. Now and then she might drop a hint about this and that. She\u2019ll have a database squirreled away somewhere containing everything they\u2019ll have lost. Slowly, she\u2019ll guide them back to civilization. But a gentler one, this time. One less likely to tear itself apart.\u201d\n\u201cThe year one million. Humanity evolves beyond anything we can currently imagine. How does she respond?\u201d\n\u201cShe mimics their evolution. No\u2014she\u2019s been shaping their evolution. She wants a risk-free method of going to the stars, so she\u2019s been encouraging a type of being that would strongly desire such a thing. She isn\u2019t among the first to use it, though. She waits a few hundred generations for it to prove itself.\u201d\nThe mech, who had been listening in fascinated silence, now said, \u201cSuppose that never happens? What if starflight will always remain difficult and perilous? What then?\u201d\n\u201cIt was once thought that people would never fly. So much that looks impossible becomes simple if you only wait.\u201d\n\u201cFour billion years. The sun uses up its hydrogen, its core collapses, helium fusion begins, and it balloons into a red giant. Earth is vaporized.\u201d\n\u201cOh, she\u2019ll be somewhere else by then. That\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\u201cFive billion years. The Milky Way collides with the Andromeda Galaxy and the whole neighborhood is full of high-energy radiation and exploding stars.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s trickier. She\u2019s going to have to either prevent that or move a few million light-years away to a friendlier galaxy. But she\u2019ll have time enough to prepare and to assemble the tools. I have faith that she\u2019ll prove equal to the task.\u201d\n\u201cOne trillion years. The last stars gutter out. Only black holes remain.\u201d\n\u201cBlack holes are a terrific source of energy. No problem.\u201d\n\u201c1.06 googol years.\u201d\n\u201cGoogol?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s ten raised to the hundredth power\u2014one followed by a hundred zeros. The heat-death of the universe. How does she survive it?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll have seen it coming for a long time,\u201d the mech said. \u201cWhen the last black holes dissolve, she\u2019ll have to do without a source of free energy. Maybe she could take and rewrite her personality into the physical constants of the dying universe. Would that be possible?\u201d\n\u201cOh, perhaps. But I really think that the lifetime of the universe is long enough for anyone,\u201d the granddaughter said. \u201cMustn\u2019t get greedy.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe so,\u201d the old man said thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe so.\u201d Then, to the mech, \u201cWell, there you have it: a glimpse into the future, and a brief biography of the first immortal, ending, alas, with her death. Now tell me. Knowing that you contributed something, however small, to that accomplishment\u2014wouldn\u2019t that be enough?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nBrandt made a face. \u201cWell, you\u2019re young. Let me ask you this: Has it been a good life so far? All in all?\u201d\n\u201cNot that good. Not good enough.\u201d\nFor a long moment the old man was silent. Then, \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI valued our conversation.\u201d The interest went out of his eyes and he looked away.\nUncertainly Jack looked at the granddaughter, who smiled and shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s like that,\u201d she said apologetically. \u201cHe\u2019s old. His enthusiasms wax and wane with his chemical balances. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d The young man stood. Hesitantly, he made his way to the door.\nAt the door, he glanced back and saw the granddaughter tearing her linen napkin into little bits and eating the shreds, delicately washing them down with little sips of wine.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, February 1999.\nMichael Swanwick is one of the most acclaimed and prolific science fiction and fantasy writers of his generation.

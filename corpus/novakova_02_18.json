Suddenly a flash from somewhere (above? where was above?) illuminated the whole ocean, and in that instant, she could see a school of grunions swimming past: hundreds of silvery gleaming bodies together in a mass so alien and intimidating. So beautiful. Light reflecting off their sleek bodies and silver-lined black eyes.\n The darkness returned, but it didn\u2019t feel the same. She could feel the hundreds of eyes watching her. Irrational, yes. But this moment was beyond rationality.\n Another lightning strike somewhere far away revealed a peculiar sight.\n Chubs? she thought with an unnatural calm. How strange. Must be the storm . . .\n However, still no sign of other people.\n When the next lightning bolt lit up the murky waters a moment later, she glimpsed something else. She knew she ought to feel dread, fear, panic.\n But she was far beyond that too.\n \u201cReady?\u201d\n \u201cReady.\u201d\n \u201cReady,\u201d echoed a second voice, and the three divers submerged together.\n As soon as she entered water, Mariana Aguayro ceased feeling anxious. She was in her element. No matter what happens next, she\u2019s where she belongs; and she had trained for what happens next.\n It was difficult to tell whether the same applied to Hector Hodges beside her. Even though the full-face mask offered a better view of his face than usual diving masks, she could only imagine how he was feeling. In her imagination, however, he was still as nervous as on their way here.\n Iku was already ahead of them, holding his sea scooter like it was a part of his own body. If she felt in her element here, he seemed born in the ocean.\n They continued in silence. No need to speak, even if the transceivers would allow them to. They could view speaking as a security risk even here, still far from their destination. The fish-like scooters carried them forward. They could take a moment\u2019s rest for now. Mariana knew they\u2019d need it.\n Even though they were not descending yet and it was early, light faded quickly around them. Mariana thought of the darkening skies above. No sane person would go for recreational diving today. They remained alone but for a few by-the-wind sailors above, and some moon jellyfish. The storm was coming. For them, it was ideal.\n Iku turned and signaled \u201cdown.\u201d She and Hector copied.\n The waters grew murkier as they descended slowly. Usually, the visibility would be good. But today, the currents were disturbed by the approaching storm. The water was considerably colder than usual at this time of the year. Mariana could still see Iku\u2019s silhouette beneath, but visibility was dropping quickly.\n Finally, she glimpsed the bottom, or at least she thought so. On the sandy shelf, there was no reef to look for, nothing to use as a beacon. Her dive computer showed the depth of 110 feet, same as the analog depth gauge she had refused to leave home.\n Upon reaching the bottom, Iku signaled for them to stop. Mariana\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n It\u2019s here. We\u2019re really doing it. Just as we practiced.\n It was time to leave the scooters and anchor them here, where they could find them on their return trip. If there is one. Even in the murky shade, Mariana saw the fear in Hector\u2019s eyes. In contrast, Iku\u2019s face was almost serene. She imagined hers full of anticipation.\n We\u2019re going to free freedom itself.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Iku gestured.\n Hug the bottom. Kick ever so slowly. The rhythm we finally got right last week.\n A week ago, at the same depth, but in clear water on a sunlit day tens of miles away from here, Mariana was trying to pass as a fish. She could see Hector swimming some ten feet from her. Iku floated somewhere overhead, monitoring them as always.\n Hug the bottom. Go slowly. Use the add-ons on the suit to simulate fish movement, she recited in her mind. She should probably feel nervous. But being underwater always had a strangely calming effect on her. Hearing your breath, the pounding of your heart, and the ocean surrounding you, while you moved freely in its soothing cold embrace . . . Sometimes she wished she could stay.\n \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any motion detectors on the bottom,\u201d Iku had said to them earlier. \u201cToo many things would set them off. They would rather rely on autonomous guard bots, a few ROVs and aquamesh around the site.\u201d\n Hugging the bottom therefore seemed to be a good approach strategy, and Iku provided the rest.\n Now they reached the improvised aquamesh: just a fishing net in this case, no fiber-optics. When Iku gave the signal, Mariana and Hector started cutting through it.\n He was faster than she this time, having improved a lot. Mariana got used to the full-face mask and closed cycle rebreather already in their first test dive. Hector had a little trouble adjusting to the mask, but he too was an experienced diver and now he seemed just as accustomed to the equipment.\n Going through, she signaled and went first.\n She saw the outline of their target in the silty waters. Suddenly, a shock wave hurled her onto the bottom and made her earbuds ache. She was scared and disoriented . . . for a few seconds. Then she kicked fast toward where she thought the target was. She couldn\u2019t see a thing through the upraised mud. We should have thermal, occurred to her. She wasn\u2019t sure any thermovision mask even existed, but Iku apparently had access to a lot of gear she hadn\u2019t known about.\n Hector was beside her in another second. They reached the target, pulled the waterproof Taus and cords and got to work in perfect sync. The screens shone bright in this dim bottom world.\n \u201cIncoming,\u201d Iku\u2019s voice sounded suddenly in their ears. Mariana turned around to intercept the danger and readied her underwater gun. But nothing happened. Then Hector announced: \u201cGot it.\u201d\n The timer showed eighteen minutes, ten seconds. Best result so far.\n A diver silhouette approached.\n Ready, Iku signaled. Up.\n When they were ashore and stripping from the diving gear, Mariana felt oddly elevated. We did it. We\u2019re well under the limit. It really can be done!\n But the greatest news was yet to come.\n \u201cThere could be severe storms coming next week,\u201d Iku announced as he closed the trunk with all the gear and stood by his car, an inconspicuous older wagon. \u201cThe timing is ideal. Augur will be conducting some site reliability tests elsewhere. Their guard will be high, but it always is, and they would be more vulnerable at the same time. Be prepared. The next time, we go live.\u201d\n It was exhilarating to hear that. Next time, it\u2019s real. They\u2019re gonna rob and sabotage an Augur datacenter.\n In the wake of their successful dive and Iku\u2019s announcement, they had made a mistake. Mariana would usually take a bus back to LA; after all, Iku had all the diving gear, she didn\u2019t need to carry anything. But Hector had offered to drive her home.\n \u201cHe\u2019s being too paranoid,\u201d he waved off Iku\u2019s earlier advice. (Do not ride together. Do not call each other. Do not let your paths cross any more than they would before you had met.). \u201cAnd he\u2019s not here. Are you going to wait an hour for your bus, or be back in LA at that time?\u201d\n It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get home earlier . . .\n They spent the whole ride talking. It seemed like a mere moment when he stopped before her home.\n \u201cWanna come upstairs for a drink?\u201d she said on an impulse. Hector wasn\u2019t her usual type. She wasn\u2019t into older guys and typically avoided anyone from IT, if mostly for professional reasons, but the excitement of their dive and the upcoming op must have clouded her judgment. The fact that they had shared a secret from the rest of the world may have played a role.\n He stayed for several hours. But when she said \u201cyou should go,\u201d he just nodded and left. They didn\u2019t see each other again up until this morning, after Iku had called them. It was time.\n She couldn\u2019t quite shake off the disturbing sensation that Iku somehow knew.\n Hector was the first to notice the bots. Above, he gestured.\n The AUVs were circling the perimeter in quasi-random patterns. They patrolled for unusual motion, light, heat signatures, sound, or transmissions. Though Mariana knew about them, her heart still skipped a beat when she saw that one was nearing her position.\n Calm down and swim. This was to be expected.\n The AUVs continued on their way.\n The style they\u2019d practiced seemed to pay off. They had passed as fish.\n Then she saw what they were looking for. The mesh.\n The real danger would only lie beyond that\u2014if they managed to get through.\n Mariana glanced at Iku, or rather tried to, but she couldn\u2019t see him. The silt whirled beneath them and decreased visibility even further.\n But something changed. She glimpsed movement. Silvery glint. Eyes. So many . . .\n Pacific mackerel, she thought.\n It didn\u2019t stop with them.\n So he did it; Iku released a batch of pheromones to lure the fish. The schools would provide more cover for them while they try to get through the mesh.\n Iku went first, followed by the fish like some strange pied piper.\n A sudden if feeble flash of light illuminated even these murky depths for a fraction. The storm above had started.\n It would disturb the fish. It would also disturb the AUVs and sensor nets. Motion, thermals, sonar echo\u2014all would be obscured. A lot of unusual activity just might pass unnoticed in a storm . . .\n Iku approached the mesh. Mariana waited while he began attaching long stretches of optical fiber to the mesh. Then she saw the signal. She swam toward him and began cutting through the fiber-optic mesh, while Hector approached from another side. Another lightning struck somewhere above.\n The final cut. Nothing visibly changed. No dazzler blinded them; no sound weapon thrust them away; no AUVs approached.\n They swam through. Shapes began emerging from the mist-like whirling silt. Their ghostly glow felt otherworldly. There was something surreal about the server boxes and glowing displays down here: a true snippet of another world.\n How did I ever end up here? Mariana wondered.\n Mariana Aguayro sometimes wondered how their lives would turn out if the Sun didn\u2019t misbehave. Just one peculiar cycle of increased solar activity. It was enough to first render billions of investments in satellite communications lost, and to make other such ventures too risky for another decade; and they could count themselves lucky that the storms only caused occasional blackouts.\n Cables always held most traffic, but Internet giants promised free worldwide web connection for anyone on the planet. High-speed satellite connection in the furthermost, poorest village on Earth; it was too good to last. It almost hadn\u2019t even started before the unprecedented solar storms fried most satellites, high-altitude balloons, and many land facilities too. Solely dependent on cable connections, with the corporations shaken badly and world politics already in disarray, it was a recipe for a slow plunge into unobtrusive dystopia.\n If it didn\u2019t happen, I may have gone to college.\n If it didn\u2019t happen, we wouldn\u2019t have access outages for days.\n If it didn\u2019t happen, we might not have lost our freedoms so easily.\n She remembered net neutrality, constant quick access to information, and reliable communication from her childhood. Chatting with friends online without worrying about the price or whether the messages would get through at all. Browsing encyclopedias and magazines without end. No outages lasting over an hour. Sometimes it made her feel old, despite not being even in her thirties.\n She also remembered a semblance of privacy. Yes, people willingly, if unwittingly granted access to highly personal information to any stupid app, but there was at least a pretense of legal protection, at least some hope that individuals could persist against governments and corporations . . .\n This, too, had been taken away, with the help of Augur.\n Maybe that\u2019s why Mariana liked diving so much. The fish, corals, and crustaceans didn\u2019t care for human skirmishes. She could escape into their world, but even there, she would see the discomforting signs of human presence above. Little had been done to keep the oceans clean. Even down there, in her dream world, Mariana could not avoid getting angry.\n So she\u2019d started rebelling. Tiny steps, at first. Then she\u2019d gotten more daring.\n Being a hacker was nothing like in the movies she\u2019d watched\u2014and downloaded, impossible now\u2014as a kid. But it was exhilarating nonetheless when she and the fission-fusion crews sometimes succeeded after weeks or months of dull work. Her life became a series of mood swings, and at times she also wondered whether it would have been so, had she been let to live a normal life.\n She didn\u2019t know how Iku found her.\n He sat next to her one day on the beach, an inconspicuous black man of slender build and indeterminate age, and told her without any fuss that he wanted to hire her for a special job. One that involved both her computer hacking and diving expertise.\n She could have said no. She didn\u2019t know the stranger at all, nor did he mention having any contacts in common.\n But it sounded like the kind of offer you cannot refuse.\n She was just a few kicks away from the first server when the world broke.\n First, there was light.\n A bright flash blinded her for a moment, and a staccato of bright beams followed. No time to think about that. No time to prepare for the sound.\n It threw her away like a punch in the chest. Her limbs flailed around her. She felt as if air was knocked out of her lungs. Her chest and stomach hurt badly. She couldn\u2019t breathe. And the lights were still there, burying themselves into her skull . . .\n Dazzlers and an ultrasonic pulse, some calculating part of her mind said. Shouldn\u2019t cause permanent damage, only stun or injure. Get it together.\n She kicked away before another cavitation could hit her. Only then she turned and looked back, grasping the underwater gun on her belt, though wary of using it.\n But it was no longer necessary.\n \u201cDisabled it,\u201d Iku\u2019s voice sounded in her ears for the first time during the dive. Stealth didn\u2019t matter anymore, and they would need to use the transceivers soon anyway.\n She looked around. \u201cHector?\u201d\n She didn\u2019t see him. Nor did she hear any reply. She was about to call him again, when Iku spoke: \u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d\n Something in his tone made her shiver inwardly.\n Iku moved smoothly, shark-like, toward a dark silhouette barely visible in the silt. She glimpsed him link his suit\u2019s computer to Hector\u2019s. As she swam nearer, she could see him activate the adrenaline pump in Hector\u2019s suit.\n The dark silhouette moved, and Mariana heard a sharp intake of breath in the comms. \u201cW-what happened?\u201d\n \u201cDazzler and cavitation,\u201d Iku said. \u201cYou\u2019ll come to. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n Mariana would have liked to see whether Hector was okay, but Iku was right; there was little time. They had to get in, and Hector Hodges, a disgruntled former Augur employee wishing to take revenge accompanied ideally by large sums of money, was necessary to manage it quickly.\n The servers were just two dozen feet away. This near, AUVs wouldn\u2019t use sonic pulses to knock them out; too much risk for the equipment.\n Hector and Mariana got to work on one rack, Iku moved to another.\n \u201cYou all right?\u201d she asked Hector quietly, mask to mask; no need for Iku to overhear.\n \u201cThink so,\u201d he spoke. Even in these conditions, she could hear his strained breath.\n Broken ribs? Internal bleeding? she thought of the risks of cavitation. It was by no means a non-life-threatening weapon. Down here, every injury counted more.\n The firewall held fast, but Mariana tried a few new exploits, while Hector worked his angle.\n Still nothing . . . Would they have to use plan B and just DDoS Augur without making use of any of the data stored here?\n Mariana glanced at her computer. At this rate, she had an hour of resurfacing to look for. An hour within which anything could go wrong.\n \u201cWe\u2019re there,\u201d Hector said.\n Mariana\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\n We\u2019re really there. Inside Augur\u2019s heart . . . about to seize it and tear it out.\n She just sent an invite to a feast on the company\u2019s internal files to a dozen informal hacker groups; most of them hopelessly idealistic anarchists, some strategically chosen groups that were in for money or mainstream politics, which translated to money anyway.\n Her head almost spun.\n For a second, she was tempted to look up Iku, regardless of whether the alias had any ties to his real self. Who, or what . . . But no\u2014there was no time to waste.\n Now to erasing the user metadata, and all the surveillance we can . . . To watch the watchmen for once. To free ourselves before they load the backups\u2014but others will be ready for that. Let it run another half an hour, please, and then we can have a DDoS as a cherry atop the cake.\n There was still a chance that Augur noticed only now what they were doing and couldn\u2019t get in touch with its AUVs here because of the storm.\n But the storm would also complicate their ascent. They\u2019d all realized the possibility they\u2019d become martyrs, but none wanted to reconcile with that. Not without a fight.\n \u201cIku?\u201d she spoke.\n No answer.\n \u201cCan\u2019t resurface now,\u201d Hector pointed above. Even at this depth, they could see the lightning flashes. Even through the transceiver connection, Mariana heard the strain in his voice. Hold on. We\u2019ll help you ascend, she thought. But where was Iku? She decided to find out and kicked slowly. Even moving this carefully, she almost caused a silt out. That\u2019s why she didn\u2019t see what happened next.\n She was already at the further rack, and only heard the gasp and ragged, muffled breaths. She turned back, but another shape shot forward alongside her: Iku. She\u2019d never think a diver could move so fast and smoothly, truly like a fish.\n Hector\u2019s body was jerking as if electrocuted. Mariana glimpsed some strange, ghostlike shape around him in the light of her LED torch, and realized that he was being electrocuted.\n But Iku was already there, grasping the thing she could barely see, and pulling it away from Hector.\n The battle resembled a surreal ballet: a diver against a barely visible translucent shape, swirling and writhing amidst silt. It was entrancing. The Finnish Kalevala myth came to Mariana\u2019s mind, because Iku Turso in this instant truly resembled some kind of ancient sea monster like his namesake in the epic: sometimes depicted as a horned creature, sometimes a sea serpent, sometimes octopus-like, but always, always deadly.\n The translucent robot sank to the bottom gently.\n Iku turned to Mariana. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d\n She wasn\u2019t checking her Tau; she was checking Hector.\n He was alive.\n But even without glancing at his computer, Mariana knew he wasn\u2019t going to make it. His suit was inflating visibly, and he started ascending. His face was constricted with pain. He was still conscious, and very much aware that this was just a brief period before certain death.\n I\u2019m so sorry, she thought.\n \u201cHe was electroshocked,\u201d Iku said on the transceiver. \u201cInvisible robot creeps near you, pierces your skin with electrodes, shocks you, and doesn\u2019t threaten nearby devices. Didn\u2019t know they were in use already.\u201d\n Sizzling rage got ahold of Mariana. Hector was dying, and Iku was reciting his knowledge of the damn robot that killed him!\n \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she somehow made her voice sound measured.\n \u201cWe continue our work.\u201d\n \u201cNo!\u201d\n \u201cYesss,\u201d Hector hissed through the pain. His gaze met with Mariana\u2019s. They were almost mask to mask. The eerie glow of the underwater servers made his face appear ghostlike. She was looking at it, and so didn\u2019t see him pull a knife from his belt and cut at his own drysuit.\n The inflation stopped, and then reversed. Mariana took a split-second to realize what he\u2019d done. The stupid fool! He flooded his own suit to stop it from inflating. He\u2019d never be able to ascend, even if he got rid of all the weights at once, and he\u2019d get hypothermic in the matter of minutes.\n \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cYou get out. They . . . seem to know.\u201d\n \u201cContinue data transfer while you can,\u201d Iku instructed him, and signaled to Mariana to follow him. She lingered for a second, put her mask to Hector\u2019s and turned off her transceiver for a moment. Only then did she realize she had absolutely no idea what to say.\n He solved it for her. \u201cGoodbye, sweet girl,\u201d he struggled to speak, but somehow he managed for the words to sound soft. \u201cGo.\u201d\n Iku was circling the center, and Mariana noticed he was planting something in semi-regular intervals. She swam to it.\n Charges.\n Iku waited for her at the far end of the datacenter and signaled to leave.\n \u201cExplain first!\u201d she spoke regardless of knowing that Hector will likely hear it. He had the right to know.\n \u201cDestroying the center will set Augur back many months, if not years. Time for us to act.\u201d\n It made sense, she knew it. Just . . . leaving Hector behind, even if the best he could hope in otherwise would be surviving the hypoxia or a stroke after rapid ascent, if they could somehow get him out of his suit and share their air with him . . . No. Hector Hodges was gone and knew it very well.\n \u201cWhat did you really want to gain from this?!\u201d she said.\n Iku\u2019s lips moved as if in silent prayer. His face, illuminated by the datacenter\u2019s glow, looked inhuman, almost demonic.\n \u201cWhat anyone wants,\u201d he whispered. \u201cFreedom.\u201d\n \u201cWho do you think our Iku really is?\u201d Hector had said back during their ride home.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cThe equipment he got us, his knowledge of the facility . . . I think he\u2019s a frogman.\u201d\n \u201cOurs, or someone else\u2019s?\u201d\n Hector laughed quietly. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering too.\u201d\n \u201cHe could just be Augur\u2019s. Don\u2019t they have their own frogmen? Military-grade stuff?\u201d\n \u201cI guess so. I even heard some rumors about . . . enhanced soldiers. But I\u2019d think they watch theirs more carefully.\u201d\n \u201cLike they watch you?\u201d Mariana raised a brow.\n Hector seemed unperturbed. \u201cThat\u2019s different. I\u2019m unimportant.\u201d\n Mariana didn\u2019t question that; they both were. Was Iku too?\n \u201cSomeone has to clean the facility,\u201d she spoke finally. \u201cBiofouling can be a problem after less than a year down below. Not speaking of tech maintenance.\u201d\n \u201cIku isn\u2019t an IT crowd guy.\u201d\n \u201cI never said he was. He could have posed as one.\u201d\n \u201cI dunno.\u201d Hector shrugged. \u201cSomething seems . . . off about him to me. Can\u2019t explain it.\u201d\n Mariana snorted, but it was just a facade; in fact, she felt the same about Iku.\n \u201cThere must be a lot of people outside our scope of abilities,\u201d Hector continued. \u201cNot just the H+ nerds who implant magnets into their fingers and bloody Fitbits under the skin. I mean gene-modded people, or laced, or fitted with optogenetic circuits, enhanced senses, strength . . . Don\u2019t you think someone must have tried that already?\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said evasively. She didn\u2019t like to think of how she only saw the surface layer of the world, and how much might be going on underneath, concealed by Augur and others like them. It led to paranoid thinking, and she saw enough of that in her mother to know that she wanted to avoid that at any cost.\n She was glad when Hector changed the topic and resumed flirting with her.\n \u201cFreedom?\u201d she said once they were nearing the aquamesh. \u201cFrom what?\u201d\n Iku didn\u2019t answer. She could think of a thousand options, but recalled her conversation with Hector back in the car all too vividly. But maybe she just felt guilty about Hector.\n They began making another hole in the mesh; the first site was likely compromised.\n \u201cFrom my creators and controllers,\u201d Iku spoke suddenly. \u201cEveryone will know now.\u201d\n She wanted to ask more, but then there was light.\n Something pushed her aside\u2014no, someone, it was Iku\u2014and after that she was pushed into the bottom with considerable force.\n \u201cGo\u2014\u201d she heard Iku, but his voice was cut out.\n Silt was everywhere.\n And then all was darkness.\n \u201cWhere are the bones, the relics, of the brave and the timid, the good and the bad, the parent, the child, the wife, the husband, the brother, the sister, the lover, which have been tossed and scattered and buried by the washing, wasting, wandering sea?\u201d\n . . .and they dug tunnels in the silt and mud, bore into the bottom like worms. Blind, constrained, deaf but for the sound of their breath.\n She soothed herself with this image from the past.\n As a child, Mariana had loved stories of her underwater heroes. Cousteau and his diving saucer sub. Franz\u00e9n and his men, excavating the Vasa from her infamous grave in the Stockholm harbor. In the decades after she sank in 1628, pioneer divers submerged into the 32-m depth in bells filled with air to excavate some of the treasures the ship had carried. Then, she lay forgotten and silt buried her, until amateur marine archeologist Franz\u00e9n found her again. To un-sink the ship, they had to dig tunnels beneath her to secure her, and tow her into the harbor.\n Mariana remembered the story now, as she clawed her way desperately through the silty bottom. She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been out, since she had no way to look at her dive computer, but hopefully she only lost consciousness for a few seconds. She couldn\u2019t have been buried deep, nothing could do that; but was she trying in the right direction? Fear almost got ahold of her.\n Finally, she felt little resistance.\n She emerged from a silt grave into pitch dark waters.\n \u201cIku?\u201d she tried.\n Only silence answered her.\n She assessed the damage. Her torch was lost, her rebreather got damaged, her trimix would soon run out, and she was still lucid enough to realize she was hypothermic. Her computer was broken, and she lost track of time.\n So she did the only thing she could: started ascending as fast as she dared.\n Another bright flash of lightning somewhere above. The lone chub, normally a river fish, was swimming desperately in this unwelcoming strange place. Mariana just floated with current. She started feeling strangely elated. Hypoxia? Or just cold? she could still guess.\n A flash revealed a school of sardines gazing at her with a thousand little eyes.\n Big brother watches you, she mused. Even here. Did we change anything?\n Lightning\u2014and the briefest of glimpses of a dreadful shape. The strange mask and suit . . .\n Frogman. Augur\u2019s. Who else?\n They were fast, or perhaps there were more secrets she knew nothing about . . . She realized she ought to feel dread, fear, panic. But she was just cold and tired.\n Maybe they didn\u2019t win. But they didn\u2019t exactly lose, either.\n A series of lightning bolts. The ominous figure, strobing toward her like in a stop-motion movie. And behind it\u2014\n Iku-Turso, son of Old-age, ocean monster, Mariana recalled dreamily the verses she\u2019d looked up in the library.\n In the murky ocean, illuminated only by lightnings further away now, she watched the strange battle unfold like a magic lantern projection. How beautiful, her mind marveled. Years ago, she\u2019d seen the black jellyfish. It was huge, unearthly, menacing, infinitely elegant. Mariana had almost forgotten to breathe. Dread had seized her. She had only been wearing a spring suit, and the thought of the giant jellyfish stinging her had almost paralyzed her. But her sense of wonder had eventually won. She\u2019d been captivated by the alien motion of the creature and its colors\u2014a whole palette of purple, green, black, scarlet, and more colors as the light changed. It didn\u2019t look like an animal at all.\n Neither did those two struggling monsters look human.\n Who are you, Iku? Mariana mused.\n Suddenly, the dark waters turned even darker, as if ink had spilled in the sea. She realized it was blood.\n The remaining figure swam closer to her.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she heard in her transceiver, and that was it. \u201cNow we\u2019re even.\u201d\n Later, hard to say how much, she suddenly felt sand beneath her fins, and the next wave threw her ashore. There was no one else.\n Mariana gasped and tore off her mask. She hungrily took in a breath of fresh cold air. Then she looked at the raging skies and around the shore, where she saw no artificial lights. She had no idea where she was.\n She\u2019d get rid of the suit. She would start walking. She\u2019d try to make it somewhere dry without collapsing. If anyone asked, she\u2019d make some excuse of getting lost in the storm, and give a fake name. Only then would she go online, if possible, and try to find out what they did.\n Perhaps, just perhaps, she just emerged on the shore of a different world.\n Author\u2019s note: The quotations come from \u201cPoetry and Mystery of The Sea,\u201d as referred to by Edward Howland in \u201cOcean\u2019s Story; or Triumphs of Thirty Centuries\u201d (1873).\n Julie Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1 is a scientist, educator and award-winning Czech author, editor and translator of science fiction, fantasy and detective stories.

As you may know, I sometimes struggle with something to say in this column and have extended an open invitation for suggestions. Andrea took the call to heart and promised to send me a few ideas. She actually followed through on that threat and we\u2019ve since exchanged several emails.\nSome of the suggestions were behind-the-scenes-focused and would cause me to elaborate on or take a new look at subjects I\u2019ve spoken about here before. It certainly fits my interests. I enjoy the data-oriented editorials I\u2019ve done over the years and revisiting some of those topics with more recent data could yield some interesting results. Several of those editorials spun off from my own personal research to understand what it is that causes me to select the stories that I do. I still don\u2019t have a satisfactory answer to that question, and perhaps I never will, but it might help me get closer and provide insights into the market as it stands.\nI might also take a step back and rethink some of those from the perspective of the anthologies I\u2019ve worked on, particularly the three volumes of The Best Science Fiction of the Year series. In a sense, the same rules should apply, but I\u2019m selecting for a different audience and from a pool of works filtered through a number of other editors and publishers. There\u2019s also room to look at this from the perspective of overlap with other year\u2019s best editors and even the awards, which seem to be paying less and less attention to works originating in print\u2014despite still publishing some amazing works. There\u2019s a lot there to pull apart and think about.\nOf course, there were some other topics like superheros\u2014which I don\u2019t recall ever having written about in these columns\u2014that might be fun to have a go at because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m approaching them in the traditional sense. To me these \u201csupers\u201d are just stories about good (or bad) mutants, gadgeteers, scientists, aliens, etc. The hero or villain aspect is secondary. Some drift fantasy, some hard SF, and others blur that line normally forced between. I\u2019ll certainly have to give that some more thought. Feel free to add your two cents in the comments section on the website.\nSo, it looks like I have a few ideas moving forward and a big thank you to Andrea for that. Of course, there\u2019s always room for more. I have to write twelve of these things every year and I expect to be doing this for a long time. If you want to email me some suggestions, please feel free at neil@clarkesworldmagazine.com or in-person at a convention sometime\u2014Readercon and Worldcon are coming up next. You might even find yourself unexpectedly written into one of these things.\nAnd speaking of what\u2019s coming, I have two anthologies that will be published in July! Clarkesworld Year Nine: Volume Two should land on shelves today and close out the Year Nine volumes\u2014that\u2019s all the original fiction from our ninth year of publication. It\u2019s a great way to catch up or revisit the good old days. Just a bit later in the month, The Final Frontier will be published by Night Shade Books in print, ebook, and audio editions. Publishers Weekly recently gave it a starred review, so I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s a good sign. I\u2019m very excited to see both of these projects finally published and I hope you buy and enjoy them. [I\u2019m a full-time editor now, so of course I\u2019m going to encourage you to buy them. I sort of have to.]\nThat\u2019s all for this month. I hope to see some of you at Readercon in Massachusetts. Yes, that Readercon. The same place I nearly died at six years ago, well, new hotel, different town, further from the hospital (sigh).

Brown in 2009. Born in Oakland, California, she has a degree in literature from San Francisco State University and studied editing with Editcetera in Berkeley before joining the magazine. She runs the SF Awards Weekend in Seattle, serves on various awards juries, and has published several titles for the Locus Press imprint. Trombi also serves as Board President of the Locus Science Fiction Foundation. She has won four Hugo Awards for Best Semiprozine (2005-7, 2012) for her work at Locus and was a finalist the four interceding years.\nShe still lives in Oakland, with her two young daughters.\nI first met Liza in San Antonio, Texas during the 71st WorldCon. We were on a panel called \u201cWhat Makes a Review Great?\u201d, in which I discovered how persuasive Liza can be, and after the panel we got to talking. The conversation continued at the Locus table in the dealer\u2019s room, and then via email. A few months later I found myself taking over the Locus roundtable blog.\nYou\u2019ve mentioned you\u2019ve always been a hardcore science fiction reader. Where did that passion come from?\nIt\u2019s a pretty familiar path, I\u2019d say, where you\u2019re in fourth or fifth grade and you start reading mythology. I remember reading a lot of non-fiction about poltergeists, hauntings, different mythologies. In sixth grade I was talking about books with one of my friends\u2014it was actually Abi Sutherland, who now moderates Making Light\u2014and she said to me, \u201cHave you ever read Lloyd Alexander?\u201d I hadn\u2019t. I read it and said, \u201cOkay, now what?\u201d She pointed me to Anne McCaffrey, and there was no turning back.\nA year or two later, my mother\u2019s boyfriend, who had owned a bookstore, still had all of his stripped paperbacks, copies that hadn\u2019t sold and which were supposed to be destroyed. Anyway, he asked if I wanted any of them, and he had a lot of them. And I said, \u201cI want the whole science fiction and fantasy section!\u201d So I got maybe ten or twelve boxes of stripped books that were all sf/f\u2014a miraculous event in the life of a twelve year old who was kind of shy and was having trouble with her peers.\nIt was a great way to find things, because as a young adult you spend a lot of time asking people, \u201cWho\u2019s the next author I\u2019m supposed to read through?\u201d I did my stint with Larry Niven and with Isaac Asimov, tried Robert Forward, read Heinlein and others, and got stuck happily in the field. Though today I still read some fantasy, my heart belongs to science fiction. At least my twelve-year-old heart does! My forty-four-year-old heart is trying to have more breadth\u2014while being careful not to suffer palpitations.\nWhat was it like to become Editor-in-Chief of Locus in 2009? Had you and Charles N. Brown created a transition plan?\nBy 2006, I was in place to take over when he retired. In the past he had had several people lined up in this position previously, but in his heart of hearts he wanted to be the only one that could put out Locus. It was his baby. But by the time I got there he was ready to not be carrying such a workload. I wrote editorials with him, we went through books together, looked at reviews, and I would go to all of his meetings at conventions; I was also doing interviews.\nThe biggest and scariest part of the transition is that he had this incredible institutional knowledge from not only having a nearly photographic memory, specifically for text, but because he\u2019d grown up in the Golden Age (he was born in 1934) and lived through that period where you could read everything that came out. By the 2000s he had said, \u201cThere\u2019s no way anybody can read all of this,\u201d and he was leaning on reviewers more and doing his best to keep up.\nAs far as whether or not there was actually a path toward me taking over . . . . I had done the bookkeeping for the business for a long time, so I understood the financial ins and outs. I was making decisions with him about things. We were together for five days a week for seven years. There was certainly a lot of education through exposure. And he would say, \u201cWell you decide, you\u2019re taking over the magazine.\u201d Sometimes it was sort of a sideways version of teaching someone how to take over. It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cHere, now you will learn this thing and you will know it forever.\u201d I was flexible. I was very happy. He and I got along really well. We agreed on a lot of stuff. We disagreed vehemently about other things but it didn\u2019t get in the way.\nWhen it actually happened, it was shocking. There was a phone call at eleven o\u2019clock at night, and then there was going into work the next day having not slept at all, having spent all night having physical panic attacks. Trying to figure out all of these things, and coming up with a strategy for releasing the news in a way that felt respectful and appropriate to all the friends he had.\nAnd then there was just doing it without him. Not having his giant brain around was challenging. Somebody\u2019s name would pop up in the news, and he\u2019d be like, \u201cOh yeah, that guy. He started five different publishing companies in the fifties.\u201d We don\u2019t have that incredible institutional knowledge on tap anymore. So the change was hard. But he had named me as Editor-in-Chief upon his passing, so there was no confusion about how things were meant to move forward. That helped.\nSince taking over the Locus reins, what\u2019s been the greatest challenge? And your most rewarding experience working on the magazine?\nI think the greatest challenge is the same thing that would have happened if Charles Brown were still here, which is how to deal with electronic publishing\u2014only that it was accelerated by the economics of the time. Pre the 2008-2010 downturn, publishers were advertising, sending print galleys, people were excited, there was a lot of support for authors. Then the economic downturn came and advertising budgets got shut down.\nDigital publishing, which was poised to have a boom already, was really pushed into it with a sudden new excitement and growth. It seemed like it was essentially free in ways that print publishing hadn\u2019t been. Why send out physical galleys when they could be sending out digital galleys, for example? Of course, you know, comes time enough you realize it\u2019s not actually free\u2014the work is all still there, the only part you\u2019re not being charged for is paper and shipping.\nKeeping track of everything is also challenging. I have one publisher that sends print galleys every week, just like they always did. That\u2019s great: I can see every galley, send them out to reviewers. Then I get a hard copy, I can list it, put it on the recommended shelf for the end of the year. But other people are sending me PDFs, or solicitation emails asking whether I\u2019d like a review copy. When we get eighty to a hundred emails an hour during business hours, we just can't answer them all, and we don\u2019t read half of them if they\u2019re just publicity releases.\nBeing in the magazine business right now is also hard. Charles would say, \u201cWhen I die, you can sell all the books, and you guys can take the money and go do whatever.\u201d I don\u2019t think he thought Locus would keep going. He wanted it to, but I don\u2019t know that he thought it could.\nIn terms of rewarding experiences, we all love working here. It\u2019s kind of a fantastic job! We get to see the books, meet the authors, hang out with people, go to conventions. Everyone I work with is very smart and loves what we\u2019re doing.\nCongratulations on the 2012 Hugo for Best Semiprozine. How did that feel?\nWe hadn\u2019t won for several years before that, and really for me it felt like our post-Charles recognition. That was really important to me. People had been saying, \u201cLocus just wins because Locus wins.\u201d I mean, we have a lot of rockets, so I can understand that. After that win, rules were changed to get us off the slate. Now I think officially we\u2019re pretty much ineligible for any award [laughs]. Anyway, it\u2019s a beautiful Hugo; it\u2019s the glass-and-steel winged one.\nInterviews published in Locus follow a unique format, omitting questions and giving us just the interviewee\u2019s thoughts. How did that come about?\nThat\u2019s a really good question. I don\u2019t know why Charles shifted to that format. It\u2019s been that way for years and years. It could have been laziness on Charles\u2019 part, that he didn\u2019t like to prep questions formally. What we do is sit down and have a conversation with people. We just talk. And at the end of the conversation our transcriptionist writes out the whole thing longhand, and we strip ourselves out and put it all together.\nI always have two recorders going, by the way, because it\u2019s very hard to reproduce an interview. And it\u2019s completely disheartening if you realize you\u2019re going to have to ask all those questions again! Though one time we were talking to Charlie Stross in San Francisco for forty-five minutes and decided to take a small break (we usually talk for a little over an hour). We were in a hotel lobby. I looked at the recorder and the light was on, as it should have been\u2014but the pause switch had been turned on. When we got back I said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but apparently we weren\u2019t recording.\u201d And he said it all again in about ten minutes, speaking really quickly. Only Charlie Stross could do that. It was amazing. I was very relieved. So I\u2019ve learned that a little paranoia goes a long way.\nThat would be a great editor\u2019s motto.\nRight? I usually go in with a pretty good idea of some things I want to talk about. Obviously, if someone has a new book, we want to cover that. If they\u2019re a new author we want to talk about their entry into the field. But the format gives a lot of flexibility and freedom to talk about whatever actually becomes interesting in a conversation. Sometimes the conversation is amazing and goes places you never thought it would have.\nThe hardest interview I ever did, I actually said to the author, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to give me longer answers.\u201d Because I was getting these ten-word sentence answers from him. He was a really nice guy, a brilliant author, just uncomfortable in the interview. But then he hit this one thing, and he just kind of went\u2014he was energized, started talking very quickly. After that he shut back down. When we were done Charles and I looked at each other and said, \u201cOh, that\u2019s going to be a rough one.\u201d But on paper, it\u2019s actually one of the most interesting interviews we\u2019ve done! Other conversations are fascinating and lovely in person, but then on paper they\u2019re . . . light. You wish you could transmit the patter and the beats that happened, but we take the beats out, so you don\u2019t get that.\nWhat you also never have is \u201cintruding interviewer-itis,\u201d where the interviewer has more to say than the interviewee. Or the interviewer is trying to be clever and the author clearly gets irritated.\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t think the reader cares what I ask. They want to hear from the author. If we can turn twenty pages of interview manuscript into three pages of interview, then that\u2019s a win for the reader. Better that than ten questions with twenty-five to fifty word answers, and then a rote \u201cThank you, it was a pleasure\u201d at the end.\nThank you, it was a pleasure.[Laughs]\nCan you walk us through a day at Locus? Is there such a thing as a typical day?\nThere are different versions of days at Locus. Usually there\u2019s somebody that\u2019s scouring for news, and somebody else is going through emails. We also get buckets of mail from the post office, probably twenty to fifty physical books and ARCs a day. We get over two hundred titles that we list a month, and that doesn\u2019t include galleys. We\u2019re getting a lot of self-published stuff right now, but unless we have some prior knowledge about an author or there\u2019s some other reason to pay attention to their self-published work, it really has to stand out or we don\u2019t read it. Reading a self-published book turns us into slush readers, which we can\u2019t be. There's just not enough time.\nThere\u2019s also a lot of questions. I probably get asked a question every three to five minutes. And then, depending on when we are, we\u2019re asking, \u201cDo we have columns from this person?\u201d or \u201cDid we get these photos?\u201d or news is going up on the website or people are laying out the magazine. It\u2019s kind of wacky! We\u2019re up in the hills in Oakland, in a no-shoes office. It\u2019s casual, and people usually joke around in the morning. Closer to deadline we order lunch and all eat in together. It\u2019s fairly collegial and happy\u2014when not stressed.\nBack in 2009 you mentioned plans to run Charles\u2019 huge SF collection as a private library. What\u2019s the current state on that?\nWe were hoping that when the economic problems of 2009 ended, advertisers would come back. But they didn\u2019t. I mean, we still have some, and rely on that\u2014it\u2019s useful for them and great for us\u2014but advertisers that use to advertise once a month now do it three times a year instead of twelve, and so on. So a lot of the efforts I\u2019d hoped to put into creating a private library out of Charles\u2019 collection for academics and researchers have ended up being redirected into keeping the magazine going. We\u2019re doing a bit of restructuring this year, and we\u2019ll be pushing for more donations.\nWe ran a Kickstarter in 2012 and got money for the preservation of archival material, forty thousand photos and letters and index cards typed by famous authors that you wish you had met. As part of the Kickstarter we had put in a stretch goal to catalog Charles\u2019 collection, because I don\u2019t have an accurate catalog of what we have on site. We have some thirty thousand volumes, but we don\u2019t know exactly what we have. If you asked me, \u201cDo you have this?\u201d, I could hazard a guess but I wouldn\u2019t be sure.\nA proper catalog would be the first step towards a private library. I would love to do it. We had a plan to open it for research by appointment. I have other shelved ideas. Like a writer-in-residence program, because this is a house. People could come and live here for a month or two. Write while living at Locus. It would be cool!\nRecently two auctions of items from the collection of Charles N. Brown were held to benefit Locus. How did they go? Are you considering more auctions in the future?\nIt was fine. Charles was an avid collector of stuff. He collected pottery and baskets and masks and statuettes. Everywhere he went he grabbed stuff, and he didn\u2019t really care if it was a real antique or not. So we have all this stuff, which makes this a wonderful environment to work in, but it isn\u2019t helping our mission. So we decided to call in an auction house to sell some of it off.\nThey came in and were very enthusiastic. We thought, \u201cThis is going to be great!\u201d The next time they came they were a little less enthusiastic. In the end they didn\u2019t actually take that much stuff. We made some money, which was nice, but Locus costs a lot a money to produce per month. I\u2019d say that from the auctions we probably made a week and a half\u2019s worth or running Locus. And I don\u2019t have to worry about having 500 BCE ceremonial urns on the shelves anymore. At some point I think it\u2019s going to be the right move to not be in this house anymore\u2014as lovely as it is here\u2014but to move to a proper commercial space.\nThe other auction was for his mystery novels. He also collected sea stories and historical fiction. We\u2019ll probably sell those off too, because having that stuff is nice but doesn\u2019t help us. The money would. But auctions aren\u2019t a revenue stream. That\u2019s what I\u2019m more focused on right now, revenue streams.\nAny plans for the magazine that you can share?\nRight now we\u2019re prospecting for new reviewers. I\u2019m hoping that by next year we\u2019ll have a dedicated young-adult column and potentially better coverage of epic fantasy.\nThere\u2019s going to be some revamping on the website. Possibly a move to make a lot more content available. The plan isn\u2019t fully fleshed out, but I\u2019m excited by the idea of having the website match the actual magazine content more closely. The content might be behind a New York Times-style pay-wall, where you can read a number of articles and are then reminded that you\u2019re not a subscriber. I think it would be a really good thing for us, because we have a ton of content, and too many people think that Locus is the website. It\u2019s hard to explain to them that we\u2019re not, unless they\u2019re looking at the print magazine. So it would help to ameliorate that differential.\nBut, you know, there are always plans. In 2009 I was going to make a private library!\nHow do you spend your time when you\u2019re not working on Locus?\nMostly I\u2019m with my kids. I have two daughters, who are five and seven. When not with them, I like to swing dance. I started doing it a couple of years ago, and it\u2019s good for me. It\u2019s exercise and it\u2019s social, and nobody knows who I am [laughs].\nAlvaro is the co-author, with Robert Silverberg, of When the Blue Shift Comes, which received a starred review from Library Journal.

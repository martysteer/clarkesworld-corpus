The moon doesn't look like she was told it should look. It is not \u201cpurely white, as spotless and serene as a newly peeled egg.\u201d\nShe wants to scrub the moon clean, to fill in the craters, to fix it.\n\u201c \u2018It\u2019s too far away for mending,\u2019 \u201d Melinda\u2019s mother tells her.\n\u201c \u2018I want to anyway. I\u2019m going to. Will you help me?\u2019 \u201d Melinda responds.\nIf you never meet Melinda again, you will still know her well\u2014the first three pages of Mending the Moon make sure of that. If she fixes the moon, you will cheer her. If she is murdered, you will mourn her.\nThis is what Palwick does\u2014she gives us a character to love and she takes that character away and in the process she thrusts us into the lives of the characters who also loved the deceased. There is death, but there is a beautiful sense of community, too, even when the mourners don\u2019t necessarily get along. There is loss, but connection. In other words, Palwick gives us a family.\nWhy, if so much of Susan Palwick\u2019s fiction is about grief and loss, does it seem like such a gift to read it?\n\u201cI try to write clearly,\u201d said Palwick of her writing style. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in confusing readers unnecessarily, although I suppose I do sometimes anyway! I\u2019m very interested in poetics and prose rhythm, although there\u2019s much less of that in Mending than in The Necessary Beggar. I guess the style I aim for is \u2018sophisticated transparence,\u2019 if there is such a thing.\u201d\nPalwick doesn\u2019t publish a lot of fiction. By her own account, she writes slowly, edits heavily, and has a bad habit of starting drafts without finishing them. She made her first professional sale (to Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine) in 1985. She has one collection of stories, The Fate of Mice, and four novels, including, Flying in Place, The Necessary Beggar, Shelter, and Mending the Moon. Her first and most recent novels were published twenty years apart, give or take a year.\nPalwick is a speculative fiction writer, a columnist, licensed lay preacher, and an associate professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno. Below, Palwick and I talk about writing and life and a few other things here and there.\nIn what ways is writing a gift\u2014to you, to readers, etc.\u2014and in what ways does writing require faith\u2014in yourself, in the craft, in God?\nIt\u2019s certainly a gift to me, although it\u2019s one I\u2019ve worked very hard to develop. I think sometimes people think that \u201cgifts\u201d are presented on platters, rather than representing a lot of sweat and study. Writing\u2019s a gift, but it\u2019s also a discipline; maybe the gift is the desire to do it, while discipline is what confers the ability to do it well. But it\u2019s a gift because it gives me a way to speak to people I\u2019ll never meet, and because my characters (well, most of them, anyway) become friends I worry about, people whose stories I want to learn and follow. I don\u2019t think readers can be curious about a character\u2019s story if the writer isn\u2019t curious, too.\nIn any case, I certainly hope my writing is a gift to my readers. Some readers feel that way and some don\u2019t, and some feel that way about some of my books but not others. Writers are a little like eccentric relatives with hit-or-miss taste in Christmas gifts. One year they\u2019ll bake you the most delicious cookies you\u2019ve ever tasted, and the next year you\u2019ll open the box to find a pair of socks, handknit in colors never found in nature, that don\u2019t seem designed to fit human feet.\nAs far as faith goes . . . well, I think you have to have faith in your own ability to put a sentence together, and to tell a story other people want to hear. That doesn\u2019t come right away, and it can vanish pretty easily. I think we all second-guess ourselves and our work. My most trusted first reader is my husband, who\u2019s always honest and who has an uncanny ability to predict what other people will or won\u2019t like; if he says a story won\u2019t sell, it doesn\u2019t, even if I love it. But conversely, if he says a story\u2019s good, I\u2019ve learned to believe him, even if I\u2019m unhappy with the piece.\nI do have faith in my ability to craft readable, engaging prose. I think I\u2019m a pretty good stylist. I have faith in my characterization, too. That\u2019s what interests me most about fiction, and it\u2019s where many of my stories start, and I\u2019ve gotten enough positive feedback to know that other people see it as one of my strengths. (I agree with my critics that plot is my weakness.)\nAs for how writing connects with my religious faith, I firmly share the belief\u2014best articulated by J.R.R. Tolkien in \u201cOn Fairy-stories\u201d and by Dorothy Sayers in Mind of the Maker\u2014that humans were created by a Creator to create. Any act of making things, rather than destroying them, is holy work, whether one\u2019s making books or bread.\nWhere did you start Mending the Moon?\nI started Mending the Moon because Tor told my agent they\u2019d like me to write a mainstream novel, and my agent\u2014who never pressures me\u2014said, \u201cThey came to us, and that doesn\u2019t happen in this market, and you will get me a proposal in a week.\u201d She and I kicked some ideas around over dinner, and I got her the proposal, and they accepted it. That meant, of course, that I had to write the book.\nI\u2019d written a not-very-good draft of a novella about three older women trying to help a young man through a supernatural crisis, so I took those characters and made them mainstream. Most of my work is somehow about loss or grief, so it\u2019s no surprise that Mending the Moon is, too. I\u2019ve always been interested in how people navigate their lives after tragedy. In Mending the Moon, that factor was heightened because my father died three months before Tor approached my agent, and my mother died while I was writing the book, so I was living in the raw grief my characters inhabit (although my parents, both in their eighties, died of natural causes, not foul play).\nThis was the first book I wrote entirely in response to a publisher\u2019s request. I wrote Flying in Place and The Necessary Beggar without contracts (and I prefer to work that way, because there\u2019s much less pressure). I wrote Shelter under contract, but had already started it when I sold it. But all of my books have started, in one way or another, with character.\nHow does a novel work on the reader? What should it do? And in what ways does Mending the Moon succeed or veer from that?\nIt depends on the novel. It depends on the reader. No novel will hit two different people exactly alike; it won\u2019t even be the same book if the same person goes back to it at different stages in life. Some books grievously disappoint on a later reading, especially if we loved them in childhood. Others withstand the test of two or three re-readings. The best books are inexhaustible. You can reread them endlessly, and they always show you something new. The Lord of the Rings does that for me; so does The Last Unicorn. I have no idea if Mending the Moon will do that for anyone, although I certainly hope so. I\u2019ve already been told by a friend that the book helped her through a time of grief, which moves me very much.\nI do think\u2014and this is a somewhat didactic stance, and decidedly a minority opinion\u2014that the work of all good fiction is to increase the amount of imaginative empathy in the world, to take us into experiences we haven\u2019t had firsthand and show us new opportunities for compassion. Several other writers, people I respect deeply, have made rather loud fun of me for saying this, but I really believe it: not, necessarily, that all books have to do this, but that books that do are the ones people will still be reading after the author\u2019s dead. I hope that Mending the Moon does this in even a small way, in showing a response to violence that isn\u2019t vengeful or obsessed with police procedure, and particularly in attempting to represent the experience of a murderer\u2019s family.\nIn what ways did the writing of Mending the Moon challenge you as a writer? What were some of the surprises for you?\nWell, it challenged me because Tor asked for a mainstream novel, and I don\u2019t write mainstream. That just isn\u2019t how my writing brain works. I got around that problem by creating Comrade Cosmos, so while the book itself isn\u2019t genre, it\u2019s about genre, about how fandoms and popular culture help people negotiate real-world loss and horror.\nTechnically, it was a challenge because the narrative\u2019s so fragmented. I\u2019m very keenly aware of structure, and I decide what the structure of a book will be ahead of time; this helps me write it by providing a framework. Mending has three sections of seven chapters each; in each section, the second, fourth, and sixth chapters are about Comrade Cosmos (comic relief, literally!), while the others deal with the real-world narrative. Each of the real-world chapters, though, has five sections, of different lengths and in different orders from one chapter to the next, from the POV of five characters: Jeremy, Melinda (in flashback), Rosemary, Veronique, and Anna. Putting all this together became like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, especially since I cannibalized a previous version of the book to construct this one. So far, what\u2019s surrpised me most about reader response is that nobody\u2019s said the book feels scattered; readers seem to think it flows okay, which means the structure is doing its work and functioning quietly in the background.\nThematically, it was a challenge because the material\u2019s so emotionally difficult, and also because it\u2019s about seven months in the lives of a group of people who are all grieving very deeply. That early phase of grief tends, in my experience, to be fairly static. It wouldn\u2019t have been very interesting to have them all just sitting at home\u2014although Anna does a lot of that\u2014but car chases wouldn\u2019t have been realistic. So I had to balance paralysis with action, and I\u2019m still not sure how well it came off.\nI love your characters! Will you talk a little bit about where the characters in Mending the Moon came from? What inspired Melinda Soto, Jeremy, Veronique, Rosemary, and Henrietta? What goes into the character creation process?\nWell, I\u2019m a college English professor; I hope I\u2019m not too much like Veronique, but there are definite autobiographical echoes there (I gave her my own dissertation topic, for instance). I also volunteered for seven years as a lay chaplain in a local emergency room, work I loved and stopped doing only because the hospital was sold to a secular for-profit that axed the Spiritual Care Department. So that part of Rosemary\u2019s experience is very directly autobiographical. I wanted to give each of them a pre-existing problem that would be complicated and deepened by Melinda\u2019s death, which is where Veronique\u2019s career angst and Rosemary\u2019s husband\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s came from. As for Melinda and Jeremy, although I\u2019m childless by choice, I\u2019m fascinated by unusual family structures. That shows up in all of my novels, I think, especially Shelter. I\u2019m very interested in families created by forces other than biology.\nHen\u2019s an interesting case. People keep talking about her as if she\u2019s a major character, one of the POV characters, and she\u2019s not. She\u2019s there to facilitate movement and reconciliation, in various ways, among the other characters, which is one of the things good clergy do. I wanted her to be sympathetic, and I tried to make her realistic; she\u2019s a combination of various Episcopal priests I\u2019ve known. I wanted to write a book that showed church communities as groups of ordinary people, and that showed church functioning the way it really does, or can, in times of great pain: not as a source of answers, but as a focal point and gathering place.\nThe POV character people tend not to mention is Anna, which is ironic since her sections of the book are about being shunned as a result of her son\u2019s horrific crime and subsequent suicide. Anna\u2019s situation is very loosely based on that of someone I know. Loving someone whose terrible actions you don\u2019t understand, and who\u2019s being reviled by the rest of the world, is a very lonely place to be.\nHow do your experiences in academia and as a writer overlap, interact, and/or clash?\nThe university-writing-church triangle is interesting; they all feed each other, but the interactions can get gnarly. There\u2019s a fair amount of faith-bashing in the academy\u2014one of my grad students once said, \u201cSmart people don\u2019t go to church,\u201d and too many people believe that, especially if the church in question is a Christian one\u2014and the faith elements in my fiction have definitely alienated some readers. I completely understand why this happens; organized religion has a lot to answer for, and many people have been so deeply hurt by faith communities that they can\u2019t see anything but what they expect to see. This is definitely the land of confirmation bias. I know I\u2019ve done something right when people squint at me and say, \u201cYou\u2019re not like all those other Christians.\u201d My father, a raging atheist who reacted with horror to my midlife conversion, once said that I was someone who gave the church a good name. That\u2019s one of the highest compliments I\u2019ve ever gotten.\nAs an academic, I think and talk about writing and narrative a lot, which helps my own writing. On the other hand, I have very little time to read for pleasure, and grading student papers means that when I do have free time, the last thing I want to do is look at text. I get most of my narrative fix from audiobooks and TV, at this point. And like many academics, I do most of my own writing during summers and breaks.\nWhat\u2019s next for you?\nI have two new stories forthcoming, one currently scheduled to appear on Tor.com on July 10, and one in F&SF, which I hope will be out this autumn. My work in progress includes three (count \u2018em three) partial novels, with inception dates ranging from ten years ago to, uh, this morning. I\u2019m very good at starting things and much less good at finishing them. I\u2019m trying to be better about that part.\nJeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

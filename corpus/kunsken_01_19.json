Jupiter\u2019s yellow-orange planet-shine gave way to the white glare of the lander\u2019s spotlights and the scatter of light within cold jets blowing dust and pebbles and chunks of ice away. Even in the low gravity, the landing jarred, bouncing once, before they came to rest.\nHome. Kedija said the word experimentally in her head, but none of the feelings she associated with home responded to the word.\nThen, everyone was unclipping straps, listening to the ongoing verbal report of the piloting systems, double-checking suit seals, talking to each other with a hint of the hysteria she felt. Over eight months, they\u2019d crossed seven hundred million kilometers to reach Ganymede.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Petros said inanely.\nHe was standing, but had gone still, listening, peeking out the porthole. The lander shook as doors opened to the vacuum outside. He offered her a gloved hand. Having gravity again felt strange, but Ganymede\u2019s pull was similar to Luna\u2019s, so she still felt weightless, less than solid.\nKedija stepped down the ladder cautiously. Beneath her, some of her fellow refugees were stretching and waving their arms in the sudden freedom. Others stepped gingerly farther and farther across the pebbled ice, taking in their world. She set down her booted foot, insulated to survive the meager hundred kelvins. There was no magic feeling. No sense of destiny. Only an ongoing sense of dread.\nThey\u2019d landed beside Adapa Crater. Edge to edge it was almost sixty kilometers across, and on its heights, they would built conductor towers to generate electricity as Ganymede traveled through Jupiter\u2019s immense magnetic field. They were under the king of the planets, but looked south to see it, as they were two thirds of the way to Ganymede\u2019s pole.\nThe lander spotlights turned the unlit landscape much darker, and the chips in her head carrying her AI worked to compensate for contrast. Full sunlight at Ganymede would only ever be three percent what she\u2019d seen on Earth. And when the sun was behind Ganymede, Jupiter would shine down with a similar orangey dimness. Rows of hills and plains stretched into the distance, mostly the milky white of concrete-hard water ice, but veined with gray and black where meteorite activity had dropped minerals and metals onto the ice. Their new home was somber.\nSix more landers carrying Eritrean colonists had landed in a curving row beside her lander. Beyond them, following the line of the crater, were six more landers carrying Ethiopian colonists. This was a new Plymouth Rock, five hundred years after the first. Anxieties ebbed as they all began to work. They had a whole colony to build.\nThey had lots of robots, built in the aluminum fields of Luna, and they\u2019d been tested in the cold of the moon\u2019s two-week night, so they should have worked here. They all creaked more than they should have though, working almost reluctantly, cutting blocks of rock-hard ice out of the ground. They needed to build their ice houses over these new hollows, and heat and pressurize them to livable temperatures. The thick ice would protect them from the worst of Jupiter\u2019s radiation and eventually, they would grow gardens, make schools, build factories, homes, families.\nKedija finished another reboot and the robot finally showed only green telltales, before it rolled slowly across the surface on wire wheels, towing aluminum framing up the rise, where other colonists and robots were flattening the top of the crater lip to raise the first of the conducting towers.\nBlotches of bright purple stained her vision and she tried to blink the spots away. They weren\u2019t really in her eyes though. Splotchy purples and blues materialized in her vision whenever Jupiter was in sight, like the king of the planets was reminding them to pay attention. Their suits were heavy with layers of lead shielding, but the faceplates could take only so much lead before they couldn\u2019t see through them. At the wrong angles, the radiation got through and played with the electronic and mechanical implants in their bodies. They needed them to survive, but the radiation did funny things to the implants in their brains, and only so much noise could be filtered out.\n\u201cHey boss,\u201d Petros said on the open channel. \u201cI think you\u2019d better come see this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYou really have to come here,\u201d he said.\nPetros was leading a surveying team about two kilometers into the hills west of the lip of Adapa Crater. Her AI showed his position and mapped the easiest way to get there. A lot more robots were glitching and she wanted to get them moving, but she felt like she\u2019d been coaxing robotic movement for days.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said.\nA red light appeared in her ocular implant. Personal message. She took a breath. Then accepted the call.\n\u201cHello, Negasi,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI thought we said that we\u2019d share information, Kedija,\u201d he said. His breath was raspy, tired. He\u2019d been lifting something. But his tone was always hard.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what Petros wants, but I need a break,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFinding metals and not telling us?\u201d he said.\n\u201cCome if you want,\u201d she said, hoping he didn\u2019t. \u201cPetros is two klicks out. It\u2019s going to be a hike.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at west point two in ten,\u201d he said. Then his messaging status turned transparent.\nKedija headed to WP2. Petros better not have found metal and thought to keep it a secret.\nNegasi brought along three members of his contingent. She hadn\u2019t brought anyone. She didn\u2019t exactly feel in danger because of this. She hadn\u2019t felt safe since the start of the war. She hadn\u2019t felt safe in the camps. She hadn\u2019t felt safe training on Luna or on the way out to Jupiter. They didn\u2019t speak on the walk out to Petros. Maybe they were talking to each other on another channel her AI didn\u2019t know. A cold itch hovered over her spine.\nThe geology of Ganymede was stark, sterile, unwelcoming, but carried a hard, strange beauty. Many hills were thrown up in radial rings from Adapa Crater, but age had blunted their sharp edges with some of the western faces showing signs of erosion and melting. Against the black sky studded with cold stars, the effect was not unlovely. No other colony in the solar system would have these features. Mars, the moon, the asteroids all had different geologies. And none of them looked like home. Blotchy blue patches appeared in her vision. She turned away from the insistent glare of Jupiter. This was something they would all have to get used to.\nThe icy ground was uneven and covered with pebbles, sometimes deeply, which kept slowing them. This part of Ganymede didn\u2019t have real regolith, a deep mixture of particles and loose stone, but a layer of dust a few centimeters deep seems to have lain here for all time, only marked by the low gravity skip-hopping footsteps of Petros\u2019 party.\nThey rounded the last hill before coming into sight of Petros\u2019 group. A flat plain of dusted ice lay between them and the next row of hills. Petros\u2019 team was clustered into two groups with their hard white lights reflecting off the white of the ice of the hill they were examining.\nAs she and Negasi crossed the plain, Petros\u2019 hills occluded more of the stars, catching Jupiter\u2019s shine on its flatness. But the closer they got, the less like a hill it looked. The glaring headlamps shining showed a pitted rising surface far flatter and smoother than the other hills. Petros\u2019 team had gathered some measurements and their suit AIs shared with Kedija and Negasi. The flatness was very close to a plane, rising off the ground at sixty degrees. Impacts marked the hill as much as the rest of the surface of Ganymede. The AI analyzed the overlapping impacts, estimating an age above a million years. The AIs guessed that it was made of nearly pure water, with none of the ammonia, nitrates, sulfurs, and other organics and minerals that were part of the ground. Without the impurities, this ice would be far harder at this temperature.\n\u201cA pyramid?\u201d Negasi said.\nPetros turned, seeming surprised that the Ethiopian leader was here. Then he saw Kedija and approached.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole row of them,\u201d Petros said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t looked farther out, but . . . \u201d\nHis voice trailed off and they followed his sight line. Jupiter\u2019s shine at this angle was just enough to see that this ring was not hills at all. A curving line of flat-topped ice pyramids stood in a trough between two rows of impact hills. The pyramid faces turned relative to one another, always facing Adapa Crater. The distance softened the impact marks on their faces, and the flattened tops almost seemed natural.\n\u201cWe never saw them from orbit,\u201d Kedija said.\n\u201cSame size as the hills here,\u201d Petros said.\n\u201cEven the pyramids at Giza can\u2019t be seen from orbit without binoculars,\u201d Negasi said dismissively. \u201cWho made them?\u201d\nOne of Petros\u2019 team radioed from farther along the base of this pyramid. They headed that way. In some places, snow and dust had formed drifts and they stepped through, making expanding clouds. At eighty meters, about halfway across the base, two members of Petros\u2019 team stood at the edge of an opening, six meters tall and about the same wide. Dirty dust and snow lay in the opening, untouched for who knew how long.\n\u201cHoly . . . \u201d Kedija said, her voice trailing off.\n\u201cSomething, some aliens, lived here?\u201d Negasi said. \u201cThey left tombs.\u201d\n\u201cBut the AIs think they\u2019re millions of years old,\u201d Petros said.\nThe opening yawned around them. Kedija\u2019s AI autofocused her headlamp. The ceiling began at six meters and as they moved inward, it followed the outer slope, out of the reach of light. The walls reflected the light brightly, even where sublimation hollows pitted them and where patches of white hoarfrost furred them. The floor was smooth and took their footprints in the snow and dust as the way yawned open to a silent darkness. The pyramid was hollow.\nAlthough their lamps couldn\u2019t do more than suggest the ceiling with scintillating reflections, the nearby walls showed curving pilasters reaching high into the darkness like white ribs. Kedija neared one. All along the wall, closely-spaced shelves of ice projected about fifty centimeters into the pyramid interior, with only a few centimeters separating one from the next layer. There was nothing on them. Just more snow and dust.\n\u201cThey\u2019re set up like radiator vanes,\u201d Kedija said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no heat to radiate.\u201d\n\u201cWould that wick away any heat?\u201d Petros said. \u201cKeep the pyramid colder and more solid?\u201d\n\u201cWhen we tell Earth or Mars about this we\u2019ll be rich,\u201d Negasi said, shining is light up the wall, his grin visible even behind his faceplate.\n\u201cIf they find out there\u2019s an alien tomb here, they\u2019ll take Ganymede from us,\u201d Kedija said. \u201cThen where will we go?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see them try to live here,\u201d he said, but she noticed he didn\u2019t dispute her point.\n\u201cWhere are the crypts?\u201d Kedija said.\nShe swept her light onto the floor. Then she stilled and screamed. Lights swiveled to hers, flashing to scan the dark. The figure was gone.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Petros said.\n\u201cA thing was there,\u201d she said. \u201cJust there. Like a centipede. Big.\u201d\nNegasi panned his light further, finding nothing but flat floor and the occasional low mound of snow. One of Negasi\u2019s companions knelt at the spot where Kedija had been shining her light. They looked close and in their local web her AI picked up their readings. No thermal. No sonic. No anything. Petros slid a gloved finger along the dust, leaving a trail of of exposed ice.\n\u201cThis dust hasn\u2019t been disturbed for . . . \u201d Petros said, pausing, looking for something they could understand.\n\u201cHe means there was nothing here, Kedija,\u201d Negasi said. \u201cGo back to base.\u201d\nShe took a deep breath. The oval of her lamplight found nothing else. Just emptiness and flat floor.\n\u201cAhya!\u201d Negasi swore, stumbling backwards.\nKedija braced his shoulders before he fell. Her AI swiveled her lamp at the ground. For an instant, she saw a black carapace, a wormlike figure on many legs. She couldn\u2019t tell if it was facing toward or away from them. At each end, the shiny shell bloated like a head, and there was another bulge over its midsection. And in the instant before it vanished, she realized it was transparent. The fine striations in the dust had been visible through it. Negasi marched forward angrily, kicking the dust where it had been. Then, at the extreme edge of their lamplights, more outlines showed in the shadows. More of the creatures.\n\u201cLet\u2019s get help,\u201d Kedija said, pulling Petros back. Negasi and his people didn\u2019t argue.\nKedija and Negasi agreed that neither would report what they\u2019d found to Earth or Mars. It took them a day to organize themselves to go back with enough equipment and lighting to make a real examination of the first pyramid. Most of the colonists were so busy setting up the robots that it was difficult to find help to load the equipment onto the rovers, one of which needed to be assembled. After hefting a generator onto the flatbed of one of the rovers instead of waiting for a lift to be available, Kedija was winded, and took a moment to rest.\nJupiter hung above them, smooth as a marble, hazy with layers of browned orange and beige jet streams of ammonium hydrosulfide, shot with milky highlights of ammonia. And where the ammonium layers thinned, patches of blue from lower cloud decks peeked through.\nThey would know those clouds in a few months, when they managed to get the industrial dirigibles into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere to harvest helium-3. A century of mining the Earth\u2019s moon was beginning to leave the fusion reactors of Earth hungering. Their new home had been financed on the condition that the refugees mine Jupiter\u2019s helium-3. It wasn\u2019t a deal with the devil. It was work. But it meant the only place they could belong was out here.\nBlotchy purple impinged on her vision again, radiation that her implants and suit couldn\u2019t screen out. The king of the gods didn\u2019t suffer mortals to watch him for long. She blinked and looked away. The patches of nonsensical color remained, ghosts of damage she was taking. She was taking eight rems every day, but her DNA repair genes were engineered to hyperactivity so that she could endure. They would all endure.\nThey finally entered the same pyramid as yesterday, Hamid and Petros driving the rovers right in, lights blazing. The empty majesty of the pyramid rose above them. In the faint gravity only light curving ribs were needed to support the weight of big ice blocks. The pyramids were smooth and seamed and obviously constructed. The odd, closely-spaced shelves she\u2019d noticed yesterday on the walls went all the way to the peak, making them impractical as shelves and much more likely to be vents.\n\u201cThe rems are way down in here,\u201d Petros said.\nKedija\u2019s AI offered the radiation count. Depending on whether she was looking at the doorway or not, the radiation was down to millirems, still hundreds of times Earth normal at sea level, but safe enough to live a long time. When they were finished building them, their habitats would be as safe.\n\u201cNone of our visitors are here,\u201d Kedija said.\n\u201cToo soon,\u201d Negasi said, but when she followed his pointed hand, there was nothing there.\n\u201cI\u2019m setting up the cameras,\u201d Petros said.\nIn her peripheral vision, a dark shape, long and shiny, appeared and then vanished as soon as her eye darted to it. Hamid turned quickly, in the other direction, but there was nothing there.\n\u201cGhosts,\u201d Hamid said.\nNo one answered him. Kedija thought she was hearing his heavy breathing in her headphones, but her own faceplate began fogging and she forced herself to be calm.\n\u201cFilming,\u201d Petros said. He\u2019d set up some standard rover cameras on stands, four of them, covering a complete circle.\nOne of the big centipede things appeared about five meters away. It didn\u2019t vanish as soon as she looked at it. Its many legs were still, and the light from Petros\u2019 lamps glinted off what looked like a hard black carapace that fit in overlapping segments.\n\u201cAre you getting this, Petros?\u201d she said. The thing vanished.\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he said, but he wasn\u2019t looking her way. One of the black creatures was before him, only a few meters away. \u201cIt\u2019s casting no shadow,\u201d he whispered. And it was mostly true. There was no shadow behind it, but from her angle, Kedija saw a faint blueing of the light onto the icy white floor. Then, it too vanished.\nPetros turned to his cameras, connecting them to his AI. Another centipede, a good meter and a half long appeared right behind him.\n\u201cLook out, Petros!\u201d she said.\nHe spun and miscalculated the force needed and his momentum flung him off the floor, falling over the centipede. His foot passed immaterially through it before it vanished too. Kedija helped him up and checked his suit for damage.\n\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re projections,\u201d Kedija said.\n\u201cWhere are the projectors?\u201d Negasi asked.\nIt was a good question. So far they\u2019d found nothing that looked like wiring, found no magnetic fields that might be a sign that current was flowing anywhere. And what power source would still be good after a million years?\n\u201cLook,\u201d she said, pointing. Nearer to the corner. Two of the meter-long centipedes were still in an area less covered by spotlights. But enough light reached them to see that there was something strange. One was standing before the other and the proportions seemed odd, the little light reflecting back strangely, distorted. No. One wasn\u2019t standing in front of the other. One was standing within the other, like two ghosts. And where they overlapped, a pattern of light and dark wove itself over them, like seeing them through waves in water.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to them?\u201d Kedija said.\nThe centipedes vanished. No more of the centipedes appeared.\n\u201cGhosts,\u201d Hamid said again.\nGhosts. Her mind drifted, like she couldn\u2019t process properly. Ganymede was almost all ice, but so hard that to them it felt rocklike. But on geological scales, parts of the ice were softer. Some of the highest crater walls of the biggest craters eventually just collapsed. They were called ghost craters. But if these pyramids had been here millions of years, why haven\u2019t their ghosts vanished too?\nThe hut was pretty cold. Huge blocks of ice had been lasered and sawed out of the ice, leaving a hole ten meters deep. The blocks had been cut into thick sections and water-welded together in a kind of square igloo structure. Then, they\u2019d inflated a habitat within the hollow and brought in their equipment and stores before installing the airlock. It would take days for the heaters to get it to comfortable temperatures, but it was almost up to zero Celsius. It felt good to get her helmet off.\nFatimah was helping Petros with the display settings and analysis of his camera readings. Fatimah\u2019s hair was short, freshly-shaved, like Kedija\u2019s, the easiest way to have hair when wearing a space suit every day. The external plates holding Fatimah\u2019s AI could do with a polish and her dark eyes shone with the internal light of an ocular display. Kedija rubbed her eyes. In here, they were blessedly protected from most of Jupiter\u2019s radiation and neither Jovian psychedelic blotches nor oversized centipede projections intruded. She blew on her fingers.\n\u201cNegasi doesn\u2019t want to come over here to help with this?\u201d Petros said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want him here,\u201d Kedija said. \u201cThey have their habitats and we\u2019ll have ours.\u201d\nShe looked over Fatimah\u2019s shoulder at the screen. Fatimah was trying to clean up the still images of the two centipedes overlapping.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as ghosts,\u201d Kedija said. \u201cThose are interference patterns.\u201d\nThe odd watery lighting between them was a classic interference pattern. But holograms or 3-D projections wouldn\u2019t interfere like that, not in a way they could see macroscopically. Hamid suddenly cried out and pointed at the wall behind her. They all turned and she glimpsed a large shape on the wall before it vanished.\n\u201cSame?\u201d Kedija asked.\n\u201cThis place is haunted!\u201d Hamid insisted.\nPetros examined the wall with a UV lamp.\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019re quantum possibilities,\u201d Kedija said.\nPetros looked back at her, the UV fluorescing on the wall behind his head giving him a halo.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen conscious beings observe quantum probabilities, they collapse into something normal, before we\u2019d ever really see them.\u201d\nBlue fluorescing light from the wall reflected off the edges of the plates on his forehead. His AI, like hers, was more than just an external processor. They shared thoughts with the AI and the AI shared thoughts and observations back. As their radiation resistance made them not exactly human anymore, so too did the AIs change the way they thought. They could do so much more with AIs, could think faster, but it made them lean on the helpers too. Kedija sometimes felt like she was managing her brain rather than inhabiting it, in a way that perhaps wasn\u2019t exactly human either.\n\u201cWhat if . . . \u201d she said.\nPetros shut off his UV lamp and looked at her like he was hoping she had a real explanation.\n\u201cWhat if we\u2019re not as conscious as we thought? This is new,\u201d she said haltingly, tapping the plate on her own forehead. \u201cA robot observing a quantum event doesn\u2019t necessarily collapse its wave function the way humans do.\u201d\nHe frowned. \u201cNo one has observed something like that with AI augments, boss.\u201d\nThe lights of the habitat blinked out. All the equipment stopped. Even the fans. Only the pale orange glow of the heating elements cast any light. Then wrist displays and AI plates shone light.\n\u201cGet the emergency power on!\u201d Kedija said.\nThe lights and everything else came on. The fans sounded loud after their brief absence.\n\u201cSomething not connected right?\u201d Kedija said.\nPetros frowned, looking at his wrist display, but his eyes glowed as his AI fed him a series of face displays on the inside of his eye. \u201cThe AIs think all the hardware is good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a random software failure. The signal to main power just stopped. The software took it as a sign to shut down.\u201d\nThat shouldn\u2019t have happened. Their software was well-tested and had redundancies. The spot on the wall where the centipede thing had appeared was still empty. What had it been doing all the way over here? They\u2019d just built the habitat in the last twenty-four hours. There were no projectors in it. And there were no ghosts. She moved close to Petros, whose expression was starting to look a bit alarmed as he probably chewed through the implications.\n\u201cIf these are quantum effects,\u201d she whispered, \u201ccould they be interfering with our systems?\u201d\nHis expression took on the wild-eyed intensity she\u2019d seen in so many faces, and in the mirror, after Asmera had been nuked, when they thought they\u2019d lost everything. They hadn\u2019t lost everything. They\u2019d had so much more to lose in the coming months and years.\n\u201cHow do we stop them from interfering with our systems?\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe came seven hundred million kilometers to find a home. We can\u2019t go back!\u201d\nPetros was on the edge of tears. Kedija hugged him.\n\u201cThis is our new home,\u201d she said in his ear, not understanding what those words meant anymore. They had no substance. \u201cThis is our home.\u201d\nKedija\u2019s first dreams in the new habitat were of cold, shivering, bone-numbing cold. But a thicket of other dream images threaded into that cold, like shoots of grass forcing their way through pavement cracks. The dream became brighter and brighter, until she was shielding her face with her arm. The flash passed and the shock wave followed, knocking down all the buildings in the outskirts of Asmera. She hadn\u2019t felt the heat. The wave of superheated air had passed over the brick wall laying over her.\nBut she was on Ganymede now, sitting in her sleeping bag, hugging herself and wiping sweat as her heart thumped hard in her chest, still feeling the weight of the building trapping her. The habitat had only warmed to one degree and the chill nipped at her sweat. Around her, people shifted in sleep. No images of huge alien centipedes showed themselves. They weren\u2019t ghosts.\nKedija knew about ghosts. She was already haunted.\nShe rubbed her eyes, trying to banish images of a nuclear strike but succeeded only in replacing them with something almost worse. They were crushed up against fences, hundreds of them, maybe thousands. She hadn\u2019t made it to the fence, but she could see through the heads and shoulders to the UN soldiers on the other side in hazmat suits and gas masks. The soldiers watching them through the glass of their faceplates, not raising their rifles, mute to the desperation of the survivors.\nEthiopia and Eritrea were uninhabitable because some colonel with the launch codes got twitchy. Once the nuclear exchange began, it ran down with deadly inevitability. Half of the warheads were of such poor quality that they achieved only partial detonation, which was almost worse, spreading raw unexploded plutonium over burned ground, irradiating both countries with fallout that made Fukushima, Chernobyl, and Tehran look like practice drills. The survivors gathered in the few low-radiation areas, but couldn\u2019t get out. No country would let them in. And the UN helped hold them where they were.\nMovement flickered on the wall beside her, at the edge of her vision. One of the transparent centipede ghosts clung to the wall.\nThe blue-brassarded soldiers wouldn\u2019t let the survivors beyond the fences to somewhere safe, but the international community was willing to pay to genetically-engineer them for radiation-resistance. None of them were human anymore; wrong number of chromosomes. But the survivors could walk across more of their blasted lands after that, like they were haunting it.\nOnly when Fusion Power Corp came was there any chance to leave. Fusion Power Corp needed helium-3 and their genetic modifications made them the only people on Earth who could survive the radiation on Ganymede. Countries didn\u2019t like paying to help the same refugees for years on end, so FPC\u2019s offer of employment was celebrated as the private sector exercising social responsibility. FPC got the Nansen Medal. The survivors, Eritreans and Ethiopians alike, were exorcised from humanity in excruciatingly slow Hohmann transfer orbits.\nOn her wrist, Negasi\u2019s name appeared on her incoming calls. The ghost beside her vanished.\n\u201cYou cut our damn power?\u201d Negasi said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she answered.\n\u201cI put up with you fucking Eritreans on the way to Jupiter, but I don\u2019t have to put up with you now,\u201d he said.\nKedija rose, shivering. Grumbling started in sleeping bags around her.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t cut your power, Negasi,\u201d she said more quietly. \u201cHave ghosts come to your habitat? I just had one here.\u201d\n\u201cGhosts don\u2019t interrupt life support power,\u201d he said.\nHer stomach sank. Life support problems? That was bad. They could survive radiation, but not minus one seventy, or a hard vacuum. She was missing something.\n\u201cA quantum ghost could mess up the probabilities in your control systems,\u201d she offered.\nIt sounded strange in her ears as she said it.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said.\nShe started putting on her survival suit.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the pyramids,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\u201cIf they\u2019re bugging up your life support, they won\u2019t be far from ours,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to figure this out.\u201d\nKedija and Petros scrunched out onto the ice to the entrance of the first pyramid. Jupiter the insouciant king hung still, timeless and stately above them. Ganymede showed only one face to Jupiter, which meant Jupiter never set and never moved. It made her feel like time had stopped.\nNegasi was waiting for them with a big man. She squawked in the radio band, the sound they used to replace a physical gesture of the head or face to greet someone. Instead of responding in kind, Negasi tapped his waist. A holster hung there.\n\u201cYou brought a gun to Ganymede?\u201d she said.\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget Adigrat,\u201d he said.\nAdigrat. That was his ghost. Her ghost, Asmera in Eritrea was the start of the war. Adigrat in Ethiopia was the last city on either side to die. Many had thought it safe. It had no military value and survivors had been streaming in for days. Kedija hadn\u2019t made the war. She\u2019d suffered it, like all of them. She wanted to leave it behind, but ghosts appear like time hasn\u2019t passed.\n\u201cThis is no trick, Negasi,\u201d she said, but in her ears, her words sounded exhausted, the exhaustion that could only start in the marrow.\nShe lead them into the pyramid. They\u2019d left some lights on to record, to try to understand where the projectors were, if there were projections. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d find any. Dozens of the transparent centipede ghosts stood, occasionally twitching or turning. Those that were close to one another occasionally appeared indistinct and watery, like an image seen through the surface of a burbling stream. Some of the ghosts began to disappear.\n\u201cThese might be quantum images,\u201d she said to Negasi. \u201cThey interfere with one another. They sometimes vanish when we observe them. They could be interacting with our microlevel systems.\u201d\nThere was just enough light to see Negasi\u2019s dubious expression behind the faceplate.\n\u201cWe have a quantum pest control problem?\u201d he said.\n\u201cNot a pest,\u201d she said, considering the vanishing centipedes. Others appeared elsewhere. She\u2019d set her AI to think about them, but making recordings was difficult, and her AI hadn\u2019t come to a conclusion as to whether they were all the same or different creatures.\n\u201cSomething built these tombs,\u201d she said. \u201cThey left something of themselves behind. Not writing. Interacting probabilities.\u201d\n\u201cThese are alien hieroglyphs?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about a memorial for an extinct species! We were almost extinct. We have to live. This is our turn!\u201d\nThis is our turn. The words pulled in her chest.\nNegasi was pointing at Petros, who looked uncomfortable. \u201cYou! You were one of her students, weren\u2019t you? How do you get rid of quantum . . . pests?\u201d\nPetros could only try to shrug, an awkward gesture under kilos and kilos of a lead-lined survival suit.\nKedija crouched, approaching one of the centipede things. It wasn\u2019t vanishing yet.\n\u201cWhen a conscious mind observes a quantum event,\u201d Kedija said, \u201cthe probability wave collapses. What had been possibilities before becomes a concrete decision. These don\u2019t disappear very fast. If these are manifestations of quantum probabilities, they\u2019re so complex that it might be that our consciousness isn\u2019t large enough to collapse the wave function.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what they are,\u201d Negasi said. \u201cThey\u2019re endangering us. Get rid of them! If you won\u2019t, we will.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not in Ethiopia anymore, Negasi,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to tell anyone what to do. We\u2019re all just people now.\u201d\nThe ghost centipede before her finally vanished.\n\u201cThe past doesn\u2019t vanish when you look at it, Kedija.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Hamid said into his wrist communicator, to the teams checking the outage. \u201cIt\u2019s down again. It\u2019s down again. No. It\u2019s down again. Reboot it?\u201d\nIt was the second time today that primary power systems were glitching. Hamid thought it was heating-cooling problems with the couplings. A lot of their environmental tech had been designed for Mars, whose temperature swings were larger, but more gradual. In their race to put up their shelters, they\u2019d maybe run their power systems too hot. Or maybe not.\n\u201cMore and more quantum ghosts are appearing,\u201d Kedija whispered to Petros, the white vapor of her words vanishing in the cold. Their helmets were off, but their suits were still on. The temperature in the habitat had plunged to forty below. Hamid led the efforts to get primary power back.\n\u201cThey\u2019re interacting with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re becoming part of their probabilities.\u201d\nThe display screen in front of Kedija and Petros had nothing to do with the power systems. It showed the characteristic pattern of electromagnetic wave interference, over a recording of two of the centipede ghosts.\n\u201cThe morphology of this one is different from that one,\u201d she said, pointing. The differences between the two ghosts were subtle. On one of them, the features she called \u201chead,\u201d despite the fact that there were ridges on both ends of the body, were larger. And on the smaller-headed one, there was the suggestion of a third \u201chead\u201d in the middle of the body. Each of these head-features was the source of the waves that were creating the interference patterns.\n\u201cIf there are several kinds of ghosts,\u201d she said, \u201cthey might be descended from different quantum probabilities. And when two different kinds interact, it messes with our systems.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for a single electron to interact with itself as it goes through both slits of an experiment,\u201d Petros said. \u201cThis is macroscopic.\u201d\n\u201cMacroscopic-level quantum behavior has been observed in special cases,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, not impossible.\u201d\n\u201cDoes Negasi buy it?\u201d\n\u201cI sent him these recordings with my analysis an hour ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI should call him.\u201d\nThe lights and fans came on, blowing cold air. The heating coils began to glow. A wan cheer rose from the people around them.\nKedija stepped away, calling Negasi.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Negasi asked as he answered.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the ghosts are individuals in the way we are,\u201d she said in a low voice lost in the bustle. \u201cGanymede is cold enough that their brains could probably quantum process if they were built of the right materials.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help our life support.\u201d\n\u201cIf the aliens thought with quantum logic, maybe they were even entangled to each other,\u201d she said. \u201cIf so, they\u2019re they\u2019re still entangled and interacting.\u201d\n\u201cI was already tired of being entangled with you,\u201d Negasi said. \u201cNow we\u2019re entangled with them? If they like the cold, let\u2019s cook their pyramids. I have my engineers drawing up some plans for it.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\u201cGhosts don\u2019t think.\u201d\nHe hung up. Petros came close. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go for it?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the dark and he\u2019s thinking crazy.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the nuclear power to melt millions of tons of ice.\u201d\nKedija barked a short laugh.\nFatimah came near with a small pad. \u201cWe\u2019ve finished looking at the dust from the shelves,\u201d she said, handing the pad to Kedija.\nKedija rotated the pad, looking for some point of reference. It looked like an image of an electron micrograph, grainy with odd lumps of dust around a central ball with complex ropey growths webbing it.\n\u201cThe dust in the pyramids has a lot of structure,\u201d Fatimah said. \u201cLike spores.\u201d\n\u201cDangerous?\u201d Kedija asked.\n\u201cNot to us,\u201d Fatimah said. \u201cAt a hundred and seventy below outside, they\u2019re solid. They melt completely at room temperature. Around minus a hundred though, they\u2019re like jelly, and we think they can sprout.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do they grow into?\u201d Kedija said.\nFatimah shrugged awkwardly in her survival suit. Petros took the pad and looked at her results. Fatimah swiped to other images and expanded them, showing him her work. Only Kedija noticed the centipede ghost that had appeared near her feet. While Fatimah was still swiping, Hamid\u2019s look followed Kedija\u2019s and then became wide-eyed. When Fatimah finally looked, the ghost vanished.\n\u201cDid it take three of us to make that one vanish?\u201d she said.\nA cramped little room with double-walled insulating plastic was set aside as a lab. Long after two in the morning. Kedija was slumped in her chair, chin in hands, elbows on the table. Petros sat beside her, leaning against the wall. Under a strong light, in a sealed chamber like a terrarium, little spores were warming. Cameras in the chamber magnified the spores and projected them on the wall, beside temperature and pressure readings.\n\u201cI heard Negasi somehow brought weapons in their ships,\u201d Petros said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just observers of some events from a million years ago,\u201d Kedija said. \u201cWe have a kind of choice.\u201d\nThe tiny balls of ice, within woven nets of fine hair-thin tendrils of ice, trembled, their reflectivity changing from powdered matte white to shiny pearl.\n\u201cOf course I told Fatimah to shut the hell up,\u201d Petros said. \u201cCan you imagine if people started talking about weapons?\u201d\nHe made a tsking sound, but didn\u2019t move. His passion was exhausted. Frozen.\n\u201cOur lamps can heat the surface,\u201d Kedija said.\nThe readings on the projector showed the terrarium temperature at -104\u00b0C and the pressure of just 1.2 \u00b5Pa, low enough to be doubtful there even was an atmosphere. These were the conditions of the surface, except that the spores here were bathed in warm light.\n\u201cOur conscious minds, by observing the ghosts, should put them to rest,\u201d Kedija said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just talk,\u201d Petros said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have brought weapons.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe ghosts just want to be remembered,\u201d Kedija said.\nOne of the spores was more advanced in its melt than the others. Its shiny opaque surface was blebbing outward between bands of icy, hair-thin vasculature. Whatever its surface, it was still unbroken. But the sprout was reaching, across a million years.\n\u201cBut what if Negasi paid off someone at the UN?\u201d Petros said.\n\u201cIf we revive the spores wholesale, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good for us or not,\u201d Kedija said.\nThere was a beautiful futility in reaching, a trusting ignorance of the world so profound that it could not but be admired. And it was so distant and alien a feeling that she turned it over in her mind, incredulously.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Fatimah any of that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s dangerous talk.\u201d\n\u201cWe could kill them all,\u201d she said, \u201csend them back to the ice, where they would die in the cold. If these plants are any danger, we could do that.\u201d\nThe spore casing was straining, but hadn\u2019t burst yet. She felt like reaching in and just giving it a hand, just to see what strangeness might emerge. Certainly like nothing they knew. These spores were the stranger, in the deepest human sense.\n\u201cEven before that, if we don\u2019t turn on the light,\u201d she said, \u201cif we don\u2019t warm them, then they stay frozen forever.\u201d\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s true,\u201d Petros said, \u201cthen we die all over.\u201d\nKedija didn\u2019t sleep. She suited up and cycled out the airlock, onto the icy regolith field that was their new home. The first crude habitats were blocky and inelegant, a race against time to make something to shelter them from the radiation. Their machines and supplies were stacked unevenly, adding weird colors and human invention onto an environment entirely alien.\nShe walked across a sterile garden of icy pellets and frost-haired shards made not from rain, but smashed out of the hard ice of the ground by micro-meteor impacts over millions of years. They\u2019d blasted their world too. Asmera triggered falling dominoes that scoured the highlands and valleys with fire and plutonium waste. They\u2019d made two nations of ghosts.\nJupiter hung in inscrutable judgment to the south. On the foot-stamped ground ahead of her, at the edge of her helmet light, was a ghostly, transparent centipede, as motionless as the king of the gods. Were they judging too?\nHer whole life had been in Asmera. Why had she picked that one day to go hiking, with Petros of all people? She\u2019d barely known him. What observer had made that possibility real, instead of all the other places in the capital she might have been? There was no reason for her to have survived. She was just a freak observation at the extreme edge of probability.\nShe walked closer. Her helmet light revealed more of the ghosts, all waiting in stillness, just the waving of antennae in the vacuum giving signs of life. But only a sign of life. Not real life. She could see through them.\nKedija might have been in Asmera, and in nightmares and waking, walking dreams, she had been. Did a ghostly version of herself, the path not taken, walk still among fallout fields with the ghosts of families, friends, and all the people she never knew?\nStepping forward, her helmet light revealed more of the centipede ghosts, a whole field of them. What if she wasn\u2019t real at all? What if this was the afterlife, cold and dark, a shade reaching for contact with anyone, anything, unable to understand what she was anymore. She\u2019d had a life in the fenced camps, with her refugee card, her temporary shelter, her food aid. But that didn\u2019t make her any more real than the ghosts.\nShe\u2019d walked so far forward that nothing man-made was in her vision anymore. Just a field of ghosts beneath her helmet lamp and the orange light of Jupiter.\nSo many ghosts walked the remains of their homes that no one could remember them all. Only a few thousand of them had survived. Persisted. Millions and millions had burned in radiation stronger than Jupiter\u2019s. There was no more us or them. They\u2019d killed themselves. They\u2019d killed all the Ethiopians. They\u2019d killed all the Eritreans. They were indistinguishable now, just hollow-eyed, shock-hearted bodies trying to live, trying to find something to live for, cut off from humanity, on a hard, cold world.\nNegasi\u2019s first Ethiopian habitat wasn\u2019t much better than her Eritrean one. They\u2019d inflated their Martian quick-habitat within a big igloo of ice blocks they\u2019d stacked together. The boxes were still half-packed, the walls hung with wires.\nNegasi wasn\u2019t happy she\u2019d come, and now, cycled in, she faced him and a half dozen frowning, resentful faces. Was this what she looked like? Is this what they saw in her, a kind of shocked pitilessness?\n\u201cWe can\u2019t survive if we don\u2019t work together,\u201d she said.\nNegasi was wearing the gun on his hip. \u201cIt\u2019s a big moon. We won\u2019t need to work together soon. You go your way. We go ours.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay haunted until we work together, or until the haunting kills us,\u201d she said.\nHis expression turned dubious. She took a reinforcing breath.\n\u201cWhen Asmera was nuked, I lost my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cMy brothers. My aunts. Everyone.\u201d\nThey might not have been expecting this. One of them, a younger man, looked as if she\u2019d hit him.\n\u201cI was angry,\u201d she said. \u201cAt you all. My mother never did anything to you. I wanted to kill you. Not you Negasi, but all of you. I guess you wanted to kill us, to finish the job. I\u2019m still angry, but I\u2019ve already lost everything. I don\u2019t have anything to lose anymore except maybe the possibility of a future.\u201d\nNegasi\u2019s expression shuttered, no longer hard, but not softened either. Neither opened nor closed. Waiting. Judging.\n\u201cRevenge won\u2019t bring me or this moon to life,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I want to live. But for me to live, you have to live too. It has to be both of us or neither.\u201d\nOne of them, a woman, shuffled her feet, looking away. The younger man\u2019s expression became confused, as if Kedija had said something alien.\n\u201cIf the price of you getting to live is that I might laugh one day, is that too much for you to pay, Negasi?\u201d she asked, touching a hand to the chest of her survival suit, seeking a heart lost in the layers.\n\u201cThe past can keep haunting us, or we can see the ghosts for real and exorcise them,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf million-year-old ghosts can reach across time to us, why can\u2019t we reach across a line someone drew between two countries centuries ago, one that is seven hundred million kilometers behind us?\u201d\nNegasi had the gun on his hip. And his heart covered. And the hardness in his eyes. But the hardness had a peculiar quality. Shiny. Cold. But in a way that could not be explained, only trusted and felt, the hardness was softening. Melting. As if some other feeling ached to sprout from within him.\nDozens and dozens of them were in the main pyramid, refugees all, Eritrean and Ethiopian, cautious with one another, mixing uneasily, holding hands with their eyes closed. Concentric rings of refugees, under the hard lights. Only Kedija and Negasi\u2019s eyes were open, watching the centipedes, quantum ghosts from a million years ago, collecting. She and Negasi waited.\nThey\u2019d lost something when they\u2019d been genetically engineered to survive the radiation of their home. Kedija had thought maybe they\u2019d become less human. They had the wrong number of chromosomes now. Their brains were augmented with chips to help them survive, making their perceptions partly electronic. And with the ghosts not disappearing quickly, those quantum echoes of some decision point long in the past, she\u2019d thought that maybe she\u2019d become not only less human, but less conscious.\nMore and more ghosts appeared.\nHuman consciousness collapsed possibilities into something real. Human consciousness forced the quantum world to make choices. Why did these images take so long to collapse when observed? She\u2019d been right about the problem, but wrong about the solution.\nThe ghosts were all around them now. Near feet. Behind the rings of people. Before the rings of people. \u201cOpen,\u201d she said into her helmet mic. Dozens of sets of human eyes opened all around her.\nKedija was still human. She just hadn\u2019t felt human, not since the war. But that wasn\u2019t what made the ghosts persist.\nThese quantum waves had been interacting with one another for a million years in the icy cold of a dead moon. Those interactions had grown huge with age. To force these quantum ghosts to choose a possibility would take a bigger consciousness. More than one person. More than two or three people. They needed to work together, all of them. Agree on what they saw. The refugees stood in their circles, holding hands.\nAll the ghosts were gone.\nObserved.\nDisappeared.\nWhatever the refugees had seen today, whatever quantum indecision had held these ghosts in their indeterminacy for so long, it was gone now, communicated back across the years by whatever process of spooky entanglement connected events.\nThe pyramid builders had died, but the refugees were not standing in tombs. These were spore chambers. The spores were like the new human colonists, refugees warehoused into camps. The spores had been waiting millions of years to be welcomed somewhere. Only the warmth of conscious life would tell these spores it was safe to germinate. The spores had needed to know that some community was waiting to receive them as they fled an uninhabitable past. The humans would. And in a way, whatever plants would grow here would be welcoming the refugees too.\nAfter leaving molecular biology, Derek K\u00fcnsken worked with street kids in Central America before finding himself in the Canadian foreign service.

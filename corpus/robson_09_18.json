He was exhausted from three days of travel and nauseated, too, but that wasn\u2019t the problem. He could always power through physical discomfort. But the trees, the rocks, the open sky above, and the mountains closing in\u2014it was all too strange. He kept expecting something to drop on his head.\nHe pinged Marta, the social worker in Beijing Hive who\u2019d orchestrated his escape from Luna seventy-two hours earlier.\nForget Paizuo, he whispered as his bike coasted the guideway\u2019s downslope. This is too weird.\nTurn that bike back around or I\u2019ll hit your disable button, Marta whispered back.\nYou wouldn\u2019t.\nHe turned the bike\u2019s acceleration to maximum.\nI would. You can spend the next two weeks lying at the bottom of a gully while the tribunal decides what to do with you. Turn around.\nNo, I\u2019m going back to the Danzhai roadhouse.\nWhen she scowled, her whole face crumpled into a mass of wrinkles. She didn\u2019t even look like a person anymore.\nI\u2019d do anything to keep you alive, kid, and I don\u2019t even like you. She jabbed at him with an age-spotted finger, as if she could reach across the continent and poke him in the chest. Turn back around or I\u2019ll do it.\nHe believed her. Nobody had hit his disable button since he\u2019d left Luna, but Marta was an old ex-Lunite and that meant she was both tough and mean. Zhang Lei slowed his bike, rotated back to the guideway\u2019s uphill track, and gave the acceleration dial a vicious twist.\nYou don\u2019t like me? he asked.\nMaybe a little. Marta flipped through the graphs of his biom. She had full access to that too, and could check everything from his hormone levels to his sleep cycle. You\u2019re getting dehydrated. Drink some water. And slow your bike. You\u2019re going to make yourself puke.\nI feel fine, he lied.\nMarta rolled her eyes. Relax. You\u2019ll love Paizuo. Nobody wants to kill you there.\nShe slapped the connection down, and the image of her elderly face was replaced by steep, verdant mountainside. Danzhai County was thick with an impossible greenness, in layers of bushes, trees, grasses, and herbs he had no name for.\nEverything was unfamiliar here. He knew he was deep in southwestern China, but that\u2019s about all. He knew he was surrounded by mountains, with Danzhai\u2019s transit hub behind him. It was a two-pad skip station, the smallest he\u2019d ever seen, next to a narrow lake surrounded by hills, everything green but the sky\u2014which actually was blue, like everyone always said about Earth\u2014and the buildings. Those were large, brown, and open to the air as if atmospheric weather was nothing.\nAn atmosphere people could breathe. That was Earth\u2019s one unique claim. Unlike Luna, or Venus, or Mars, or any of the built environments in the solar system, here in Danzhai and a few other places on Earth, humans lived every day exposed to weather. It was traditional, or something.\nWeather was overrated, Zhang Lei decided. The afternoon was so humid, he\u2019d sweated through his shirt. And the air wasn\u2019t clean. Bits of fluff floated in it, and it smelled weird, too. Birds zipped through the air like hovertoys launched from tree limbs\u2014were they even birds? He\u2019d seen so few on Luna.\nAt least he was alone. A year ago, he would have hated not having anyone to goof around with or show off for. No coach, no team, no fans. Now he was grateful. Marta was watching out for him, always on the other end of a ping if anything went wrong. It was a relief not having to stay ultra-alert.\nHe pinged Marta.\nHow long do I have to stay in Paizuo?\nHer face appeared again. She was shoveling noodles into her mouth with a pair of chopsticks. The sight of the food made his stomach heave.\nAt least two weeks. More if I can wrangle an extension. Ideally, I\u2019d like you to stay until the tribunal decides your case.\nOkay.\nTwo weeks. Fine. He\u2019d keep doing what she said, within reason. Drinking water, yes. Slowing the bike down, no. He wasn\u2019t going to toil up the mountain like some slack-ass oldster.\nWasn\u2019t long before he regretted that decision. The nausea wouldn\u2019t be denied any longer. He shifted on the bike\u2019s saddle and hung his head over the edge of the guideway. His mouth prickled with saliva until his guts heaved, forcing what was left of his luxurious, hand-cooked Danzhai lunch\u2014black fungus, eggplant, cucumbers, and garlic with pepper, pepper, and more pepper\u2014up, out, and over into the green gulch below. The nausea eased.\nWhen he got to the Paizuo landing stage, the guideway came to a dead end. He couldn\u2019t believe it. Just a ground-level platform with a bike rack on one side and a battery of cargo floats on the other. Zhang Lei had never even seen a landing stage with only one connection, not even in the bowels of Luna\u2019s smallest hab. Everywhere was interconnected. Not Paizuo, apparently.\nHe hooked his bike on the rack, shouldered his duffle bag, and wiped his mouth on his sleeve, flicking away a few stray pepper seeds. His lips burned.\nI said you\u2019d puke, Marta whispered. No visual this time, only a disembodied voice. Bet you feel like shit.\nYeah, but you look like shit.\nIt was the traditional Lunar reply. Marta laughed.\nDon\u2019t pull that lip here, okay? You\u2019re a guest. Be polite.\nHe shifted his bag from one shoulder to the other. Nobody seemed to be watching, aside from Marta. Behind the trees, a few brown houses climbed the side of the mountain. Where was the village? A few people were visible through the trees, but otherwise, Paizuo was a wilderness\u2014a noisy wilderness. Wind in the leaves, birds chirping, and buzzing\u2014something coming up behind him.\nZhang Lei spun, fists raised. A cargo conveyor zipped up the guideway. It slid its payload onto a float and slotted itself into place on the underside of the landing stage. The float slowly meandered up a leafy path.\nA hospitality fake showed him the way to the guest house, where he stumbled to his room, fell on top of the bed, and slept fourteen hours straight. If someone had wanted to kill him then, they easily could have. He wouldn\u2019t have cared.\nThe other three artists in the guest house were pampered oldsters from high-status habs. They made a big show of acting casual, but Zhang Lei caught each of them exchanging meaningful looks. They were probably pinging his ID to ogle his disable button, marveling at the label under it that said KILLER\u2014FAIR GAME, and discussing him in whispers.\nDuring lunch, Zhang Lei ignored them. Instead of joining their conversation, he watched a hygiene bot polish the floor.\n\u201cThe wood bothered me at first,\u201d said Prajapati, gesturing with a beringed hand at the guest house\u2019s wooden walls, floor, and ceiling. She looked soft, her dark skin plush with fat and burnished with moisturizers. Her metadata identified her as a sculptor from Bangladesh Hell. \u201cBut organic materials are actually quite hygienic, if treated properly.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the dirt,\u201d said Paul, an ancient watercolorist from Mars. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere outside.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dirt, it\u2019s soil,\u201d said the sculptor. She picked a morsel of flesh out of the bubbling pot of fish soup in the middle of the table.\n\u201cPeople from the outplanet diaspora forget that soil is life,\u201d said Han Song, a 2D photographer from Beijing Hive.\n\u201cYes, we\u2019ve all been told that a thousand times,\u201d replied the watercolorist with a smile. \u201cEarth thinks very well of itself. But I have to say, I like Paizuo. The Miao traditional lifestyle is extremely appealing.\u201d\nA woman shuffled into the dining room bearing plates of egg dumplings and sweet millet cake. The oldsters smiled and thanked her profusely. The woman wore a wide silver torque around her neck, hung with tiny bells and charms. They tinkled as she arranged the dishes. She was slender, but the profile of her abdomen showed a huge tumor under her colorful tunic.\n\u201cWhat a waste of billable hours,\u201d the watercolorist said once the chef was gone. \u201cCouldn\u2019t they task a bot with the kitchen-to-table supply chain? I know tradition is important to the Miao, but the human ability to carry plates is hardly going to die out.\u201d\nThe chef had tagged the food with detailed nutritional notes, and it said millet was good for digestive upset. After vomiting his Danzhai lunch yesterday, he couldn\u2019t face more peppers. But the millet cake was good\u2014honey-sweet and crunchy. The egg dumplings were delicious, too. He could eat the whole plate.\nMarta pinged him.\nI thought you\u2019d never wake up. Listen, don\u2019t worry about the other guests, okay? We\u2019ve had them investigated. They\u2019re all nice, quiet, trustworthy people. They agreed not to ask too many questions.\nHe shoved another dumpling in his mouth. Zhang Lei knew he ought to be grateful but he wasn\u2019t. The three oldsters were getting something out of the deal, too. They would be able to tell stories about him for the rest of their lives. I once shared accommodations with a murderer. Well, not a murderer, I suppose, not exactly, my dear, but a killer. No, I never asked him what happened but you should have seen the disable button on his ID. It said KILLER right under it. I couldn\u2019t help but stare.\nZhang Lei finished the dumplings and claimed the rest of the millet cake. He left the table still chewing, and slammed the front door behind him.\nWhat did you tell them about me? he asked Marta.\nNot much. I said you weren\u2019t responsible for what happened and we\u2019re working to have the disable button removed.\nI was responsible, though.\nZhang Lei, we\u2019ve discussed this. Do you want to ping a peer counselor? Talk therapy is effective.\nNo. I hate talking.\nThe guest house was part of a trio of houses, fronted by a cabbage patch. Large birds\u2014domestic poultry he guessed\u2014pecked at the gravel walkway that led to the guest house\u2019s kitchen door. Nearby, a huge horned mammal was tethered in the shade, along with a large caged bird that stalked back and forth and shrieked.\nZhang Lei trudged toward a peak-roofed pavilion. The midday sun stood high over the valley, veiled by humid haze. Not at all hot, but in the unfamiliar atmosphere, sweat beaded on his scarred forearms.\nThe pavilion overlooked the terraced fields descending the valley and the hazy fleet of mountains on the horizon. No blue sky today. He might as well be in a near-Sun orbit greenhouse hab, deep in the eye of its dome, every sprout, bud, and bloom indexed and graphed. The locals probably used the same agricultural tech here. Each of the green-and-yellow plants in the terraces below was probably monitored by an agronomist up the mountain, watching microsensors buried in the soil and deploying mineral nutrition with pinpoint accuracy.\nZhang Lei pinged one of the plants. Nothing came back, not even an access denial. He tried pinging one of the farmers working far below, then a nearby tree. Still nothing. Frantic, he flung pings across the valley.\nAll of the Paizuo guest houses answered immediately. A map highlighted various routes up and down the valley. The guideway landing stage sent him the past two days of traffic history and offered average travel times to various down-slope destinations. A lazy stream of ID information flowed from the guest artists, thirty in total.\nSeveral hazard warnings floated over their targets: Watch for snakes. Beware of dog. Dangerous cliff. But no pings from the locals, or any of the crops, equipment, or businesses. Not even from the wooden hand-truck upended over a pile of dirt at the side of the path. But no way this village ran everything data-free.\nHis pings summoned the hospitality fake. It hovered at his elbow, head inclined with a gently inquiring look.\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I get a pingback from anything here?\u201d he demanded.\nIt gave Zhang Lei a generic smile. \u201cPaizuo data streams are restricted to members of the Miao indigenous community.\u201d\n\u201cSo I can\u2019t find out anything?\u201d His face grew hot with anger. Stuck here for weeks or more, totally ignorant, unable to learn anything or find out how the village worked.\nThe fake nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions if I\u2019m able.\u201d\nZhang Lei wasn\u2019t in the mood for cr\u00e8che-level games. He slapped it down, hard. The fake misted away, immediately replaced by Marta in full length. She had her fists on her hips and didn\u2019t look pleased.\nFeeling a little aggressive, Zhang Lei? You didn\u2019t say two words to your fellow guests, and now you\u2019re getting testy with a fake.\nI\u2019m sorry, okay? Embarrassing. He should have controlled himself. I hate this place.\nNo, you don\u2019t. You\u2019re out of your element. Nothing here is any threat to you. She grinned. Not unless you have a phobia of domestic animals.\nHah, he grumbled.\nGo for a walk. Do a little sketching. Get familiar with the village. There\u2019s lots to see, and it\u2019s all gorgeous. There\u2019s a reason why artists love Paizuo.\nOkay. He booted up his viewcatcher. Marta gave him an approving nod and dissolved.\nTrue, Paizuo was beautiful. From the pavilion, mountains thick with trees stretched sharp and steep over the valley, where green and yellow terraced fields stepped up and down the lower slopes, punctuated by small groups of wooden houses under tall trees. He framed the composition in his viewcatcher. It was perfect, pre-chewed\u2014the whole reason the pavilion had been built there in the first place. The fang-like form of the tallest mountain clutched in the spiral fist of the golden mean. Nice.\nEven though the view was prepackaged, framing it in his viewcatcher was satisfying. And what a relief to be able to do it openly. Back on Luna, he had to be careful not to get caught using the viewcatcher, or he\u2019d get smacked by one of his teammates or screamed at by his coach. Zhang Lei was allowed to draw cartoons and caricatures, but everything else was a distraction from training and a waste of time and focus.\nTotal commitment to the game, that\u2019s what all coaches demanded.\n\u201cWhat do you love better, hockey or scribbling on little bits of paper?\u201d Coach had demanded, and then smacked him on the back of the head when he hesitated.\n\u201cHockey,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cRight. Don\u2019t forget it.\u201d\nSo he drew cartoons of his teammates, their rival teams, and stars from the premier leagues they all wanted to get drafted into. He got good. Fast. Accurate. In thirty seconds, he could toss off a sketch that got the whole team hooting. Coach liked it, said it was good for morale. But quick, sketchy work didn\u2019t satisfy. Neither did the digital-canvas painting he snuck past Coach on occasion, but both were better than nothing.\nHe padded down a trail to the first terrace, flipping his viewcatcher through its modes\u2014thirds to notan to golden mean to phi grid\u2014as he strode along the edge. The earthen berm bounding the terrace was less than a meter wide, and seemed to be made entirely of dirt. The next terrace was ten meters below on his left.\nHe blacked out edges of the view, widened the margins until nothing was visible outside his constantly expanding and contracting search for a composition. He swept back and forth across the landscape. Then he slipped and fell. The viewcatcher framed a close-up of green plants in brown water.\nZhang Lei lurched sideways, regaining his footing, the right leg of his pants wet to the knee and slimy with mud. He dismissed the viewcatcher and stared incredulously around him.\nThe matrix of the terraces was liquid, not soil. Water and mud. He\u2019d seen it glinting between the greenery, but he hadn\u2019t realized it was water. And now he was covered in it.\nA fleeting thought\u2014I\u2019m going to die here\u2014easily dismissed. All he had to do was watch where he put his feet as he explored.\nPaizuo wasn\u2019t what Zhang Lei expected. The village wasn\u2019t all one piece like ancient towns in cr\u00e8che storybooks. It was spread thin, covering the whole valley, the houses clustered in groups under the trees and separated by fields and paddies. The Miao didn\u2019t build on flat or even sloping land\u2014those areas seemed dedicated to crops. Instead, they chose the precipitous and rocky landscape for their multilevel wooden homes. Each house stood on stilts over the canted landscape, the weight of the structures leaning back on the mountainside. Livestock sheltered in the shade beneath, some tethered or penned, some roaming free.\nActual live animals, like the ones behind the guest house, and a lot of them. With humans living literally on top of them.\nA deep voice knocked Zhang Lei out of his thoughts. Unfamiliar syllables. When he turned to look, the translation word balloon hung over the man\u2019s head:\n\u201cHello, can I help you?\u201d\nNo ID accessible, but the balloon was tagged with his name: Jen Dang. Not tall, but broad-shouldered and athletic, with skin deeply burnished by the sun and a wide, strong face. Old, but not an oldster.\nZhang Lei switched on his translation app.\n\u201cI arrived yesterday,\u201d Zhang Lei said. \u201cTrying to get used to everything.\u201d\nJen Dang scanned the balloon overhead.\n\u201cAre the insects troubling you?\u201d\n\u201cInsects?\u201d Zhang Lei frowned and scanned the ground. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any yet.\u201d\n\u201cRight there.\u201d Jen Dang pointed at one of the fluttering creatures he had no name for.\n\u201cOh, I thought insects lived on the ground. I\u2019m from\u2014\u201d He almost said Luna but caught himself in time. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on Earth before. It\u2019s different.\u201d\n\u201cMost of our guests use seers to help them identify plants and animals. Paizuo is a biodiversity preserve, with thousands of different species.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll do that, thanks.\u201d\nJen Dang fell silent. Zhang Lei could feel himself warming to the stranger. Lots of charisma and natural authority. He\u2019d do well on Luna.\n\u201cThe food is really good here,\u201d he said.\nA shadow of a smile crossed Jen Dang\u2019s face.\n\u201cJen Dla is my daughter. She\u2019s an experienced chef.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Zhang Lei said, and other man squinted at him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice she\u2019s sick.\u201d He gestured vaguely in the region of his stomach.\nJen Dang shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a guest. There are lots of things guests can\u2019t understand. Would you like to see another?\u201d\nTwo large baskets lay under a tree. Jen Dang plucked them from the ground and led Zhang Lei down a tree-lined path, the slope so extreme the route soon turned into uneven stairs, cut into the dirt and haphazardly incised with slabs of rock. Mammals grazed on either side, standing nearly on their hind legs while cropping the ground cover.\nThey descended five terrace levels before Zhang Lei\u2019s thighs started getting hot. Stairs were a good workout, mostly cardio but some leg strength, and uneven steps were good balance training, too. For a moment he lost himself in the rhythm of their rapid descent. It was enjoyable. He could run the stairs in morning and evening before doing his squats and lunges\u2014but then he remembered. He wasn\u2019t an athlete anymore. And with the disable button on his ID labeling him a killer, nobody in Danzhai, Miao or guest, needed to wonder what he was training for, or if he was chasing someone.\nHe slowed, letting the distance widen between himself and the farmer. If someone got worried and hit the button, he\u2019d roll right down the mountain.\nJen Dang shucked his shoes and rolled up his trouser legs as he waited for Zhang Lei at one of the lower terraces.\n\u201cMany guests are squeamish of the rice paddies, but it\u2019s only water and mud,\u201d he said when Zhang Lei joined him. \u201cAnd worms. Bugs of course. A few snakes. And fish.\u201d He hefted the large basket. It was bottomless\u2014an open, woven cylinder.\n\u201cNot a problem.\u201d Zhang Lei pulled off his shoes, but didn\u2019t roll up his pant legs. One was still damp. The other might as well get wet, too.\nJen Dang handed him the smaller basket and waded into the sodden paddy, bottomless basket clutched in both hands.\n\u201cStep between the rice plants, never on them. Try not to stir up too much mud, or you can\u2019t see the fish.\u201d\nJen Dang demonstrated, moving slowly and looking at the water through the basket. Zhang Lei followed. The mud was cool. It squelched through his toes.\n\u201cUse the basket to shade the water\u2019s surface,\u201d the farmer said. \u201cLook for movement. A flash of scales or the flick of a tail.\u201d\nAs Zhang Lei followed the farmer through the paddy, he took care to keep his feet away from the knee-high rice plants. Each one was topped by knobby spikes\u2014the grain portion of the crop, he assumed. Some of the grain was coated with a milky substance, and some was turning yellow.\nJen Dang plunged the bottomless basket in the water and said, \u201cCome look.\u201d\nA fish was trapped inside. Jen Dang reached into the water and flipped it into Zhang Lei\u2019s basket. It struggled, thrashing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one, we need six. You catch the rest.\u201d\nZhang Lei made several tries before he trapped a fish large enough to meet Jan Dang\u2019s standards. Catching the rest took a full hour. The sky cleared and turned Earth-blue. The older man betrayed no trace of impatience, even though it was a ridiculous expenditure of effort to procure basic foodstuffs when a nutritional extruder could feed hundreds of people an hour, with personalized flavor and texture profiles and optimal nutrition.\nWhen they finished, Zhang Lei\u2019s eyes ached from squinting against the flare of sun on water. He wiped his fish-slick hands on his pants and followed the farmer up the stairs.\n\u201cWhy do you do this?\u201d he asked.\nJen Dang stopped and eyed the word balloon over Zhang Lei\u2019s head.\n\u201cStubbornness. That\u2019s what my wife says. She\u2019s a orthopedic surgeon, takes care of all the Miao in Danzhai county. She won\u2019t farm. Says her hands are meant for higher things. She loves to cook, though. She taught all our daughters.\u201d\n\u201cBut why do manual labor when you could use bots?\u201d\n\u201cWe use some, but we\u2019re not dependent on them. If we don\u2019t do the work, who will?\u201d\n\u201cNobody.\u201d\n\u201cThen nobody will know how to do it. All traditional skills and knowledge will be lost, along with our language, stories, songs\u2014everything that makes us Miao. We do it to survive.\u201d\n\u201cYou could write it down.\u201d\nJen Dang laughed. He lifted the fish basket to his shoulder and ran up the stairs two at a time. His word balloon blossomed behind him.\n\u201cSome things can only be mastered with constant practice.\u201d\nThat was true. Nobody could learn to play hockey by watching a doc. Or learn to draw or paint without actually doing it.\nAn insect landed on a nearby plant. Its wide, delicate wings had eyelike patterns in shades of gold and copper. Zhang Lei framed it in his viewcatcher, then panned up to include the mountains in the composition. Gold wings and green slopes, copper eyes and blue sky. Perfect.\nAnother insect hung in the sky, hovering motionless, shaped like a half circle and very faint. Zhang Lei stared for a whole minute before realizing what he was looking at.\nThe moon. Luna itself. The home of everything he knew, and everyone who wanted to hurt him. Watching.\nOver the next week, the moon turned its back on him, retreating through its last quarter to a thinning sickle. In the morning, when he ventured onto the guest house\u2019s porch for a stretch, there it was, lurking behind the boughs of a fir tree, half-hidden behind mountain peaks, or veiled in humid haze to the east. Sometimes it hid on the other side of the globe. Then the next time he looked, it was right overhead, staring at him.\nNight was the worst. The lights of the habs glared from the dark lunar surface aside the waning crescent\u2014the curved sickle of Purovsk, the oval of Olenyok, the diamond pinpoint of Bratsk, the five-pointed star of Harbin.\nA few years back, an investment group had tried to float a proposal to build a new hab on Mare Insularum, its lights outlining a back-turned fist with an extended middle finger. Zhang Lei and his teammates had worn the proposed hab pattern on their gym shirts for a few months, the finger mocked up extra large on a dark moon, telling Earth and all its inhabitants what Lunites thought of them.\nHe could stay inside at night, but he couldn\u2019t hide from the moon during the day. It watched him with a sideways smile. We see you\u2014we\u2019re coming to get you.\nHe tried not to think about it, and concentrated on finding compositions with his viewcatcher. He made sketches and studies, and looked up plants and animals with his seer, and tried to learn their names. When he ran into artists from the other guest houses, they were friendly enough, but all much older than him.\nAt night, he worked on studies and small canvases in his room, door closed and windows dark. They were disasters: muddy greens, lifeless brushwork, flat compositions. He tried all the tricks he\u2019d learned in the cr\u00e8che\u2014glazing, underpainting, overpainting, scraping with a palette knife, dry brush, but nothing worked.\nWhy don\u2019t you try some familiar subjects? Marta suggested. Limber up first, then branch out into new things.\nIf you say so.\nHe was so frustrated he\u2019d try anything. He lugged his easel and kit up to the guest house\u2019s communal studio and set up in his own corner of the work space.\n\u201cI was beginning to think we\u2019d never see you up here,\u201d said Paul. \u201cWelcome.\u201d\n\u201cThe light\u2019s especially good in the afternoon,\u201d said Prajapati.\nHan Song paused his hands over his work surface for a moment and nodded.\nNothing motivated Zhang Lei like competition. He would destroy the watercolorist with his superior command of light and shadow, teach the sculptor about form, show the photographer how to compose a scene.\nHis old viewcatcher compositions and stealthily-made reference sketches were gone forever, so he worked from memory. He attacked the canvas with his entire arsenal, blocking out a low-angle view of Mons Hadley and the shining towers of Sklad, with the hab\u2019s vast hockey arena in the foreground under a gleaming crystal dome. The view might be three hundred and eighty thousand kilometers away, but it lay at his fingertips, and he created it anew every time he closed his eyes.\nThe paint leapt to Zhang Lei\u2019s brush, clung to the canvas, spread thin and lean and true exactly where it should, the way it should, creating the effects he intended. After a week of flailing with sappy greens and sloppy, organic shapes, he finally had a canvas under control. He worked late, muttering good night to the other artists without raising his eyes from his work. When dawn stretched its fingers through the studio\u2019s high windows, the painting was done\u2014complete with a livid crimson stain spreading under the arena\u2019s crystal dome.\nHe didn\u2019t remember deciding to paint blood on the ice, or putting crimson on his palette. But the color belonged there. It was the truth. It showed what he did.\nZhang Lei lowered himself to the floor, leaned his back against the wall with his elbows on his knees, and rested his head in his hands. He pinged Marta. She blinked blearily at him for a few seconds, her eyes swollen with sleep. He pointed at the canvas.\nHave any of the other artists seen this? she whispered.\nI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so.\nIt\u2019s important they don\u2019t. Okay? Do you understand why?\nBecause people are looking for me.\nNot only that. She scrubbed her eyes with the heels of her hands. The Lunite ambassador is trying to block your immigration application. She made an official information request. If the media gets interested we\u2019ll have to move you, fast. And yes, people are searching. Three teams of Lunite brawlers have been skipping all over the planet, asking questions. They found someone in Sudbury Hell who remembers you getting on a skip bound for Chongqing Hive. That\u2019s too close for comfort.\nI can destroy the canvas, he said, voice flat and scraped clean of emotion. It was the first real painting he\u2019d done since he left the cr\u00e8che. But he couldn\u2019t look at it. When he did, his flesh crawled.\nNo. Don\u2019t do that. Hide it.\nHe nodded. It\u2019s a decent painting.\nYeah. Not bad. You worked out the kinks.\nHe knocked his head against the wall behind him. Wood was harder than it looked. He swung his head harder.\nStop that.\nThere\u2019s no point, Marta. Those brawlers are going to find me.\nNo, they won\u2019t. And chances are good the tribunal will rule in your favor. We have to be patient.\nEven if I get to live in Beijing, people will still find out what I did.\nThey\u2019ll assume you had no choice. Everyone knows Luna is the most dangerous place in the solar system.\nI did have a choice\u2014\nMarta interrupted. It was a mistake. An accident. It could happen to any hockey player.\nI aimed for Dorgon\u2019s neck.\nYou did what you were taught, and so did Dorgon. Playing hockey isn\u2019t the only way to die on Luna. If you live in a place where getting killed is accepted as a possible outcome, then you also accept that you might become a killer.\nBut we don\u2019t understand what it means.\nNo. Marta looked sad. No, we don\u2019t.\nThe day after he\u2019d killed Dorgon, Zhang Lei\u2019s team hauled him to a surgeon. Twenty minutes was all it took to install the noose around his carotid artery, then two minutes to connect the disable button and process the change to his ID. His teammates were as gentle as they could be. When it was all done, the team\u2019s enforcer clasped Zhang Lei\u2019s shoulder in a meaty hand.\n\u201cWe test it now,\u201d Korchenko said, and Zhang Lei had gone down like a slab of meat.\nWhen he woke, his friends looked concerned, sympathetic, even a little regretful.\nThat attitude didn\u2019t last long. After the surgery, the team traveled to a game in Surgut. Zhang Lei\u2019s disable button was line-of-sight. Anyone who could see it could trigger it. He passed out five times along the way, and spent most of the game slumped on the bench, head lolling, his biom working hard to keep him from brain damage. His teammates had to carry him home.\nFor a few weeks, they treated him like a mascot, hauling him from residence to practice rink to arena and back again. They soon tired of it and began leaving him behind. The first time he went out alone he came back on a cargo float, with a shattered jaw and boot-print-shaped bruises on his gut. That was okay. He figured he deserved it.\nThen one night after an embarrassing loss, the team began hitting the button for fun. First Korchenko, as a joke. Then the others. Didn\u2019t take long for Zhang Lei to become their new punching bag. So he ran. Hid out in Sklad\u2019s lower levels, pulling temporary privacy veils over his ID every fifteen minutes to keep the team from tracking him. When they were busy at the arena warming up for a game, he bolted for Harbin.\nHe passed out once on the way to the nearest intra-hab connector, but the brawler who hit his disable button was old and drunk. Zhang Lei collected a few kicks to the ribs and one to the balls before the drunk staggered off. Nobody else took the opportunity to get their licks in, but nobody helped him, either.\nBoarding the connector, he got lucky. A cr\u00e8che manager was transferring four squalling newborns, and the crib\u2019s noise-dampening tech was broken. The pod emptied out\u2014just him and the cr\u00e8che manager. She ignored him all the way to Harbin. He kept his distance, but when they got to their destination, he followed her into the bowels of the hab. She was busy with the babies and didn\u2019t notice at first. But when he joined her in an elevator, she got scared.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded, her voice high with tension.\nHe tried to explain, but she was terrified. That big red label on his button\u2014KILLER\u2014FAIR GAME\u2014didn\u2019t fill people with confidence in his character. She hit the button hard, several times. He spent an hour on the floor of the elevator, riding from level to level, and came to with internal bleeding, a cracked ocular orbit, three broken ribs, and a vicious bite mark on his left buttock.\nHe limped down to the lowest level, where they put the cr\u00e8ches, and found his old cr\u00e8che manager. She was gray, stooped, and much more frail than he remembered.\n\u201cZhang Lei.\u201d She put a gentle palm on his head\u2014the only place that didn\u2019t hurt. \u201cI was your first cuddler. I decanted you myself. I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d\nIf he cried then, he never admitted it.\nZhang Lei watched Jen Dla carry a pot of soup into the dining room. She moved awkwardly, shifting her balance around that bulbous gut. He couldn\u2019t understand it. Why hadn\u2019t she had an operation to remove the tumor? Her mother was even a surgeon.\nTerminal, he guessed, and then realized he\u2019d been staring.\nJen Dla nestled the pot on the stove in the middle of the table, and lit the flame. He caught the chef\u2019s eye as she adjusted the temperature of the burner.\n\u201cYour father must be an important man here in Paizuo,\u201d he said.\nJen Dla laughed.\n\u201cHe certainly thinks so.\u201d She laid her hand on the embroidered blouse draped over her bulging abdomen. \u201cFathers get more self-important with every new grandchild.\u201d\nShe tapped her finger on her stomach. Zhang Lei sat back in his chair, abruptly. She wasn\u2019t sick, but pregnant\u2014actually bearing a child.\n\u201cAre all Miao children body-birthed?\u201d he blurted.\nShe looked a little offended. \u201cMiao who choose to live in Paizuo generally like to follow tradition.\u201d\nAbrupt questions leapt behind his teeth\u2014does it hurt, are you frightened\u2014but her expression was forbidding.\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. She smiled and returned to her kitchen.\nAfter talking to Marta, he\u2019d taken the painting down to his room and hidden it under the bed, then collapsed into dream-clouded sleep. The arena at Sklad, deserted, the vast spread of ice all his own. The blades of his skates cut the surface as he built speed, gathered himself, and launched into a quad, spinning through the air so fast the flesh of his face pulled away and snapped back into place on landing. He jumped, spun, jumped again.\nDreams of power and joy, ruined on waking. He\u2019d pulled the painting from under his bed and hid it behind the sofa in the guest house lounge.\nJen Dla\u2019s soup began to bubble. Tomatoes bobbed in the sour rice broth. Zhang Lei watched the fish turn opaque as it cooked, then pinged one word at the three artists upstairs\u2014lunch. They clattered down.\n\u201cLooked like you were having a productive session yesterday,\u201d Prajapati said. \u201cGood to see.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop the flow,\u201d Han Song added.\nPaul grinned. \u201cNothing artists love more than giving unwanted advice.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called encouragement,\u201d said Prajapati. \u201cAnd it\u2019s especially important for young artists.\u201d\n\u201cYoung competitors, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it that way.\u201d She turned to Zhang Lei. \u201cDo you?\u201d\nAll three artists watched him expectantly. Zhang Lei stared at his hands resting on the wooden tabletop. He\u2019d forgotten to roll down his sleeves. His forearms were exposed, the scarred skin dotted with pigment. He put his hands in his lap.\n\u201cI think the fish is ready,\u201d he said.\nAfter lunch, while exploring for new compositions, he found Jen Dang behind the guest house. The water buffalo\u2014one of the first creatures he\u2019d looked up on his seer\u2014was tethered to a post by a loop of rope through its nose. It was huge, lavishly muscled, and heavy, with ridged, back-curving horns, but it stood placidly as Jen Dang examined its hooves.\n\u201cStay back,\u201d Jen Dang said. \u201cWater buffalo aren\u2019t as friendly as they look. He\u2019s not a pet.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d said Zhang Lei. When he\u2019d sketched the water buffalo, a stern warning had popped into his eye: Do not approach. Will trample, gouge, and kick.\nHe lifted his viewcatcher and captured a composition: Jen Dang stooping with his back turned to the water buffalo, drawing its massive hindquarter between his own legs and trapping the hoof between his knees.\n\u201cAll he has to do is back up, and you\u2019ll get squashed,\u201d said Zhang Lei.\n\u201cHe knows me.\u201d Jen Dang dropped the hoof and patted the animal\u2019s rump. \u201cAnd he knows the best part of his day is about to begin.\u201d\nThe farmer untied the rope from the post and led the animal up the narrow trail behind the houses. Zhang Lei followed. A bird stalked from between the trees, its red, gold, and blue body trailing long, spotted brown tail feathers. His seer tagged it: Golden Pheasant, followed by a symbol that meant major symbolic and cultural importance to the indigenous people at this geographical location. Which was no different from most of the plants and animals the seer had identified.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve been using a seer,\u201d he said, as if his rice paddy conversation with Jen Dang had happened that morning instead of days ago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain anything. Why is every butterfly important to Miao but not the flies? Why one species of bee but not the other?\u201d\n\u201cThe butterfly is our mother,\u201d Jen Dang said.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cI might ask you who your mother is, if I were young and rude, and didn\u2019t know better.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a mother. I was detanked.\u201d\n\u201cThat means you\u2019re the product of genetic advection, from a tightly edited stream of genetic material subscribed to by your cr\u00e8che. How is that less strange than having a butterfly mother?\u201d\n\u201cIs the butterfly thing a metaphor?\u201d\nJen Dang glanced over his shoulder, his gaze cold. \u201cIf you like.\u201d\nThe water buffalo lipped the tail of Jen Dang\u2019s shirt. He tapped its nose with the palm of his hand to warn it off. The trail widened as it began to climb a high ridge. The water buffalo was heavy but strong. It heaved itself up the slope, like a boulder rolling uphill. Jen Dang ran alongside to keep pace, so Zhang Lei ran after. The exertion felt good, scrambling uphill against the full one-point-zero, with two workout partners. So what if one of them was an animal? Zhang Lei would take what he could get.\nWhen the trail widened, he took the chance to sprint ahead. He made it to the top of the ridge a full ten seconds before the water buffalo. Jen Dang looked him up and down.\n\u201cNot bad. Most guests are slow.\u201d\nZhang Lei grinned. \u201cI train in the dubs.\u201d\n\u201cDubs?\u201d\n\u201cDouble Earth-normal gravity. You know. For strength.\u201d\n\u201cI never would have guessed.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Zhang Lei said eagerly. \u201cI look bottom-heavy, right? Narrow above a wide butt and thick legs. That\u2019s what makes me a good skater.\u201d\nShut up, Marta hissed in his ear. But he couldn\u2019t stop. Finally a real conversation.\n\u201cI train for optimal upper body flexibility, like all center forward play\u2014\u201d\nOne twinge in his throat, that\u2019s all it took to send Zhang Lei plummeting to the ground. He twisted and rolled when he hit the dirt\u2014away from the edge of the hill, and then the world faded to mist.\nZhang Lei clawed his way to consciousness.\nYou\u2019re fine, you\u2019re fine, nobody\u2019s touched you.\nOkay, he mumbled.\nYou\u2019ve only been down five minutes, Marta added. Tell him you have a seizure disorder and your neurologist is fine-tuning your treatment protocol. Say it.\nZhang Lei struggled to focus. His eyelids fluttered as he tried to form the words.\n\u201cI get seizures.\u201d He licked his lips. \u201cDoc\u2019s working on it.\u201d\nJen Dang said something. Zhang Lei forced his eyes to stay open. He was collapsed on his side, cheek pressed to the dirt. Three ants crawled not ten centimeters from his eye. He flopped onto his back to read the farmer\u2019s word balloon.\n\u201cYour medical advisory said it wasn\u2019t an emergency, and I shouldn\u2019t touch you.\u201d Behind Jen Dang, the water buffalo cast a lazy brown eye over him and shook its head.\nTell him you\u2019ll be fine, Marta demanded. Ask him not to mention it to anyone.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Zhang Lei pushed himself onto his elbows, then to his knees. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about this, okay?\u201d\nThe farmer looked dubious. He gathered the water buffalo\u2019s lead rope.\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you back to the studio.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Zhang Lei jumped to his feet. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with me. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nBetter not, Marta grumbled.\nZhang Lei led the way up the trail. Jen Dang followed. The water buffalo wasn\u2019t dawdling anymore, it was moving fast, nearly trotting. The track converged on a single-lane paved road, which snaked up the valley in a series of switchbacks. They were higher now, the guest houses far below, and everywhere, rice terraces brimmed with ripening grain yellow as the sun. He could paint those terraces with slabs of cadmium yellow. Maybe he would.\n\u201cWhich way?\u201d\nZhang Lei needn\u2019t have asked. The water buffalo turned onto the road and trundled uphill. Before long, the slope gentled. Houses lined the road, with gardens and rice paddies behind. The road ended at a circular courtyard patterned with dark and light stones and half-bounded by a stream. At the far end, a footbridge arched over the water, leading to more houses beyond.\nThe animal\u2019s tail switched back and forth. It trotted toward the water, splayed hooves clopping on the courtyard\u2019s patterned surface. A hygiene sweeper darted out of its path. At the stream\u2019s edge, where the courtyard\u2019s stone patterns gave way to large, dark slabs, the water buffalo paused, lowered its head, and stepped into the water.\nA man called out from one of the houses across the bridge. Jen Dang shouted a reply. No word balloon appeared.\nJen Dang offered the lead rope to Zhang Lei.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll stay in the water. I\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d\nZhang Lei leaned on the bridge railings, flipping the rope to keep it from tangling in the animal\u2019s horns as it luxuriated in the water below. The stream wasn\u2019t deep, only a meter or so, but the beast lay on its side and rolled, keeping its white beard, eyes, and horns above water.\nWhen Jen Dang returned, the water buffalo was scratching its long, drooping ear on a half-submerged rock. Zhang Lei kept the rope.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d he said. \u201cBest part of my day, too.\u201d\nThe farmer sauntered across the courtyard and joined a pair of friends working in the shade of a mulberry tree.\nZhang Lei composed a series of canvases. The water buffalo with its eyelids lowered in pleasure, lips parted to reveal a gleaming row of bottom teeth. Three women in bright blue blouses weaving in an open workshop, their silver torques flashing. A man in deep indigo embroidered with pink and silver diamonds, sorting through a table piled with feathers. Jen Dang leaning on a low stone wall, deep in conversation with two friends using gleaming axes to chop lengths of bamboo. A white-haired woman in an apron stirring a barrel of viscous liquid with a wooden paddle. A battery of pink-cheeked, scrubbed children racing across the courtyard as a golden pheasant stalked in the opposite direction. A row of cabbages beside the road. Herbs clinging to a slate outcropping. A dragonfly skipping over the water. The tallest peak puncturing the western horizon like a fang on the underjaw of a huge beast.\nAesthetically pleasing, peaceful, picturesque. But all communities had tensions and contradictions. Only a Miao could identify the deeper meaning in these scenes. Only a great artist could paint the picturesque and make it important. He wasn\u2019t Miao and he was no great artist. Could he capture the water buffalo\u2019s expression of ecstasy as it pawed the water? Not likely. But he could paint the mountain. Nothing more banal than another mountain view. But he loved that unnamed peak. He\u2019d loved Mons Hadley, too.\nJen Dang waved. A word balloon blossomed over his head: Let\u2019s go.\nHe jiggled the rope. The water buffalo ignored him. He flapped it, then gave the gentlest of tugs. The buffalo snorted and heaved itself out of the water. It stood there dripping for a moment, then its skin shivered. It lowered its head, shaking its great bulk and coating Zhang Lei in a local rainstorm.\nZhang Lei wiped his face on his sleeve. The men were still laughing when he joined them. Nothing more fun than watching a rookie fall on his ass.\nJen Dang was still chatting. Zhang Lei waited nearby, in the shade of a house. Along the wall was a metal cage much like the one behind the guest house. A rooster stalked back and forth, its face, comb, and wattle bright red, its bare breast and scraggly back caked with clean, healing sores. It stared at Zhang Lei with a malevolent orange eye, lifted one fiercely-taloned yellow leg, and flipped its water dish.\n\u201cStupid bird,\u201d Zhang Lei muttered.\nAround the corner was another cage, another rooster in similar condition, its comb sliced in dangling pieces. When it screamed\u2014raucous, belligerent\u2014the other bird answered. Zhang Lei knew an exchange of challenges when he heard it.\n\u201cAre these fighting cocks?\u201d he asked when Jen Dang joined him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have them on Luna?\u201d he answered.\nShit, whispered Marta. Tell him you\u2019re from the Sol Belt. You\u2019ve never been to Luna.\nWhy don\u2019t you hit my disable button again? Load me on a cargo float and stick me in a hole somewhere? Or better yet\u2014a cage. Evict one of the birds and get me my own dish of water.\nI might have to do that. Listen kid, it\u2019s never been more important for you to be discreet.\nWhy? Are they coming for me?\nSilence.\nThey are, aren\u2019t they? Answer me.\nA Lunite team tracked you to the Danzhai roadhouse, but don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ve got people on the ground, planting rumors to lure them to Guiyang. Even if they don\u2019t take the bait, Danzhai County has lots of towns and villages. You\u2019re still safe.\n\u201cI\u2019m from the Sol Belt,\u201d he told Jen Dang. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Luna.\u201d\nThe farmer didn\u2019t look convinced.\nZhang Lei\u2019s hand stole up to his throat. Under his jaw, where his pulse pounded, the hard mass of the noose waited to choke off his life.\nWhen Zhang Lei got back to the studio, the other three artists were upstairs. He shoved the sofa aside. The painting leaned against the wall, facing out, a layer of breathable sealant protecting the drying oil paint. He was sure he\u2019d turned it to face the wall, but apparently not. It didn\u2019t really matter. He wanted it gone.\nHe sprayed the canvas with another layer of sealant, trying not to look at the thick wet bloody gleam on the arena\u2019s ice. He wrapped it in two layers of black polymer sheeting, and requested a cargo wrap to meet him at the guideway landing stage.\nWhen he got there, the area was packed with Miao arriving on sliders and bikes, whole families crowded onto multi-seat units, laughing and talking. He edged his way to the cargo drop, slid the cargo wrap around it, addressed it to Marta, and shoved the painting inside the conveyor. Done. He\u2019d never have to think about it again.\nThe Miao were on holiday. Women wore their blue blouses with short skirts trailing with long, flapping ribbons, or ankle-length red and blue dresses. All the women\u2019s clothing was dense with colorful embroidery and tinkling with silver, and all wore their silver torques. The younger women pierced their topknots with flowers. Mothers and grandmothers layered their torques with necklaces, and wore tall silver headdresses crowned with slender, curving horns. Silver everywhere\u2014charms in the shape of flowers, bells, fish, and butterflies dangled from their jewelry, sleeves, sashes, and hems.\nThey were, in a word, gorgeous. Happy-laughing, leading children, carrying babies, holding hands with their friends, and among them, men of all ages in embroidered black, blue, and indigo. The men were also happy, also laughing, also embracing their friends, helping their children and elders. But the young women\u2014ah. They caught his eye.\nZhang Lei retreated to the side of a corn patch, capturing compositions while watching the steady flow of arrivals. Some pinged for mobility assistance, and rode float chairs up the road, but most walked. Some eschewed the road, and ran uphill toward the guest house, making for the steep shortcut up the ridge. Zhang Lei followed.\nPaul, Prajapati, and Han Song watched from the studio porch. Zhang Lei joined them.\n\u201cJen Dla told me we can go watch the festival after supper,\u201d Prajapati said. \u201cIt\u2019s called Setting Free Your Daughter, or something like that.\u201d\n\u201cSetting them free from what?\u201d asked Han Song.\nSix young women ran toward them, through Jen Dla\u2019s cabbage patch.\n\u201cFamily control, I would imagine,\u201d Paul answered.\nThe girls didn\u2019t even glance up. At home, he never had to work to get a girl\u2019s attention\u2014nobody on the team did. Unless coach called a ban for training reasons, sex was on offer everywhere he looked. Here, he might as well be invisible. But then, he hadn\u2019t exactly been making himself available. If the girls were being set free, and he was in the right place at the right time, maybe one of them would land in his lap. All he had to do was get them to notice him.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to the festival,\u201d Zhang Lei said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go too,\u201d said Han Song. \u201cI haven\u2019t done enough exploring.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all go,\u201d said Prajapati. Paul nodded.\nAfter Jen Dla served them an early supper, Zhang Lei led the oldsters up the winding road to the village center. They admired the views from every switchback as if they hadn\u2019t already had a week to explore, and examined every clump of flowers as if Paizuo wasn\u2019t one big flower garden. Guests from the other studios joined them, which made the whole group even slower.\nZhang Lei was tempted to leave them all behind, run to the village center and see if the girls had been set free yet. He jogged up a few switchbacks, and then thought the better of it. Even the most adventurous girl would flee from a lone man bearing a disable button labeled KILLER. If he wanted someone to take a chance on trusting him, he\u2019d better stick with the group.\nZhang Lei sat on a boulder at the side of the road and waited for the oldsters to catch up. They weren\u2019t bad people. All three were kind and clever in their own ways. And patient. He\u2019d been unfriendly but they hadn\u2019t taken offence.\n\u201cWe should really walk faster,\u201d Prajapati told the other two when they caught up. \u201cWe don\u2019t want Zhang Lei to miss his chance with the girls.\u201d\nZhang Lei grinned. \u201cI could ping you a cargo float.\u201d\nShe laughed and took his arm.\nThe roadside floating lights winked on, turning their route into a tunnel of light snaking up the mountainside. When they got to the village center, night had fallen. The courtyard was lit with flaming torches and in the middle of the crowd, a bonfire blazed, sending up a column of sparks to search the sky. Faces flickered with shadows. Silver glinted and gleamed. Laughter pealed. A singer wailed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when I last smelled something burning,\u201d said Han Song.\n\u201cIs that what the stench is?\u201d asked Paul.\n\u201cWood smoke is the most beautiful scent,\u201d said Prajapati. \u201cPrimal.\u201d\nMost of the guests stayed on the courtyard\u2019s edge. They joined a group under the mulberry tree, a gender-free triad of performance artists from Cusco Hab. Zhang Lei had seen them around the village. They always looked like they were in a meeting\u2014heads down, conferring, arguing, making notes.\n\u201cHave the daughters been set free yet?\u201d Han Song quipped. \u201cAsking for a friend.\u201d\nThe triad laughed.\n\u201cApparently it\u2019s only one daughter, and no, the ceremony hasn\u2019t begun yet,\u201d said Aiko, the tallest of the three.\n\u201cJust one girl?\u201d Zhang Lei said. \u201cThen what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\u201cShakespeare! One performer, one night only. The complete works.\u201d Aiko was obviously joking but their face was perfectly sober.\nPrajapati grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t tease the boy.\u201d\nAnother pair of artists joined them, a cellist from Zurich and an opera singer from Hokkaido. They seemed to know more about the festival than anyone else.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t catch much of the performance unless the girl throws the switch on her translation balloon,\u201d the cellist said in a low voice. \u201cThe one last year didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone told me they translate in Kala, for the tourists visiting from Danzhai Wanda Village,\u201d said Aiko.\n\u201cPaizuo is more traditional than Kala. Which is why we come here.\u201d The cellist shaded her eyes against the torches\u2019 flare and scanned the crowd.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better they don\u2019t translate,\u201d the opera singer said. \u201cWhat the girl says won\u2019t make sense if you don\u2019t know the context. It\u2019s more meaningful to watch the reactions of the Miao.\u201d\nWith so many people in the square, Zhang Lei could only catch glimpses of the action. He put his viewcatcher on full extension, sent it a meter overhead, and switched its mode to low lux. Much better. The musicians were at the far end of the courtyard, near the bridge, playing drums and tall, upright bamboo flutes. The singer stood with them, wearing her silver headdress like a crown. Jen Dang and his family didn\u2019t seem to be around. But he spotted the girl\u2014the one who was being set free. She was alone. No friends, no fussing parents, no little siblings hanging on her arms.\nShe wore hoops of silver chain around her torque, a blue blouse and short black skirt embroidered with butterflies, and a woven sash around her waist. A deep red flower pierced her topknot. Her hands rested at her sides. She didn\u2019t pick at her nails or play with her jewelry like Lunite girls. She looked prepared, like a goalie in a crease, waiting for the game to begin.\nHe zoomed in on her face. His age or a little younger. Pretty, like all the Miao girls. Tough, too. What would a girl like her think of him?\nNot much, he suspected.\nThe music stopped, the crowd hushed. The girl\u2019s lips thinned in concentration. She stepped toward the bonfire and the circle of elders welcomed her into their arms. No drums this time, no bamboo flutes, no practiced wail from a powerful throat. The elders sang softly, their song a hum in the night, drowning under the buzz of the cicadas and crickets.\nNear the artists at the back of the crowd stood a mother with a baby clutched to her chest. She wore little silver, and looked upset.\n\u201cPoor thing,\u201d said Prajapati.\nThe woman scowled at her and made a hushing motion.\nZhang Lei waited for something to happen, some reason why the Miao were paying such close attention. The girl wasn\u2019t doing anything, just standing in the circle of softly singing elders, eyes closed, face tight with concentration. Maybe nothing would happen\u2014that was the point? Perhaps it was a test of her patience. It certainly was a test of his.\nAs he was considering sneaking away, the girl began singing along. Her voice was high, with an eerie overtone that pierced the sky. She sang higher and higher, drowning out the elders\u2019 voices. The Miao were rapt, breathless. When she spoke\u2014loud as if amplified\u2014the crowd exhaled a collective sigh of wonder.\n\u201cNo translation balloon,\u201d Aiko breathed. \u201cDamn.\u201d\nZhang Lei expected the crying mother to turn and scold them again, but she was pushing through the crowd, sobbing and holding her baby out like an offering.\n\u201cMust be her dead husband,\u201d said the cellist, quietly. \u201cYou see? They set the girl\u2019s soul free to visit the spirits, and now she\u2019s bringing messages back.\u201d\n\u201cMessages?\u201d said Zhang Lei. \u201cWhat kind of messages?\u201d\n\u201cEvery kind. Instructions. Admonitions. Warnings. Blessings. What kind of messages would you send from beyond if you could?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe something the girl could easily guess?\u201d said Han Song.\n\u201cHush,\u201d said Prajapati. \u201cThis is serious.\u201d\nIt was serious. Zhang Lei didn\u2019t even have to look up to know the new moon was watching him, the lights of its habs inscribed like a curse on the sunless black disc punched through the middle of the Milky Way.\nOn Luna, hockey was a blood sport. Lunar hockey was played at one-sixth gravity on a curved surface, with a Stefoff field to keep the puck low and snap players back to the ice. One of the major defensive moves was to disable the other team\u2019s players. Clubbing with weighted carbon fiber hockey sticks resulted in a penalty, though all referees were selectively blind. Slashing with skate blades, however, was a power move. An overdominant team could cut their way through their opponents\u2019 starting lineup, into the benched players and fourth-rates, and by the end of the fourth quarter stage an assault on an undefended goalie.\nDeaths were rare. Heads, legs, torsos, and groins were armored. Arms and throats were not. Medical bots hovered over the ice, ready to swoop in for first response, but rookies from the cr\u00e8ches quickly picked up scars, even playing in the recreational leagues. Anyone who remained unscarred was either a goalie or a coward.\nZhang Lei\u2019s cr\u00e8che manager had tried to do right by him, direct his talents so he\u2019d have choices when he left the cr\u00e8che. She nurtured his talent for drawing and painting as much as possible. But she was practical, too. Luna had far more professional hockey teams than artist collectives. All her children were on skates as soon as they could walk.\nWith powerful legs and a low center of gravity, Zhang Lei could take a hit and keep his speed. He could jump, spin, and kick. He could slice an opposing defenseman\u2019s brachial artery, drag his stick through the spurting blood, and spray the goalie as he slid the puck into the net. The fans loved him for it. His teammates too.\nIt made him a target, though. He spent more time on the bench than anyone else on the team, healing wounds on his forearms. No matter. The downtime gave him the opportunity to perfect the rarest of plays\u2014jump and spin high enough to slice a blade through an opponent\u2019s throat. He practiced it, talked about it, drew cartoons of it. He gave up goals attempting it, which got him a faceful of spittle whenever Coach chewed him out.\nThen finally he did it.\nDorgon wasn\u2019t even Zhang Lei\u2019s favorite proposed target. He was just a young, heavy-duty defenseman with a loud mouth who wasn\u2019t scared of Zhang Lei\u2019s flying blades.\nHe should have been.\nDorgon bled out in ten seconds. The medbot wrapped him in a life support bubble and attempted a transfusion right there on the ice, but stumbled over the thick scars on the defenseman\u2019s arms. When it searched for alternate access, Dorgon\u2019s coach was too busy screaming at Zhang Lei to flip the master toggle on his player\u2019s armor.\nWhose fault was it, then, that Dorgon died?\n\u201cYour fault, Zhang Lei,\u201d the Miao girl said. \u201cYou opened a mouth in my throat and my whole life came pouring out.\u201d\nShe pointed to him, standing under the mulberry tree with the other guests. Heads turned. He should have ran but he was frozen, breathless as if in a vacuum. He might have collapsed without the tree trunk behind him.\nMarta? he whispered. Help.\nNo answer. Prajapati grabbed his arm.\n\u201cIgnore her, it\u2019s a trick,\u201d she said. And then louder: \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d\nThe crowd parted to allow the girl a clear sight of him.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere you can go that I won\u2019t follow. I\u2019m inside your mattress when you sleep. Behind the door of your room, inside the closet. When you painted the Sklad arena, who do you think put the blood on the canvas? It was me.\u201d\nShe raised her fists and swung them toward him, as if shooting a puck with a phantom hockey stick.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fair game.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s head snapped back. She coughed once, and began speaking her native language again. The crowd turned away.\nMarta? Answer me.\nPrajapati tugged on his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Walk me home. We\u2019ll take the shortcut.\u201d\nShe took his arm again, pretending to need it for balance on the rocky path, but in truth she was holding him up. Han Song and Paul trailed behind, talking in low voices.\nMarta? Marta!\nShe answered before they got to top of the ridge.\nSorry, kid. I was in a closed-session meeting. Total privacy veil.\nAre they coming for me?\nWhat? No. Is there a problem in Paizuo?\nZhang Lei groaned. Prajapati looked at him sharply. Worry lines creased her plump face.\nThey know who I am. What I did.\nWho knows?\nEveryone. And all their relatives. From all over. Dorgon told them.\nThat\u2019s impossible.\nHe grabbed his viewcatcher, pinched off the last ten minutes of data, and fired it to her.\nWatch this.\nThe path descending the ridge was treacherous, lit by nothing but stars. If he\u2019d been alone, Zhang Lei would have ran down the ridge. If he fell and broke his neck, he deserved it. But the oldsters needed his help.\nHe took Prajapati\u2019s hand\u2014warm, dry, strong\u2014and used the fill flash on his viewcatcher to light each step while Han Song shone the brighter light from his camera down the trail. The two oldster men helped steady each other, Paul\u2019s hand on the photographer\u2019s shoulder. When Han Song slipped, Paul caught him by the elbow.\nYeah, okay, Marta whispered. Someone figured out who you are and told the girl. I\u2019ll talk to the security team. Don\u2019t do anything stupid, okay? We\u2019re on this.\nWhen they got to the studio, Paul fetched a bottle of whiskey from his room. He poured four glasses and handed the largest one to Zhang Lei.\n\u201cI found the news feed from Luna a couple days ago,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\u201cI found the painting,\u201d said Prajapati. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for it, but the sofa was in the wrong place. I showed it to Paul and Han Song. It\u2019s effective work, Zhang Lei. Palpable anguish.\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to keep something private,\u201d said Han Song, \u201cdon\u2019t put it in the common areas.\u201d\n\u201cNone of us told anyone,\u201d Prajapati added.\n\u201cSo, how did the story get to the Miao girl?\u201d Paul asked. The other two oldsters shook their heads.\n\u201cJen Dla?\u201d Han Song ventured.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask her in the morning.\u201d Prajapati patted Zhang Lei\u2019s knee. \u201cTry to get some sleep.\u201d\nThe whiskey burned Zhang Lei\u2019s throat and filled his sinuses with the scent of bonfire. What kind of messages would you send from beyond if you could? Vengeance. Dorgon had watched and waited for his opportunity. The news would travel fast. Brawler teams were searching the county for him.\nZhang Lei poured the rest of the whiskey down his throat.\n\u201cWhen they come for me, keep hitting my disable button,\u201d he said.\nThe three oldsters exchanged confused looks. A whirring sweeper bot bumped Zhang Lei\u2019s foot. He nudged it away with his toe and headed for the stairs.\nDon\u2019t be so dramatic, Marta whispered.\n\u201cWhen who comes for you?\u201d Prajapati asked.\n\u201cLet them do whatever they want to me,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t put yourself in danger. But if you can, keep knocking me out. Please.\u201d\nMarta sighed. Honestly.\nYou, too. Keep hitting the button. Whatever they do to me, I don\u2019t want to know about it.\nHe climbed the stairs two at a time. If his life was about to be crushed under the boots of a Lunite brawler gang, there was only one thing he wanted to do.\nThe scarred face of the new moon glared through the high windows of the communal studio. Zhang Lei chose the largest of his prepared canvases and flipped through his viewcatcher compositions. The water buffalo lying in the stream. Jen Dang catching a fish. Ripening rice terraces under golden mist. Jen Dla carrying a pot of sour fish soup, a lock of hair stuck to the sweat of her brow.\nThe fighting cocks in their cages, separated by the corner of a house, their torn flesh healing only to be sliced open another day.\nHe flipped the canvas to rest on the long side and projected the composition on its surface. How to make the three-dimensionality of the scene clear in two dimensions\u2014that was the main problem. Each cock knew the other was just out of sight. If they could get free, they would fight to the death.\nIt\u2019s in their nature, he whispered.\nWhat nature? Marta asked. Oh, I see. Are you going to paint all night?\nI\u2019ll paint for the rest of my life.\nOkay, ping me if there\u2019s a problem.\nFirst, he drafted with a light pencil, adjusting the composition. The corner of the house dividing the canvas into thirds, with one caged brawler directly in front of the viewer and the other around the corner. It was a difficult compositional problem\u2014he had to rub out the draft several times and start again. Then he began a base layer in grays, very lean and thin. What the old masters called en grisaille. Solve the painting problems in monochrome before even thinking about color. The texture of the wooden walls of the house, the figures of the birds filling the canvas with belligerence. It took all night.\nA few hours before dawn, Han Song brought him a cup of tea.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said, squinting at the canvas. \u201cI\u2019ve got some pictures of those birds, too.\u201d He settled at his workstation and sipped his own tea as he ruffled through his files. \u201cYou can use them for reference if you want.\u201d\nA package hit Zhang Lei\u2019s message queue\u2014the only communication he\u2019d received since leaving Luna that didn\u2019t relate to his immigration status. The photos were good. Details of the cocks\u2019 livid faces and dinosaurian legs, the pinfeathers sprouting from their bald backs, the iridescent sheen of their ruffs.\nHe added crimson and madder to his palette and used Han Song\u2019s photo of the cock\u2019s flayed wattle to get that detail exactly right, then moved on to the next problem. He thinned the paint with solvent to make a glaze. No time to wait for fat oils to oxidize, for thick paint layers to cure. In places, the paint was so thin the texture of the canvas showed through. That was fine. He would never be a master painter, but this would be the best painting he could make.\nHis friend\u2019s photos helped. Gradually, color and detail began to bring the painting to life.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Zhang Lei said, hours later. Han Song didn\u2019t hear him. Prajapati smiled from across the studio, her hands caked with clay to the elbow.\n\u201cDon\u2019t skip lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cEven painters need to eat.\u201d\n\u201cAnd sleep,\u201d Paul added.\nSleep. He had no time for it. And Dorgon was in his mattress, behind his door, in his closet. He would join Dorgon soon enough, and next year, when Paizuo\u2019s rice crop had turned yellow, they could scream public challenges at each other through a Miao girl.\nUntil then, there was only the work. Work like he\u2019d never known before. As an athlete, he practiced until instinct overtook his mind. On the ice, he didn\u2019t think, he just performed. In the studio, he used his whole body\u2014crouching, stretching, sweeping his arms\u2014continuing the action of his brush far off the canvas like a fighter following a punch past his opponent\u2019s jaw. And then small, precise movements\u2014careful, considered, even loving. But his intellect never disengaged. He made choices, second-guessed himself, took leaps of faith.\nIt was the most exhausting, engrossing work he\u2019d ever done.\nThe eye of the cock flared on the canvas, trapped in the pointlessness of its drive to fight and fight and die. Zhang Lei hovered his brush over that eye. One more glaze of color, and another, and another, over and over until nobody looking at the painting could misunderstand the meaning of that vicious and brainless stare.\nPaul put his arm around Zhang Lei\u2019s shoulders.\n\u201cCome on down to lunch. The painting is done. If you keep poking, you\u2019ll ruin it.\u201d\n\u201cRuin yourself, too,\u201d said Han Song.\n\u201cHe\u2019s young, he can take it,\u201d said Prajapati.\nThey fed him rice and egg, bitter green tea, and millet cake. No fish soup. No Jen Dla.\n\u201cShe\u2019s giving birth,\u201d Prajapati explained. \u201cWent into labor last night. Brave woman.\u201d\n\u201cWe should break out Paul\u2019s whiskey again,\u201d said Han Song. \u201cDrink a toast to her.\u201d\nPaul laughed. \u201cMaybe. We have something else to celebrate, too.\u201d\nThey all looked at Zhang Lei. His mouth was crammed with millet cake.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. What?\u201d he said though the cake.\n\u201cYour button is gone, dear,\u201d Prajapati said gently.\nHe swallowed, pinged his ID. Zhang Lei, Beijing resident. No caveats, no equivocations. And no button.\nMarta, he whispered. Is it done?\nThe notice has been sitting in your queue for half an hour. I pinged you when it came through. Looked like you were too busy painting birds to notice.\nAre the brawlers gone? he whispered.\nThey\u2019re on their way home. They can\u2019t touch you now and they know it. I don\u2019t recommend going to Luna anytime soon, but if you did and there was a problem, at least you could fight back.\nZhang Lei excused himself from the table and stumbled out of the guest house. He skirted the cabbage patch and followed the trail to the pavilion, with its perfectly composed view. Up and down the valley, farmers walked the terraces, examining the ripening rice.\nHow? You said it would be weeks, at least. Maybe never.\nI took your painting directly to the tribunal.\nThat made no sense. His painting was upstairs in the studio, on his easel.\nThey were impressed, Marta added. So was I.\nI don\u2019t understand.\nThe wet blood. Smart move. Visceral. The tribunal got the message.\nBlood?\nOn the ice. They brought in a forensic expert to examine and sequence it. That gave me a scare because I had assumed the blood was yours. Didn\u2019t even occur to me it might be somebody else\u2019s. If it had been, things wouldn\u2019t have turned out so well.\nMy blood?\nI guess the tribunal wanted to be convinced you regretted killing Dorgon.\nZhang Lei leaned on the pavilion railing. A fresh breeze ruffled his hair.\nI do regret it.\nThey know that now. I\u2019ll keep the painting for you until you get a place of your own. So keep in touch, okay?\nI will, he whispered.\nOn the terrace below, Jen Dang walked along the rice paddy with four of his grandchildren. The farmer waved. Zhang Lei waved back.\nThe author acknowledges the generous support of the Future Affairs Administration and Danzhai SF Camp.\nKelly Robson's short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Tor.com, Asimov's Science Fiction, and multiple year's best anthologies.

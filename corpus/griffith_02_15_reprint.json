The music was winding down. Richard and Cody (whose real name was Candice, though no one she had met since high school knew it) lived on different coasts, but tonight was the third time this year they had been drinking together. Cody was staring at the shadows gathering in the corners of the bar and trying not to think about her impersonal hotel room. She thought instead of the fact that in the last six months she had seen Richard more often than some of her friends in San Francisco, and that she would probably see him yet again in a few weeks when their respective companies bid on the Atlanta contract.\n She said, \u201cYou ever wonder what it would be like to have, you know, a normal type job, where you get up on Monday and drive to work, and do the same thing Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday, every week, except when you take a vacation?\u201d\n \u201cYou forgot Friday.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d They had started on mojitos, escalated through James Bonds, and were now on a tequila-shooter-with-draft-chaser glide path.\n \u201cI said, you forgot Friday. Monday, Tuesday\u2014\u201d\n \u201cRight,\u201d Cody said. \u201cRight. Too many fucking details. But did you ever wonder? About a normal life?\u201d An actual life, in one city, with actual friends.\n Richard was silent long enough for Cody to lever herself around on the bar stool and look at him. He was playing with his empty glass. \u201cI just took a job,\u201d he said. \u201cA no-travel job.\u201d\n \u201cAh, shit.\u201d\n They had met, just after the first dotcom crash, at a graduate conference on synergies of bio-mechanics and expert decision-making software architecture or some such crap, which was wild because he started out in cognitive psychology and she in applied mathematics. But computers were the alien glue that made all kinds of odd limbs stick together and work in ways never intended by nature. Like Frankenstein\u2019s monster, he had said when she mentioned it, and she had bought him a drink, because he got it. They ran into each other at a similar conference two months later, then again at some industry junket not long after they\u2019d both joined social media startups. The pattern repeated itself, until, by the time they were both pitching venture capitalists at trade shows, they managed to get past the required cool, the distancing irony, and began to email each other beforehand to arrange dinners, drinks, tickets to the game. They were young, good-looking, and very, very smart. Even better, they had absolutely no romantic interest in each other.\n Now when they met it was while traveling as representatives of their credit-starved companies to make increasingly desperate pitches to industry-leading Goliaths on why they needed the nimble expertise of hungry Davids.\n Cody hadn\u2019t told Richard that lately her pitches had been more about why the Goliaths might find it cost effective to absorb the getting-desperate David she worked for, along with all its innovative, motivated, boot-strapping employees whose stock options and 401(k)s were now worthless. But a no-travel job meant only one thing, and going back to the groves of academe was really admitting failure.\n She sighed. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n \u201cChapel Hill. And it\u2019s not . . . Well, okay, it is sort of an academic job, but not really.\u201d\n \u201cUh-huh.\u201d\n \u201cNo, really. It\u2019s with a new company, a joint venture between WishtleNet and the University of North\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSee.\u201d\n \u201cJust let me finish.\u201d Richard could get very didactic when he\u2019d been drinking. \u201cThink Google Labs, or Xerox PARC, but wackier. Lots of money to play with, lots of smart grad students to do what I tell them, lots of blue sky research, not just irritating Vice Presidents saying I\u2019ve got six months to get the software on the market, even if it is garbage.\u201d\n \u201cI hear you on that.\u201d Except that Vince, Cody\u2019s COO, had told her that if she landed the Atlanta contract she would be made a VP herself.\n \u201cIt\u2019s cool stuff, Cody. All those things we\u2019ve talked about in the last six, seven years? The cognitive patterning and behavior mod, the modulated resonance imaging software, the intuitive learning algorithms\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014they want me to work on that. They want me to define new areas of interest. Very cool stuff.\u201d\n Cody just shook her head. Cool. Cool didn\u2019t remember to feed the fish when you were out of town, again.\n \u201cStarts next month,\u201d he said.\n Cody felt very tired. \u201cSo you won\u2019t be in Atlanta.\u201d\n \u201cNope.\u201d\n \u201cAtlanta in August. On my own. Jesus.\u201d\n \u201cOn your own? What about all those pretty girls in skimpy summer clothes?\u201d\n The muscles in Cody\u2019s eyebrows felt tight. She rubbed them. \u201cIt\u2019s Boone I\u2019m not looking forward to. Boone and his sleazy strip club games.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s the customer.\u201d\n \u201cYour sympathy\u2019s killing me.\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cI thought that lap-dancing hooker thing was your wet dream.\u201d\n Her head ached. Now he was going to bring up Dallas.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what you told us in\u2014now where the hell was that?\u201d\n \u201cDallas.\u201d Might as well get it over with.\n \u201cYou were really into it. Are you blushing?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Three years ago she had been twenty-eight with four million dollars in stock options and the belief that her coding cowboy colleagues were her friends. Ha. And now probably half the geeks in the South had heard about her most intimate fantasy. Including Boone.\n She swallowed the last of her tequila. Oily, ugly stuff once it got tepid. She picked up her jacket.\n \u201cI\u2019m out of here. Unless you have any handy hints about landing that contract without playing Boone\u2019s slimeball games? Didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She pushed her shot glass away and stood.\n \u201cThat Atlanta meeting\u2019s when? Eight, nine weeks?\u201d\n \u201cAbout that.\u201d She dropped two twenties on the bar.\n \u201cI maybe could help.\u201d\n \u201cWith Boone? Right.\u201d But Richard\u2019s usually cherubic face was quite stern.\n He fished his phone from his pocket and put it on the bar. He said, \u201cJust trust me for a minute,\u201d and tapped the memo icon. The icon winked red. \u201cWhatever happens, I promise no one will ever hear what goes on this recording except you.\u201d\n Cody slung on her jacket. \u201cCue ominous music.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s more an, um, an ethics thing.\u201d\n \u201cJesus, Richard. You\u2019re such a drama queen.\u201d But she caught the bartender\u2019s eye, pointed to their glasses, and sat.\n \u201cI did my Atlanta research too,\u201d he said. \u201cLike you, I\u2019m pretty sure what will happen after you\u2019ve made your presentations to Boone.\u201d\n \u201cThe Golden Key,\u201d she said, nodding. Common knowledge. The sun rises, the government taxes, Boone listens to bids and takes everyone to the Golden Key.\n \u201c\u2014but what I need to know from you is whether or not, to win this contract, you can authorize out-of-pocket expenses in the high five figures.\u201d\n She snorted. \u201cFive figures against a possible eight? What do you think?\u201d\n He pointed at the phone.\n \u201cFine. Yes. I can approve that kind of expense.\u201d\n He smiled, a very un-Richardlike sliding of muscle and bone, like a python disarticulating its jaw to swallow a pig. Cody nearly stood up, but the moment passed.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll also have to authorize me to access your medical records,\u201d he said.\n So here they were in Marietta, home of the kind of Georgians who wouldn\u2019t fuck a stranger in the woods only because they didn\u2019t know who his people were: seven men and one woman stepping from Boone\u2019s white concrete and green glass tower into an August sun hot enough to make the blacktop bubble. Boone\u2019s shades flashed as he turned to face the group.\n \u201cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. And Jill,\u201d with a nod at Cody, who nodded back and tried not to squint. Squinting made her look like a moron: not good when all around you were wearing sleek East Coast summer business clothes and gilded with Southern tans. At least the guy from Portland had forgotten his shades too.\n They moved in a small herd across the soft, sticky parking lot: the guy from Boston would have to throw away his fawn loafers.\n Boone said to the guy from Austin, \u201cDave, you take these three. I know you know where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n \u201cSure do,\u201d Dave said, and the seven boys shared that we\u2019re-all-men-of-the-world-yes-indeedy laugh. Cody missed Richard. And she was still pissed at the way he\u2019d dropped the news on her only last week. Why hadn\u2019t he told her earlier about not coming to Atlanta? Why hadn\u2019t he told her in Seattle? And a university job: what was up with that? Loser. But she wished he was here.\n Boone\u2019s car was a flashy Mercedes hybrid in silver. He opened the passenger door with a Yeah-I-know-men-and-women-are-equal-but-I-was-born-in-the-south-so-what-can-you-do? smile to which Cody responded with a perfect, ironic lift of both eyebrows. Hey, couldn\u2019t have managed that in shades. The New York guy and Boston loafers got in the back. The others were climbing into Dave\u2019s dark green rental SUV. A full-sized SUV. Very uncool. He\u2019d lose points for that. She jammed her seatbelt home with a satisfying click.\n As they drove to the club, she let the two in the back jostle for conversational space with Boone. She stared out of the window. The meeting had gone very well. It was clear that she and Dave and the guy from Denver were the only ones representing companies with the chops for this contract, and she was pretty sure she had the edge over the Denver people when it came to program rollout. Between her and Dave, then. If only they weren\u2019t going to the Golden Key. God. The thought of all those men watching her watch those women and think they knew what she was thinking made her scalp prickle with sweat. In the flow of conditioned air, her face turned cold.\n Two days before she left for Atlanta she\u2019d emailed Vince to explain that it wasn\u2019t her who would be uncomfortable at the strip club, but the men, and that he should at least consider giving Boone a call and setting her presentation up for either the day before or the day after the others. She\u2019d got a reply half an hour later, short and to the point: You\u2019re going, kid, end of story. She\u2019d taken a deep breath and walked over to his office.\n He was on the phone, pacing up and down, but waved her in before she could knock. He covered the receiver with one hand, \u201cGotta take this, won\u2019t be long,\u201d and went back to pacing, shouting, \u201cDamn it, Rick, I want it done. When we had that meeting last week you assured me\u2014 Yeah. No problem, you said. No fucking problem. So just do it, just find a way.\u201d He slammed the phone down, shook his head, turned his attention to her. \u201cCody, what can I do for you? If it\u2019s about this Atlanta thing I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d\n \u201cVince\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBoone\u2019s not stupid. He takes people to that titty club because he likes to watch how they behave under pressure. You\u2019re the best we\u2019ve got, you know that. Just be yourself and you won\u2019t fuck up. Give him good presentation and don\u2019t act like a Girl Scout when the nipples start to show. Can you handle that?\u201d\n \u201cI just resent\u2014\u201d\n \u201cJesus Christ, Cody. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never seen bare naked ladies before. You want to be a VP? Tell me now: yes or no.\u201d\n Cody took a breath. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cGlad to hear it. Now get out of here.\u201d\n The Golden Key was another world: cool, and scented with the fruity overtones of beer; loud, with enough bass to make the walls of her abdomen vibrate; dark at the edges, though lushly lit at the central stage with its three chrome poles and laser strobes. Only one woman was dancing. It was just after six, but the place was already half full. Somewhere, someone was smoking expensive cigars. Cody wondered who the club paid off to make that possible.\n Boone ordered staff to put two tables together right by the stage, near the center pole. The guy from New York sat on Boone\u2019s left, Dave on his right. Cody took a place at the end, out of Boone\u2019s peripheral vision. She wouldn\u2019t say or do anything that wasn\u2019t detached and ironic. She would be seamless.\n A new dancer: shoulder-length red hair that fell over her face as she writhed around the right hand pole. She wore a skirt the size of a belt, and six inch-heels of translucent plastic embedded with suggestive pink flowers. Without the pole she probably couldn\u2019t even stand. Did interesting things to her butt, though, Cody thought, then patted surreptitiously at her upper lip. Dry, thank god. Score one for air conditioning.\n New York poked her arm. He jerked his thumb at Boone, who leaned forward and shouted, \u201cWhat do you want to drink?\u201d\n \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n He grinned. \u201cNo grape juice playing at champagne here. Place takes its liquor seriously.\u201d\n Peachy. \u201cMargarita. With salt.\u201d If it was sour enough she wouldn\u2019t want to gulp it.\n The dancer hung upside down on the pole and undid her bra. Her breasts were a marvel of modern art, almost architectural.\n \u201cMy God,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s the Hagia Sophia.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d New York shouted. \u201cShe\u2019s called Sophia?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Cody shouted back, \u201cher breasts . . . Never mind.\u201d\n \u201cFakes,\u201d New York said, nodding.\n The drinks came, delivered by a blonde woman wearing nothing but a purple velvet G-string and a smile. She called Boone Darlin\u2019\u2014clearly he was a regular\u2014and Cody Sugar.\n Cody managed to lift her eyes from the weirdness of unpierced nipples long enough to find a dollar bill and drop it on the drinks tray. Two of the guys were threading their tips under the G-string: a five and a ten. The blonde dropped Cody a wink as she walked away. New York caught it and leered. Cody tried her margarita: very sour. She gulped anyway.\n The music changed to a throbbing remix of mom music: the Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cSlowhand.\u201d The bass line was insistent, pushing on her belly like a warm hand. She licked her lips and applied herself to her drink. Another dancer with soft black curls took the left hand pole, and the redhead moved to center stage on her hands and knees in front of their table, rotating her ass in slow motion, looking at them over her shoulder, slitting her eyes at them like a cat. Boone, Dave, all the guys had bills in their hands: \u201cOoh mama, I\u2019ve got what you need.\u201d The redhead backed towards them in slow motion, arching her spine now in apparent ecstasy\u2014but not so far gone as to ignore the largest bill at the table: Boone\u2019s twenty. She let him tease her with it, stroking up the inside of her thigh and circling a nipple, before she held out the waistband of the pseudo-skirt for the twenty. They probably didn\u2019t notice that she plucked them of their bills in order\u2014Boone\u2019s twenty, Dave\u2019s ten, the two fives. Then she was moving to her right, to a crowd of hipster suits who had obviously been there longer than was good for them: two of them were holding out fifties. The dancer pretended to fuck the fifty being held out at pelvis level. She had incredible muscle control. Next to Cody, New York swallowed hard, and fumbled for his wallet. But it was too late. The hipster was grinning hard as the redhead touched his cheek, tilted her head, said something. He stood and his friends hooted encouragement as he and the redhead disappeared through a heavily frosted glass door in the back.\n \u201cOh, man . . . \u201d Dave\u2019s face was more red than tan, now. He pulled a fifty from his wallet, snapped it, folded it lengthways, and held it out over the stage to the remaining dancer. \u201cYo, curlyhead, come and get some!\u201d\n \u201cYeah!\u201d said New York in a high voice. Portland and Boston seemed to be engaged in a drinking game.\n Boone caught Cody\u2019s eye and smiled slightly. She shrugged and spread her hand as if to say, Hey, it\u2019s their money to waste, and he smiled again, this time with a touch of skepticism. Ah, shit.\n \u201cSugar?\u201d The waitress with the velvet G-string, standing close and bending down so that her nipples brushed Cody\u2019s hair, then dabbed her cheek.\n Cody looked at her faded blue eyes and found a ten dollar bill. She smiled and slipped it into the G-string at the woman\u2019s hip and crooked a finger to make her bend close again.\n \u201cI\u2019d take it as a personal favor if you brought me another of these wonderful margaritas,\u201d she said in the woman\u2019s ear, \u201cwithout the tequila.\u201d\n \u201cWhatever you say. But I\u2019ll still have to charge for the liquor.\u201d\n \u201cOf course you do. Just make sure it looks good.\u201d Cody jerked her head back at the rest of the table.\n \u201cYou let me take care of everything, sugar. I\u2019m going to make you the meanest looking margarita in Dixie. They\u2019ll be amazed, purely amazed, at your stamina. It\u2019ll be our little secret.\u201d She fondled Cody\u2019s arm and shoulder, let the back of her hand brush the side of Cody\u2019s breast. \u201cMy name is Mimi. If you need anything, later.\u201d She gave Cody a molten look and headed for the bar. The skin on her rotating cheeks looked unnaturally smooth, like porcelain. Cosmetics, Cody decided.\n Curlyhead had spotted Dave\u2019s fifty and was now on her back in front of their table. Cody imagined her as a glitched wigglebot responding to insane commands: clench, release, arch, whip back and forth. Whoever had designed her had done a great job on those muscles: each distinct, plump with strength, soft to the touch. Shame they hadn\u2019t had much imagination with the facial expressions or managed to put any spark in the eyes.\n Breasts swaying near her face announced the arrival of her kickless drink. She slipped a ten from her wallet and reached for Mimi\u2019s G-string.\n Mimi stepped back half a pace, put her tray down, and squeezed her breasts together with her hands. \u201cWould you like to put it here instead, Sugar?\u201d\n Cody blinked.\n \u201cYou could slide it in real slow. Then maybe we could get better acquainted.\u201d But like the wigglebot, her eyes stayed blank.\n \u201cYou\u2019re too hot for me, Mimi.\u201d Cody snapped the bill into her G-string and tried not to feel Mimi\u2019s flash of hatred. She sipped her drink and took a discreet peek in her wallet. This was costing the company a fortune.\n Boone watched Dave and New York with a detached expression. Then he turned her way with a speculative look. An invitation to talk?\n She stood. And turned to look at the stage just as a long-haired woman in cowboy boots strode to the center pole.\n For Cookie it was all routine so far, ankle holding up better than she thought it might. The boots helped. She couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d written that note to herself, Cowboys and Indians! but it was going to be inspired. She flexed and bent and pouted and pointed her breasts on automatic pilot. Should she get the ankle X-rayed? Nah. It was only a sprain. Two ibuprofen and some ice would fix it.\n Decent crowd for a Tuesday night. Some high spenders behind the pillar there, but Ginger had taken them for four lapdances already. Well, hey, there were always more men with more money than sense. She glanced into the wings. Danny had her hat. He nodded. She moved automatically, counted under her breath, and just as the first haunting whistle of Morricone\u2019s \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\u201d soundtrack echoed from the speakers she held out her hand, caught the hat, and swept it onto her head. Ooh, baby, perfect today, perfect. She smiled and strutted downstage. A woman at the front table was standing. Cookie saw the flash of a very expensive watch, and for no particular reason was flooded with conviction that tonight was going to go very well indeed. Cookie, baby, she told herself, tonight you\u2019re gonna get rich.\n And with that catch of the hat, that strut, just like that, Cody forgot about Boone and his contract, forgot about being seamless, forgot everything. The dancer was fine, lean and soft, strong as a deer. The name Cookie was picked out in rhinestones on her hat, and she wore a tiny fringed buckskin halter and something that looked like a breechclout\u2014flaps of suede that hung from the waist to cover front and back, but not the sides\u2014and wicked spurs on the boots. She looked right at Cody and smiled, and her eyes were not blank.\n Part of Cody knew that Boone had seen her stand, and was now watching her watch this dancer, and that she should stop, or sit, or keep walking to Boone\u2019s end of the table, but the other part\u2014the part that liked to drink shots in biker bars, to code all night with Acid Girls pounding from the speakers and the company\u2019s fortunes riding on her deadline, the part that had loaded up her pickup and left Florida to drive all the way to the West Coast on her own when she was just nineteen, that had once hung by her knees from a ninth floor balcony just because she could\u2014that part cared about nothing but this woman with the long brown hair.\n The hair was Indian straight and ended just one inch above the hem of the breechclout, and the way she moved made Cody understand that the hat and spurs were trophies, taken from a dead man. When the dancer trailed her hands across her body, Cody knew they held knives. When the male voices began their rhythmic chanting, she could see this woman riding hard over the plain, vaulting from her pony, stripping naked as she walked.\n The music shifted but again it was drums, and now Cookie swayed like a maiden by a pool, pulling the straps of her halter off her shoulders, enough to expose half her breasts but not all, and she felt them thoughtfully, and began to smear them with warpaint. When she had painted all she could see, she pushed the buckskin down further, so that each breast rested like a satsuma on its soft shelf, then she turned her back on the audience, twisted her hair over one shoulder and examined the reflection of her ass in the water. She turned a little, this way and that, lifting the back flap, one corner then another, dropping it, thinking, stroking each cheek experimentally, trying to decide how to decorate it. Then she smoothed the buckskin with both hands so it pulled tight, and studied that effect. She frowned. She traced the outline of her G-string with her index finger. She smiled. She stuck her butt out, twitched it a couple of times, hooked both thumbs in the waistband of her G-string, and whipped it off. The breechclout stayed in place. She was still wearing the halter under her breasts.\n And the little dyke liked that, Cookie could tell. She smiled smooth as cream, danced closer, saw the stain creeping up the woman\u2019s cheeks, the way her lips parted and her hands opened. Professionally manicured hands; clothes of beautifully cut linen, shoes handmade. The men in the room faded to irritation. This was the prize.\n One of the men at the table reached out and slipped a twenty between the rawhide tie of her breechclout and her hip, but Cookie barely took her eyes from the woman. Twenty here or fifty there was small change compared to this. For you, she mouthed and turned slightly, and tightened down into a mushroom of skin-sheathed muscle, took off her hat, and reached back and pulled the flap of her breechclout out of the way.\n She was aware of some shouting, the tall guy with the red face and the fifty but she kept her eyes fixed on the woman.\n And then the music changed, and Ginger was back from her lapdance, and she saw Christie was hand in hand with a glazed-looking mark, about to leave for the backroom, and it was time for her to put some of her clothes back on and work the floor.\n Five minutes, she mouthed to the woman.\n Cookie, Cody thought, as the dancer flicked the suede flap back in place, stood gracefully, and put her hat back on. Cookie. She watched as Cookie left the stage and took all the heat and light with her. She would come back, wouldn\u2019t she? Five minutes, she had said.\n \u201cCunt!\u201d Dave shouted again, \u201cmy money not good enough for you? Goddamned\u2014 No, you get off of me.\u201d He pushed Boone\u2019s hand from his arm, then realized what he\u2019d done. \u201cShit. That\u2019s\u2014 It\u2019s just\u2014 You know how it is, man. But fifty bucks . . . \u201d\n \u201cHell, Dave, maybe she knew it was counterfeit,\u201d Boone said jovially.\n Dave forced a laugh, thrust the bill in his pocket. \u201cYeah, or maybe she just doesn\u2019t understand size matters.\u201d Boone laughed, but everyone at the table heard the dismissive note.\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to call it a night, folks.\u201d\n But Cody wasn\u2019t listening because Cookie was standing before her: no hat, buckskins and G-string back in place.\n \u201cOkay guys, looks like we lost Cody.\u201d Boone laughed, nothing like the laugh he\u2019d given Dave. \u201cHey, girl, you make sure you get a cab home, hear? Mention my name to the doorman. Come on guys, we\u2019re outta here.\u201d\n \u201cCody. Is that your name?\u201d said Cookie, and took her hand. Cody nodded dumbly. \u201cI\u2019m Cookie. It\u2019s so good to find another woman here.\u201d\n Another nod. How are you? Cody wanted to say, but that made no sense.\n \u201cWould you like to dance with me? Just you and me in private?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019d have to pay for the room.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI love dancing for women. It gets me going, turns me on. I understand what women want, Cody. Would you like me to show you?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Cody, and was mildly amazed when her legs worked well enough to follow Cookie to the frosted glass door.\n Midnight in her hotel room. Cody sat on the bed, naked, too wired to lie down. Streetlight slanted through the unclosed drapes, turning the room sodium yellow. The air conditioning roared, but her skin burned. Cookie. Cookie\u2019s lips, Cookie\u2019s hips, Cookie\u2019s cheek and chin and belly. Her thighs and ass and breasts. Oh, her breasts, their soft weight on Cody\u2019s palms.\n She lifted her hands, turned her palms up, examined them. They didn\u2019t look any different. She unsnapped her watch rubbed her wrist absently. Cookie.\n Stop it. What the fuck was the matter with her? She\u2019d gone to a strip club and had sex for money. It was a first, okay, so some confusion was to be expected, but it was sordid, not romantic. She had been played by an expert and taken for hundreds of dollars. Oh, God, and Boone . . . She had made a fucking fool of herself.\n So why did she feel so happy?\n Cody, you\u2019re so beautiful, she\u2019d said. Oh, yes, yes, don\u2019t stop, Cody. Give it to me, give me all of it. And Cody had. And Cookie had . . . Cookie had been perfect. She had understood everything, anticipated everything. What to say, what to do, when to cajole and goad, when to smile and be submissive, when to encourage, when to resist. Like a mind reader. And she had felt something, Cody knew it. She had. You couldn\u2019t fake pupil dilation, you couldn\u2019t fake that flush, you couldn\u2019t fake that sheen of sweat and luxuriant slipperiness. Could you?\n Christ. She going mad. She rubbed her eyebrows. Cookie was a pro, and none of it was real.\n She got up. The woolen carpet made her bare feet itch. That was real. Her clothes were flung across the back of the chair by the desk; they reeked of cigar smoke. No great loss. She\u2019d no idea why she\u2019d chosen to wear those loose pants, anyway. Hadn\u2019t worn them for about a year. Hadn\u2019t worn that stupid watch for about as long, come to think of it. Cookie hated the smell of cigars, she\u2019s said so, when she was unbuttoning\u2014\n Stop it. Stop it now.\n She carried her pants to the bed and pulled the receipts from the pockets. Eight of them. She\u2019d paid for eight lapdances, and the size of the tips . . . Jesus. That was two month\u2019s rent. What had she been thinking?\n We have to pay for the room, Cookie said, but I\u2019ll pay you half back. It\u2019s just that I can\u2019t wait. Oh, please, Cody. I want you again.\n \u201cGod damn it!\u201d Her ferocity scared her momentarily and she stilled, listening. No stirrings or mutterings from either room next door.\n Give me your hotel phone number, Cookie had said. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow. This has never happened before. This is real.\n And if it was . . . She could reschedule her flight. She\u2019d explain it to Vince somehow.\n Christ. That huge contract gone, in a flash of lust. Vince would kill her.\n But, oh, she\u2019d had nearly three hours of the best sex she\u2019d ever had. It had gone exactly the way she\u2019d imagined it in her fantasies. I know just what you want, Cookie had said, and proved it.\n But Cody had known too, that was the thing. She had known when the hoarse breath and clutching hands meant it was Cookie\u2019s turn, meant that Cookie now wanted to be touched, wanted to break every single personal and club rule and be fucked over the back of the chair, just for pleasure.\n Cody stirred the receipts. She couldn\u2019t make it make sense. She had paid for sex. That was not romance. But she had felt Cookie\u2019s vaginal muscles tighten, felt that quiver in her perineum, the clutch and spasm of orgasm. It wasn\u2019t faked. It hadn\u2019t been faked the second time, either.\n Cody shivered. The air conditioning was finally beginning to bite. She rubbed her cold feet. Cookie\u2019s feet were long and shapely, each toe painted with clear nail polish. She\u2019d twisted her ankle, she\u2019d said. Cody had held the ankle, kissed it, stroked it. Cookie\u2019s smile was beautiful. How did you sprain it? Cody had asked, and Cookie had told her about falling five feet from the indoor climbing wall, and they had talked about climbing and rafting, and Cody had told her of the time when she was seven and had seen Cirque de Soleil and wanted to be one of the trapeze artists, and that led to talk of abdominal muscles, which led to more sex.\n She padded into the bathroom, still without bothering with the light. When she lifted her toothbrush to her mouth, the scent on her fingers tightened her muscles involuntarily. She dropped the toothbrush, leaned over the sink, and wept.\n A blue, blue Atlanta morning. Cody hadn\u2019t slept. She didn\u2019t want breakfast. Her plane wasn\u2019t until four that afternoon.\n She\u2019d lost the contract, lost a night\u2019s sleep, lost her mind and her self-respect, and flushed two months\u2019 rent down the toilet. She would never see Cookie again\u2014and she couldn\u2019t understand why she cared.\n The phone rang. Cookie! she thought, and hated herself for it.\n \u201cHello?\u201d\n \u201cYour cell phone\u2019s off, but I called Vince back in Frisco and he told me you were at the Westin.\u201d\n Boone. She shut her eyes.\n \u201cPlane\u2019s not til four, am I right? Cody, you there?\u201d\n \u201cYes. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re not too tuckered out, maybe you wouldn\u2019t mind dropping by my office. We\u2019ll give you lunch.\u201d\n \u201cLunch?\u201d\n \u201cYep. You know, food. Don\u2019t they do lunch on the West Coast?\u201d\n \u201cYes. I mean, why?\u201d\n He chuckled. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve got a few details to hammer out on this contract. So should we say, oh, eleven-thirty?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s, yes, fine. Good,\u201d she said at random, and put the phone down.\n She stared at her bag. Clothes. She\u2019d need to change her clothes. Was he really giving her the contract?\n The phone rang again. \u201cHello?\u201d she said doubtfully, expecting anyone from god to the devil to reply.\n \u201cHey, Cody. It\u2019s me.\u201d\n \u201cRichard?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Listen, how did it go?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t . . . Things are . . . \u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI got the contract.\u201d\n \u201cHey, that\u2019s great. But how did last night go?\u201d\n \u201cChrist Richard, I can\u2019t gossip now. I don\u2019t have the time. I\u2019m on my way to Boone\u2019s, iron out a few details.\u201d She had to pull it together. \u201cI\u2019ll call you in a week or two, okay?\u201d\n \u201cNo, wait, Cody. Just don\u2019t do anything you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLater, okay.\u201d She dropped the phone in its cradle. How did he know to call the Westin? What did he care about her night? She rubbed her forehead again. Food might help with the contract. The headache, she meant. And she grinned: the contract. She\u2019d goddamned well won the contract. She was gonna get a huge bonus. She was gonna be a Vice President. She was gonna be late.\n In the bathroom, she picked up the toothbrush, rinsed off the smeared paste, and resolutely refused to think about last night. Cookie dialed the hotel.\n \u201cThis is Cody. Leave a message, or reach me on my cell phone,\u201d followed by a string of numbers beginning with 216. San Francisco. That\u2019s right. She\u2019d told Cookie that last night: San Francisco with its fog and hills and great espresso on Sunday mornings.\n That might be okay. Anything would beat this Atlanta heat.\n Boone didn\u2019t want to talk details so much as to laugh and drink coffee and teach Cody how to eat a po\u2019 boy sandwich. After all, if they were gonna be working together, they should get to know each other, was he right? And there was no mention of strip clubs or lapdances until the end when he signed the letter of intent, handed it to her, and said, \u201cI like the way you handle yourself. Now take that Austin fella, Dave. No breeding. Can\u2019t hold his liquor, can\u2019t keep his temper, and calls a woman names in public. But you: no boasting, no big words, you just sit quiet then seize the opportunity.\u201d He gave her a sly smile. \u201cYou do that in business and we\u2019ll make ourselves some money.\u201d\n And somehow, with his clap on the back, the letter in her laptop case and the sun on her face while she waited for the car for her trip to the airport, she started to forget her confusion. She\u2019d had great sex, she\u2019d built the foundations of a profitable working relationship, she was thirty-one and about to be a vice president, and she didn\u2019t even have a hangover.\n The car came and she climbed into the cool, green-tinted interior.\n She let the outside world glide by for ten minutes before she got out the letter of intent. She read it twice. Beautifully phrased. Strong signature. Wonderful row of zeroes before the decimal point. If everything stayed on track, this one contract would keep their heads above water until they could develop a few more income streams. And she had done it. No one else. Damn she was good! Someone should buy her a great dinner to celebrate.\n She got out her phone, turned it on. The signal meter wavered as the car crossed from cell to cell. Who should she call? No one in their right mind would want to have dinner with Vince. Richard would only want all the details, and she didn\u2019t want to talk about those details yet; he was in the Carolinas, anyway. Asshole.\n The signal suddenly cleared, and her phone bleeped: one message.\n \u201cHey. This is Cookie. I know you don\u2019t go until the afternoon. If you . . . I know this is weird but last night was . . . Shit. Look, maybe you won\u2019t believe me but I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I want to see you, okay? I\u2019ll be in the park, the one I told you about. Piedmont. On one of the benches by the lake. I\u2019m going there now, and I\u2019ll wait. I hope you come. I\u2019ll bring doughnuts. Do you like doughnuts? I\u2019ll be waiting. Please.\u201d\n Oooh, you\u2019re different, ooh, you\u2019re so special, ooh, give it to me baby, just pay another thousand dollars and I\u2019ll love you forever. Sure. But Cookie\u2019s voice sounded so soft, so uncertain, as though she really meant it. But of course it would. That was her living: playing pretend. Using people.\n Cody\u2019s face prickled. Be honest, she told herself: who really used who, here? Who got the big contract, who got to have exactly what she wanted: great sex with no complications, and on the expense account no less?\n It was too confusing. She was too tired. She was leaving. It was all too late anyhow, she thought, as the car moved smoothly onto the interstate.\n A woman sitting on her own on a bench, maybe getting hot, maybe getting thirsty, wanting to use the bathroom. Afraid to get up and go pee because she might miss the one she was waiting for. Maybe the hot sweet scent of the doughnuts reminded her she was hungry, but she wouldn\u2019t eat them because she wanted to present them in their round-dozen perfection to her sweetie, see her smile of delight. She would pick at the paint peeling on the wooden bench and look up every time someone like Cody walked past; every time, she\u2019d be disappointed. This one magical thing had happened in her life, something very like a miracle, but as the hot fat sun sinks lower she understands that this miracle, this dream is going to die because the person she\u2019s resting all her hopes on is worried she might look like a fool. Or doesn\u2019t want to admit she had used a woman for sex then thrown her away.\n Cody blinked, looked at her watch. She leaned forward, cleared her throat.\n The driver looked at her in his mirror. \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d\n \u201cWhere is Piedmont park?\u201d\n \u201cNortheast of downtown.\u201d\n \u201cDo we pass it on the way to the airport?\u201d\n \u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n She was crazy. But all that waited for her at home was a tankful of fish. \u201cTake me there.\u201d\n Without the hat and boots, wearing jeans and sandals and the kind of tank top Cody herself might have picked, Cookie looked young. So did her body language. Her hair was in a braid. She was flipping it from shoulder to shoulder, twisting on the bench to look to one side, behind her, the other side. When she saw Cody, her face opened in a big smile that was naked and utterly vulnerable.\n \u201cHow old are you?\u201d Cody blurted.\n The face closed. \u201cTwenty-six. How old are you?\u201d\n \u201cThirty-one.\u201d Cody didn\u2019t sit down.\n They stared at each other. \u201cDirt on my face?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Sorry. It looks . . . you look different.\u201d\n \u201cYou expect me to dress like that on my day off, too?\u201d\n \u201cNo! No.\u201d But part of her had. \u201cSo. You get a lot of days off?\u201d\n A short laugh. \u201cCan\u2019t afford it. No expense accounts for me. No insurance, no 401(k), no paid vacation.\u201d\n Cody flushed. \u201cEarning two thousand bucks a night isn\u2019t exactly a hard luck story.\u201d\n \u201cWas I worth it?\u201d\n Her smell filled Cody\u2019s mouth. Yes! she wanted to shout. Yes, a hundred times over. But that made no sense, so she just stood there.\n \u201cYou paid twenty-two hundred. The house takes sixty percent off the top. Out of my eight eighty, Danny takes another twenty percent and, no, he\u2019s a bouncer, not a pimp, and I\u2019ve never done that before last night. And, no, I don\u2019t expect you to believe me. Then there\u2019s costumes, hair, waxing, make up . . . \u201d She leaned back, draped both arms along the back of the bench. \u201cYou tell me. Would fucking a complete stranger for three hours be worth five hundred dollars?\u201d\n Her mouth stretched in a hard smile but her eyes glistened. She put one ankle up on the other knee.\n \u201cDoes your ankle still hurt?\u201d It just popped out.\n Cookie turned away, blinked a couple of times. Cody found herself kneeling before the bench.\n \u201cCookie? Cookie, don\u2019t cry.\u201d\n \u201cSusana,\u201d she said, still turned away.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cSusana. It\u2019s my real name. Susana Herrera.\u201d She turned to Cody, and her face was fierce. \u201cI am Susana Herrera. I\u2019m a dancer, I\u2019m not a whore, and I want to know what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d\n \u201cWhat I\u2019ve . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cI dance. I tease, I hint. It makes you feel good, you give me money, which makes me feel good. Sometimes I give a lapdance, but always by the rules: hands on the armrest, clothes on, a little bump and grind, because I need the extra tips. I dance, you pay. It\u2019s my job. But this, this isn\u2019t a job! I don\u2019t know what it is. It\u2019s crazy. I let you\u2014\u201d Her cheeks darkened. \u201cAnd I would do it again, for no money. For nothing. It\u2019s crazy. I feel . . . It\u2019s like . . . I don\u2019t even know how to say it! I want to talk to you, listen to you talk about your business. I want to see your house. I didn\u2019t sleep last night. I thought about you: your smile, your hands, how strong it made me feel to give you pleasure, how warm I felt when you wrapped your arms around me. And I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n \u201cMe too,\u201d Cody said, and she was, very, because she was beginning to get an idea what was wrong with them and it felt like a very bad joke.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid.\u201d Susana folded her arms, turned her face again.\n \u201cI am. Cook\u2014 Susana, do you suppose . . . Shit. I feel ridiculous even saying this. Look at me. Please. Thank you. Do you suppose this is what l\u2014\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t say it. She didn\u2019t believe it.\n After a very long pause, Susana said, \u201cDancers don\u2019t fall in love with the marks.\u201d\n That cut. \u201cMarks don\u2019t fall in love with whores.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not a\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNeither am I.\u201d\n They stared at each other. Cody\u2019s phone rang. She thumbed it off without looking. \u201cMy full name is Candice Marcinko. I have to fly back to San Francisco this afternoon but I could come back to Atlanta at the end of the week. We could, you know, talk, go to the movies, walk in the park.\u201d Jesus, had she left any stereotype unturned? She tried again. \u201cI want to meet your, your cat.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have a cat.\u201d\n \u201cOr your dog,\u201d she said. Stop babbling. But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cI want to learn how long you\u2019ve lived in Atlanta and what kind of food you like and whether you think the Braves will win tonight and how you feel when you sleep in my arms.\u201d She felt like an idiot.\n Susana looked at her for a while, then picked up the box at her side. \u201cDo you like Krispy Kreme?\u201d\n When Cody turned her phone on again at the airport, there was a message from Richard: Call me, it\u2019s important. But she had to run for her plane.\n In the air she leaned her head against the window and listened to the drone of the engines.\n Susana, sitting on the bench while the sun went down, thinking, Love, love is for rich people.\n A cream labrador runs by, head turned to watch its owner, running alongside. Its tongue lolls, happy and pink. Dogs love. Dogs are owned.\n She tears the last three doughnuts to pieces and throws them to the ducks.\n On Thursday, Vince and the executive team toasted her with champagne. She took the opportunity to ask for Friday and two days next week off. Vince couldn\u2019t say no without looking chintzy, so he told her VPs didn\u2019t have to ask permission.\n VP. She grinned hard and for a minute she felt almost normal. VP. Top dog.\n Friday morning she had just got out of the shower when the doorbell rang. She was so surprised she barely remembered to pull on a robe before she opened the door.\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s a sight for sore eyes.\u201d\n \u201cRichard!\u201d\n \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate the gesture but could you please tighten that belt, at least until we\u2019ve had coffee? Here you go, quad grande, two percent.\u201d\n She went to get dressed. When she emerged, drying her hair with a towel, he was sitting comfortably on the couch, ankle crossed at the knee, just like Susana in the park.\n \u201cI envy you that dyke rub-and-go convenience.\u201d\n She draped the towel round her neck, sat, and sipped the latte. \u201cTo paraphrase you, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t appreciate the coffee, but . . . why the fuck are you here?\u201d\n He put his phone on the table next to her latte. \u201cRemember this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s your phone?\u201d\n He took a thumbdrive from his laptop case and gave it, then her, a significant look.\n \u201cRichard, I\u2019ve had a real weird few days and I\u2019m on a plane in four hours. Maybe.\u201d Maybe she was crazy, maybe she should cancel . . . \u201cAnyhow, could you please just get to the point?\u201d\n \u201cDrink your coffee. You\u2019re going to need it. And tell me what happened on Tuesday night.\u201d He held up his hand. \u201cJust tell me. Because my guess is you had a hell of a night with a lovely young thing called Cookie.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t say anything for a long, long time. \u201cSusana,\u201d she said finally.\n \u201cAh. You got that far? Susana Herrera, aged twenty-four\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTwenty-six.\u201d\n \u201cTwenty-four. Trust me. Mother Antonia Herrera, father unknown. Dunwoody community college, degree in business administration\u2014oh, the look on your face\u2014and one previous arrest for possession of a controlled substance. Healthy as an ox. Not currently taking any medication except contraceptive pills.\u201d\n \u201cThe pill?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n \u201cNothing. Go on.\u201d\n \u201cNo known allergies to pharmaceuticals, though a surprising tolerance to certain compounds, for example sodium thiopental and terpazine hydrochloride.\u201d\n Cody seized on something that made sense. \u201cWait. I know that drug. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n \u201cRU486 for the mind. That\u2019s the one.\u201d\n \u201cOh, Jesus, Richard, you didn\u2019t give her that! You didn\u2019t make her forget what happened!\u201d\n \u201cNot what happened Tuesday.\u201d\n Cody, confused, said nothing.\n He plugged the thumbdrive into his laptop and turned the screen so she could see the sound file icons. \u201cIt will all make sense when you\u2019ve listened to these.\u201d\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t have time. I have a plane\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll want to cancel that, if it\u2019s to Atlanta. Just listen. Then I\u2019ll answer questions.\u201d\n He tapped play.\n \u201c . . . ever happens, I promise no one will ever hear what goes on this tape except you.\u201d\n \u201cCue ominous music.\u201d\n She jumped at the sound of her own voice. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShh.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014more an, um, an ethics thing.\u201d\n \u201cJesus, Richard. You\u2019re such a drama queen.\u201d Pause. Clink.\n \u201cI\u2019ve done my research, too. Like you, I\u2019m pretty sure what will happen after you\u2019ve made your presentations to Boone.\u201d\n \u201cThe Golden Key.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014but what I need to know from you is whether or not you can authorize out-of-pocket expenses in the high five figures to win this contract.\u201d\n He touched pause. \u201cRing any bells?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d Cody\u2019s esophagus had clamped shut. She could hardly swallow her own spit, never mind the latte. But the cardboard was warm and smooth in her hand, comforting, and behind Richard her fish swam serenely back and forth.\n \u201cTerpazine is a good drug. We managed to calculate your dosage beautifully. Susana\u2019s was a bit more of a challenge. Incredible metabolism.\u201d\n \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t give her\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNot in the last couple of weeks. But you\u2019ve had it six times, and she seven. Now keep listening.\u201d\n Six times?\n \u201c\u2014the exploration of memory and its retrieval. So exciting. A perfect dovetail with the work I\u2019ve been doing on how people form attachments. It\u2019s all about familiarity. You let someone in deep enough, or enough times, then your brain actually rewires to recognize that person as friend, or family.\u201d\n Pause.\n \u201cThere are ways to make it easier for someone to let you in.\u201d\n Clink of bottle on glass.\n \u201cI\u2019ve told you about those studies that show it\u2019s as simple as having Person A anticipate Person B\u2019s needs and fulfill them.\u201d\n \u201cSo don\u2019t tell me again.\u201d\n She sounded so sure of herself, bored even. A woman who had never thought to use the world love.\n \u201c\u2014jumpstart the familiarization process. For example, person A works in a bookshop and is lonely, and when she\u2019s lonely chocolate makes her feel better. And one day person B arrives mid-afternoon with some chocolate, says Hey, you look sorta miserable, when I\u2019m miserable chocolate makes me feel better, would you like one? and A eats a chocolate and thinks, Wow, this B person is very thoughtful and empathic and must be just like me, and therefore gets slotted immediately into the almost-friend category. It\u2019s easy to set something like that up. You just have to know enough about person A.\u201d\n Know enough.\n Cody pushed the laptop from her. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d\n \u201cNo?\u201d\n Cody didn\u2019t say anything.\n \u201cYou sat in that Seattle bar, and you listened, and then you signed a temporary waiver.\u201d He placed a piece of paper on the table by her hand. It was her signature at the bottom\u2014a little sloppy, but hers. \u201cThen you took some terpazine and forgot all about it.\u201d\n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t forget something like this.\u201d\n He held up his hand. Reached with his other and nudged the sound file slider to the right.\n \u201cTake the pill.\u201d\n \u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Pause. Tinkle of ice cubes. \u201cJesus. That tastes vile.\u201d\n \u201cNext time we\u2019ll put it in a capsule. Just be grateful it\u2019s not the vasopressin. It would make you gag. I speak from experience.\u201d\n He tapped the file to silence. \u201cIt really does. Anyhow, a week after Seattle I came here and you signed a more robust set of papers.\u201d He handed her a thick, bound document. \u201cBelieve me, they\u2019re bombproof.\u201d\n \u201cWait.\u201d She dropped the document on her lap without looking. \u201cYou came here? To my apartment?\u201d\n \u201cI did. I played the recording you\u2019ve just heard, showed you the initial waiver. Gave you that.\u201d He nodded at her lap. \u201cYou signed. I gave you the sodium thiopental, we had our first session. You took another terpazine.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cIt happened.\u201d He tapped the paper in her lap. \u201cThere\u2019s a signed waiver for every session.\u201d\n \u201cHow many did you say?\u201d\n \u201cSix. Four here, twice in North Carolina.\u201d\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t remember!\u201d\n The fish in her tank swam back and forth, back and forth. She closed her eyes. Opened them. The fish were still there. Richard was still there. She could still remember the weight of Susana\u2019s breasts in her hands.\n \u201cYou\u2019d better listen to the rest. And read everything over.\u201d\n He tapped play.\n \u201cOkay. Think about what it would be like if you knew enough about someone and then you met: you\u2019d know things about her and she\u2019d know things about you, but all you\u2019d know is that you recognize and trust this person and you feel connected. Now imagine what might happen if you add sex to the equation.\u201d\n \u201cGood sex, I hope.\u201d\n \u201cThe best. There are hundreds of studies that show how powerful sex bonding can be, especially for women. If a woman has an orgasm in the presence of another person, her hormonal output for the next few days is sensitized to her lover: every time they walk in the room, her system floods with chemical messengers like oxytocin saying Friend! Friend! This is even with people you know, consciously, aren\u2019t good for you. You put that together with someone compatible, who fits\u2014whether they really fit or just seem to fit\u2014and it\u2019s a chemical bond with the potential to be human superglue. That\u2019s what love is: a bond that\u2019s renewed every few days until the brain is utterly rewired. So I wanted to know what would happen if you put together two sexually compatible people who magically knew exactly\u2014exactly!\u2014what the other wanted in bed but had no memory of how they\u2019d acquired that knowledge . . . \u201d\n It took Cody a moment to pause the sound. \u201cLove,\u201d she said. \u201cLove? What the fuck have you done to me?\u201d\n \u201cYou did it to yourself. Keep listening.\n And she did. After she had listened for an hour, she accepted the sheaf of transcripts Richard handed her from his case.\n She looked at the clock.\n \u201cStill thinking about that plane?\u201d\n Cody didn\u2019t know what she was thinking.\n \u201cIs it refundable?\u201d he said. \u201cThe flight?\u201d\n Cody nodded.\n \u201cGive me the ticket. I\u2019ll cancel for you. You can always rebook for tomorrow. But you need to read.\u201d\n She watched, paralyzed, as Richard picked up the phone and dialed. He turned to her while he was on hold, mouthed Read, and turned away again.\n So she began to read, only vaguely aware of Richard arguing his way up the airline hierarchy.\n After the first hundred pages of Subject C and Subject S, he brought her fresh coffee. She paused at one section, appalled.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe I told you that.\u201d\n He peered over her shoulder. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a juicy one. Stop blushing. I\u2019ve heard it all before. Several times now. Sodium thiopental will make you say anything. Besides, you don\u2019t remember telling me, so why bother being embarrassed?\u201d\n She watched her fish. It didn\u2019t matter. Didn\u2019t matter. She picked up the paper again and plowed on. May as well get it over with.\n Somewhere around page three hundred, he went into the kitchen to make lunch. She didn\u2019t remember eating it, but when she set aside the final page at seven o\u2019clock that evening, she saw that the plate by her elbow was empty, and heard the end of Richard\u2019s order to the Chinese takeout place on the corner. It was clearly something he\u2019d done before. From her phone, in her apartment. And she didn\u2019t remember.\n She wished there was a way to feed him terpazine so he would forget all those things she\u2019d never said to another soul before.\n She tried to organize her thoughts.\n He had asked for her permission to use her in an experiment. It would mean she would feel comfortable at the club in Atlanta, that she might even have a good couple of hours, and it would further his work while being paid for to some extent by her expense account. He had traveled to the Golden Key and picked Susana as the most likely dancer to fit her fantasies\u2014and he knew a little about her preferences from that stupid, stupid night in Dallas\u2014and made the same pitch to her. Only Susana got paid.\n Twice, Cody thought. I paid her too.\n And so Richard had flown to Cody\u2019s apartment in San Francisco and given her sodium thiopental, and she had talked a bluestreak about her sexual fantasies, every nuance and variation and degree of pleasure. In North Carolina, she had talked about her fantasies again, even more explicitly, encouraged to imagine in great detail, pretend it was happening, while they had her hooked up to a functional MRI and other machines.\n Richard put down the phone. \u201cFood in thirty minutes.\u201d\n Cody forced herself to stay focused, to think past her embarrassment. \u201cWhat were the fMRIs for, the fMRIs, blood-gas sensors, and\u2014\u201d she glanced at the paper, \u201c\u2014TMS during the, the fantasy interludes?\u201d\n \u201cWe built a kind of mind and hormone map of how you\u2019d feel if someone was actually doing those things to you. A sort of super-empathy direction finder. And one from Susana, of course. We played your words to each other, along with transcranial magnetic stimulation to encourage brain plasticity\u2014the rewiring.\u201d\n \u201cAnd,\u201d she hunted through the pages for the section labeled Theoretical Underpinnings. \u201cYou gave me, us, oxytocin?\u201d\n \u201cNo. We wanted to separate out the variables. You supplied the oxytocin on your own, later.\u201d He beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful part. It was all your own doing. Your hopes, your hormones, your needs. Yours. We made a couple of suggestions to each of you that you might not have come up with on your own: that expensive watch and the loose clothes, Cookie\u2019s hat and spurs. But the rest was just you and Cookie, I mean Susana. But you two were primed for each other, so if that wasn\u2019t the best sex of your life, I\u2019ll eat this table.\u201d He rapped the table top in satisfaction.\n All her own doing.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t publish,\u201d she said.\n \u201cNot this, no.\u201d He picked up one of the fMRIs and admired it. \u201cIt\u2019s enough for now to know that it works.\u201d\n She waited for anger to well up but nothing happened. \u201cIs this real?\u201d\n \u201cThe project? Quite real.\u201d\n Project. She watched him gather all the documents, tap them into a neat pile.\n \u201cNot the project,\u201d she said. \u201cNot the TMS, the fMRIs, the terpazine. This.\u201d She tapped her chest. \u201cIs it real?\u201d\n He tilted his head. \u201cIs love real? A lot of people seem to think so. But if you mean, is that what you\u2019re feeling, the answer is, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think a scan could give you that answer. But it could tell us if you\u2019ve changed: your data have been remarkably clear. Not like Cookie\u2019s. Susana\u2019s.\u201d He held the fMRI image up again, admired it some more, then put it back in the pile.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cThe data. Yours were perfectly consistent. Hers were . . . erratic.\u201d\n \u201cErratic.\u201d Her mind seemed to be working in another dimension. It took an age for the thought to form. \u201cLike lying?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s lied about a lot of things.\u201d\n \u201cBut she could have been lying to me? About how she feels?\u201d\n He shrugged. \u201cHow can we ever know?\u201d\n She stared at him.\u201cThe literature,\u201d she said, trying to force her slippery brain to remember what she\u2019d just read. \u201cIts says love\u2019s a feedback loop, right?\u201d\n \u201cIn terms of individual brain plasticity, yes.\u201d\n \u201cSo it\u2019s mutual. I can\u2019t love someone if she doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d If it was love.\n He gave her a look she couldn\u2019t interpret. \u201cThe data don\u2019t support interdependence.\u201d He paused, said more gently, \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Pity, she realized. He pities me. She felt the first flex and coil of something so far down she couldn\u2019t identify it. \u201cWhat have you done to me? What else have you done to me?\u201d\n \u201cTo you? For you.\u201d\n \u201cYou made me feel something for a woman who fucked for money. Who had her mind fucked for money.\u201d\n \u201cSo did you, if you think about. Just at one remove.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cSo, what, you did it for science?\u201d\n Cody changed direction. \u201cDoes Susana know?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m flying to Atlanta tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cDo you have her sound files with you?\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d\n \u201cLet me hear them.\u201d\n \u201cThat would be unethical.\u201d\n Unethical. \u201cI think you might be a monster,\u201d she said, but without heat.\n \u201cI have a strange way of showing it, then, wouldn\u2019t you say? For the price of a few embarrassing experimental sessions you won\u2019t ever remember, I won you a contract, a girlfriend and a night on the town.\u201d\n She stared at him. \u201cYou expect me to be grateful . . . \u201d\n \u201cWell, look at this place. Look at it. Bare walls. Fish, for god\u2019s sake.\u201d\n \u201cGet out.\u201d\n \u201cOh, come on\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOut.\u201d\n \u201cBy tomorrow it will all fall into perspective.\u201d\n \u201cI swear to god, if you don\u2019t leave now I\u2019ll break your face.\u201d She sounded so weirdly calm. Was this shock, or was it just how people in love, or whatever, behaved? She had no idea. \u201cAnd you can put those papers down. They\u2019re mine, my private thoughts. Leave them right there on the table. The thumbdrive, too.\u201d\n He pulled the drive, laid it on the papers, stowed his laptop and stood. She held the door open for him.\n He was halfway through the door when she said, \u201cRichard. You can\u2019t tell Susana like this.\u201d\n \u201cNo?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s too much of a shock.\u201d\n \u201cYou seem to be coping admirably.\u201d\n \u201cAt least I already knew you. Or thought I did. You\u2019ll be a complete stranger to her. You can\u2019t. You just can\u2019t. It\u2019s . . . inhumane. And she\u2019s so young.\u201d\n \u201cYoung? Don\u2019t make me laugh. She makes you look like an infant.\u201d He walked away.\n Cookie danced. She didn\u2019t want to think about the phone call. Didn\u2019t want to think about any of it. Creep.\n But there was the money.\n The lights were hot, but the air conditioning cold. Her skin pebbled.\n \u201cYo, darlin\u2019, let\u2019s you and me go to the back room,\u201d the suit with the moustache and bad tie said. He was drunk. She knew the type. He\u2019d slip his hands from the chair, try cop a feel, get pissed off when she called in Danny, refuse to pay.\n \u201cWell, now,\u201d she said, in her special honey voice. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019ve got the green,\u201d and pushed her breasts together invitingly. He flicked a bill across her breasts. \u201cA five won\u2019t buy you much, baby.\u201d\n \u201cFive\u2019ll buy you, babydoll,\u201d he said, hamming for his table buddies. One of them giggled. Ugly sound in a man, Cookie thought. \u201cFive\u2019ll buy you five times!\u201d\n \u201cAnd how long did it take you to come up with that, honey?\u201d\n \u201cThe fuck?\u201d He looked confused.\n \u201cI said, your brain must be smaller than your dick which I\u2019d guess is even smaller than your wallet, only I doubt that\u2019s possible,\u201d and she plucked the bill from his fingers, snapped it under her G-string and walked away.\n In the dressing room she looked at herself in the mirror. Twenty-four was too old for this. Definitely. She had no idea what time it was.\n She stuck her head out of the door. \u201cDanny!\u201d\n \u201cYes, doll.\u201d\n \u201cTime is it?\u201d She\u2019d have to get herself a watch someday. A nice expensive watch.\n \u201cTen after,\u201d Danny said.\n \u201cAfter what?\u201d\n \u201cTen.\u201d\n Three hours earlier on the West Coast. She stacked her night\u2019s take, counted it, thought for a minute, peeled off two hundred in fives and ones. She stuck her head out of the door again. \u201cDanny!\u201d\n \u201cHere, doll.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m gone.\u201d\n \u201cYou sick?\u201d He ambled up the corridor, stood breathing heavily by the door.\n \u201cSick of this.\u201d\n \u201cMister Pergoletti says\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou tell Pergoletti to stick it. I\u2019m gone. Seriously.\u201d She handed him the wad of bills. \u201cYou take care of these girls, now. And have a good life.\u201d\n \u201cGot something else lined up?\u201d\n \u201cGuess we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n There was one bottle of beer in Cody\u2019s fridge. She opened it, poured it carefully into a glass, stared at the beige foam. A glass: she never drank beer from a glass. She poured it down the sink. She had no idea what was real anymore but she was pretty sure alcohol would only make things worse.\n She made green tea instead and settled down in the window seat. The sun hung low over the bay. What did Susana see from her apartment? Was her ankle better? Contraceptive pills, Jesus. And, oh, the smell of her skin.\n She was losing her mind.\n She didn\u2019t know who she hated more: Richard for making the proposal, or herself for accepting it. Or Susana. Susana had done it for money.\n Or maybe . . . But what about those contraceptive pills?\n And what if Susana did feel . . . whatever it was? Did that make it real? It was all an experiment, all engineered. Fake.\n But it didn\u2019t feel fake. She wanted to cradle Susana, kiss her ankle better, protect her from the world. The Richards of the world.\n She picked up the phone, remembered for the tenth time she had neither address nor phone number. She called information, who told her there was no listing under Susana Herrera in the Atlanta Metro area. She found herself unsurprised.\n She got the number for the Golden Key instead.\n A man called Pergoletti answered. \u201cCookie? She\u2019s gone. They always go.\u201d The music thumped. Cody\u2019s insides vibrated in sympathy, remembering.\n \u201c\u2014don\u2019t have a number. Hey, you interested in a job?\u201d\n Cody put the phone down carefully. Sipped her tea. Picked up the phone again, and called Richard.\n It was open mic night at Coffee to the People. Richard was in the back room on a sofa, as far from the music as possible. Two cups on the table. One still full.\n \u201cYou knew I\u2019d call.\u201d\n \u201cI did.\u201d\n \u201cDid you program that, too?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t program anything. I primed you\u2014and only about the sex.\u201d He patted the sofa. \u201cSit down before you fall down.\u201d\n She sat. Blinked. \u201cGive me her phone number.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t. She gave me a fake. I called her at the club, but she hung up on me.\u201d He seemed put out.\n \u201cWhat does she know?\u201d\n \u201cI talked fast. I don\u2019t know how much she heard. But I told her she wouldn\u2019t get the rest of the money until we\u2019d done follow up.\u201d\n The singer in the other room sang of love and broken hearts. It was terrible, but it made Cody want to cry anyway.\n \u201cHow long does it last?\u201d\n \u201cLove? I don\u2019t know. I avoid it where possible.\u201d\n \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d\n Richard lifted his laptop bag. \u201cI planned for this eventuality.\u201d He took out a small white cardboard box. He opened it, shook something onto his hand. A gray plastic inhaler.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cA vasopressin analogue, formulated to block oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens. That is, the antidote.\u201d\n They both looked at it.\n \u201cIt works in voles,\u201d he said. \u201cFemale voles.\u201d\n Voles. \u201cYou said it tasted bad.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve used it. Just in case. I prefer my sex without complications. And I\u2019ve had a lot of sex and never once fallen in love.\u201d He arched his eyebrows. \u201cSo, hey, it must work.\u201d\n The elephant whistle hypothesis. Hey, Bob, what\u2019s that whistle? Well, Fred, it keeps elephants away. Don\u2019t be an asshole, Bob, there aren\u2019t any elephants around here. Well, Fred, that\u2019s because of my whistle.\n \u201cCody.\u201d He did his best to look sincere. \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry. I never thought it would work. Not like this. But I do think the antidote might work.\u201d His face went back to normal. He hefted the inhaler. \u201cThough before I give it to you, I have a favor to ask.\u201d\n She stared at him. \u201cOn what planet do I owe you anything?\u201d\n \u201cFor science, then. A follow up scan, and then another after you take the antidote.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t take it. Give me the info you have. Give me the number.\u201d\n \u201cLove is a form of insanity, you know.\u201d\n \u201cThe number.\u201d\n In the other room, the bad singing went on and on.\n \u201cOh, all right. For old time\u2019s sake.\u201d He extracted a folder from his bag, and a piece of paper from the folder. He slid it across the table towards her, put the inhaler on top of it.\n She nudged the inhaler aside, picked up the paper. Hand written. Susana\u2019s writing.\n \u201cLove\u2019s just biochemical craziness,\u201d he said, \u201cdesigned to make us take a leap in the dark, to trust complete strangers. It\u2019s not rational.\u201d\n Cody said nothing.\n \u201cShe screwed us.\u201d\n \u201cShe screwed you,\u201d Cody said. \u201cMaybe she fell in love with me.\u201d But she took the inhaler.\n Cody sat in the window seat with the phone and the form Susana had filled in. Every now and again she punched in a different combination of the numbers Susana had written and got the Cannot be completed as dialed voice. Every now and again she touched the form with the tip of her middle finger; she could feel the indentation made by Susana\u2019s strong strokes. Strong strokes, strong hands, strong mouth.\n She didn\u2019t think about the gray inhaler in its white box, which she had put in the fridge\u2014to stay viable a long time, just in case.\n After a while she stopped dialing and simply waited.\n When her phone lit up at 11:46 she knew who it was\u2014even before she saw the 404 area code on the screen.\n \u201cDo you feel it?\u201d Susana said.\n \u201cYes,\u201d and Cody did. Whatever it was, wherever it came from, it was there, as indelible as ink. She wanted to say, I don\u2019t know if this is real, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good. She wanted to ask, Had you ever had sex with anyone for money before me? and Does it matter? She wanted to know, Have you ever loved anyone before? and, How can you know?\n She wanted to say, Will it hurt?\n Walking through the crowds at the airport, Cody searched for the familiar face, felt her heart thump every time she thought she saw her. Panic, or love? She didn\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t know anything except that her throat ached.\n Someone jostled her with his bag, and when she looked up, there was the back of that head, that smooth brown hair, so familiar, after just one night, and all her blood vessels seemed to expand at once, every cell leap forward.\n She didn\u2019t move. This was it, the last moment. This was where she could just let the crowd carry her past, carry her away, out into the night. Walk away. Go home. Use the inhaler in the fridge.\n That was the sensible thing. But the Cody who had hung from the ninth story balcony, the Cody who had risked the Atlanta contract without a second thought, that Cody thought, fuck it, and stepped forward.\n You couldn\u2019t know.

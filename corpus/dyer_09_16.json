Before cancer took her.\nWho believed in fomoiri in 2042? At the time, I bit my tongue and charitably assumed it was her oblique warning about violent partners and the end of days. When fuel ran out, everyone who didn\u2019t raise their own food relocated inside ration delivery zones. She moved in with me, bringing as many of the half mirrors as she could fit in a wagon hitched to the back of her pushbike.\nMe old Mam, cycling sixty kilometers from Cahersiveen. Happy days.\nShe did always go on about the better halves of human nature, about seeing the good in things. Since Da was a useless tool, I\u2019d tell her that when I looked in the half mirrors I could only see the half of me that came from her.\nMam\u2019s half mirrors match what\u2019s technically only half a house. Since she died, a young single mother got allocated the upstairs. That interloper\u2019s two children thump around like live basketballs and she hogs the washing line down the side, but I\u2019ve got a sunroom at the back with the windows all smashed where I hang my laundry to dry.\nIn a corner of that wrecked sunroom are three heavy, soil-filled pots with dead trees. Sad stick skeletons with the morning sun on them. I should be tossing them, but I can\u2019t, any more than I can toss the half mirrors.\nMam dug up three hazel saplings and brought them inside when the next-door house collapsed on our garden. She loved those little trees, just like she loved the oak woodland by Lough Leane. I can\u2019t even keep a plant alive. Lucky I never became a parent.\nAnd now I\u2019ve mooned about, gazing guiltily at them, for so long that I\u2019m late for the lock-in. Can\u2019t even be on time to save our besieged final scrap of wild.\nHaven\u2019t even called the hospital to let them know I won\u2019t be at work today.\nSliding in my socks across the solid oak floorboards\u2014they\u2019re the only indestructible part of the whole shitty, falling-down house\u2014I dump my tea dregs in the kitchen sink. It\u2019s not backed up because of the mouse in the dried-up u-bend addicted to tea leaves.\nThe plumbing doesn\u2019t work.\nIt hasn\u2019t worked for fifty years, which is how I got the house so cheap. Which is fine, since these days the village tap water\u2019s poison. It\u2019s as deadly as all those lush meadows and sweeping fields that kill stone dead any escaped stock that graze on them.\nBottled gallons come as part of the weekly ration.\nMam used to do a dowsing course for tourists back in Cahersiveen. When she came here, she promised she\u2019d find me my own source of spring water. Carrying her daft twig through the house, she\u2019d stopped in the middle of the sunroom and said it was under the boards.\nI told her I wasn\u2019t pulling up the boards. They\u2019re the only indestructible part of the whole shitty, falling-down house.\nWhen I pick up the phone, it doesn\u2019t work any better than the taps do.\nWhich is new.\nBut it was only a matter of time. We live in a shitty, falling-down world.\nThe lock-in is exactly what it sounds like.\nA gaggle of fools, me included, crowd the grass outside the towering gates, dodging Clydesdale manure piles and patting one another on the back for putting the woodland ahead of our own hungry families.\nExcept I\u2019ve got no family left. It\u2019s not that much of a battle for me, so.\nWe\u2019re going to lock ourselves onto the gates of the walled-in woodland. There, the lakeside forest, still emerald green, hides ruined abbeys and harp-haunted hill forts.\nThe ancient wall was renovated in the thirties. Four meters of gray-painted concrete is supposed to keep looters out of the castles and weeds and feral cats out of the woods.\nEver since the big enviro-disaster, though, there\u2019s been something spooky about the wall. On the outside, like all the local houses and farms, the soil tests toxic.\nNot inside the wall, strangely enough. No poison seeping up through the roots of those gnarly old oaks. Nobody knows why.\nNobody cares why. They want to open up the gates to let the sheep and cattle in to graze.\nToday!\nBut not today. Today we\u2019ve got enough warm bodies to make a human barricade.\nI wonder how we\u2019re going to organize tomorrow, without phones, but then there\u2019s no time for wondering because we milling protesters must speedily handcuff ourselves to one another. In fact, since I\u2019m late, I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t patrol cars here already.\nBut the phones aren\u2019t working. I guess the farmers can\u2019t call the Garda\u00ed.\nEveryone\u2019s brought their own bangin, blacksmith-made manacles.\n\u201cFaster!\u201d the organizer bellows. \u201cNext!\u201d\nI\u2019m next.\nAnd that\u2019s when I see I\u2019m supposed to be locked onto one of the aos s\u00ed. He\u2019s sitting cross-legged on the ground, being careful not to lean back against the iron of the gate.\nHow ninety-nine aos s\u00ed got stuck on this side of Lough Leane.\n- This is the story they used to be telling the tourists: Every seven years, on May 1st, the famous warrior chieftain O\u2019Donoghue M\u00f3r rises from the lake near Ross castle. The fairy host from the land of youth floats over the waters of Lough Leane in the wake of his hovering white horse.\n- Catching a glimpse of him is pure good luck.\n- Nobody actually catches any glimpses of him.\n- Rephrase: Nobody, in those early-millennium days of miniature cameras everywhere, managed to film him.\n- Then one morning, the sun came up on ninety-nine ethereally beautiful eternal-youths and one pissed-off warrior ghost. Teenagers had their drones out there in a heartbeat to confirm what the shocked groundskeepers reported to Radio Kerry.\n- Later, scientists surmised all the drilling and hydraulic fracturing for gas and shale oil caused a miniature earthquake sometime between dusk and dawn. Half the lake water drained away into underground parts unknown. Phenols contaminated the other half.\nFracking fluid poisoned the groundwater, too. There were dead fish. Trees losing their leaves mid-summer. A rain of death.\nA magic door closed and locked, perhaps in self-defense, from the other side.\n- The ghost of O\u2019Donoghue M\u00f3r swore to find a lake still pure enough to reopen the portal between worlds. He set off alone.\n- He hasn\u2019t returned. That was ten years ago.\nThe aos s\u00ed looks the way they all look, the ones that come from royalty.\nSomething like Orlando Bloom, circa two thousand, in a long blond wig made from Russian ladies\u2019 hair. But pecs, by God! This one\u2019s got magnificent pecs making the buttons of his silk shirt pop.\nAnd I remember the last thing I saw on the free web before it stopped working. That serial killer, Cian, and how he looked at his trial. Much the same as this. Much the same as an ageless aos s\u00ed supremacist still looks after nine years in maximum security, I\u2019d be guessing.\nI stared at the accused in that witness box. I knew he was pure evil. But society had trained me to find him beautiful, and beautiful he was, feck it all to hell. The words of the human reporter washed over me without leaving any impression. I stared at the flawless face of that ruthless cunt, trying to imagine the screams. The blood. The bodies of Cian\u2019s victims on that inter-island ferry where he\u2019d cut them down with keen-edged, aos s\u00ed-forged silver before sinking the ship with a thousand corpses on board.\nI couldn\u2019t find him ugly.\nNo matter how I tried.\nI think that moment was the moment. It was the first time I turned on myself. I always liked who I was, before then. That moment was when the self-hating started.\nAt the woodland gate, nobody offers to sit down next to the aos s\u00ed. Nobody rushes forward to take my place. Nobody trusts the fancy titanium handcuffs he\u2019s brought because he can\u2019t be abiding the touch of iron.\nOf course he cares about the oak woodland. Of course he wants to do something, the same as the villagers do.\nI just wish he\u2019d do it somewhere else. When I look at him, I see Cian. Worse, I remember the repulsive inner me that wanted to fuck Cian, even knowing what he\u2019d done.\nI plonk myself on the pavement, shoulder to shoulder with the aos s\u00ed protester, and thrust my hand through the cuff without a word.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he says as he locks my wrist tight to his. I ignore him. A gray-haired granny in a flannelette shirt sits on my other side.\n\u201cHow\u2019s she cutting?\u201d I ask her casually, offering my other wrist.\n\u201cStraight down the middle like a razor blade,\u201d is granny\u2019s gruff reply as she snaps herself onto me.\n\u201cI\u2019m Miach,\u201d the aos s\u00ed tells me, trying again.\n\u201cG\u2019luck, so,\u201d I say, giving him my best stop-talking-to-me glare. His eyes are the color of green glass held up to the sun; green like the woodland in spring; green like the new leaves on Mam\u2019s hazel trees that I didn\u2019t water til it was too late.\nThen it dawns on me that this aos s\u00ed isn\u2019t one of the stranded ninety-nine. Mam and I looked closely at all those faces on the news, trying to see if any of them was the fomoiri she met at the pub. None of them were.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting on my foot,\u201d he says, at the same time as I say,\n\u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d\n\u201cMiach,\u201d he replies patiently.\nI move my arse off his ankle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not one of the ninety-nine.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I came through the door long before they did. My father kept trying to kill me, you see.\u201d\nFlashback of Da\u2019s fist raised in anger.\n\u201cWhich door did you come through?\u201d I wonder aloud. \u201cThe lake? The same as O\u2019Donoghue?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Miach gives a subtle shrug. \u201cCenturies ago, I was brought out of a stone well in a hazel thicket. Its waters were even purer than the waters of the lake. Since coming back here a few days ago, I haven\u2019t been able to find it. It must be covered in iron. Somewhere under the village.\u201d\nJaysus.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be helping the ninety-nine find their way back home,\u201d he carries on, unperturbed, \u201cbut today the woodland seemed more important.\u201d\nThe woodland isn\u2019t important. I don\u2019t give one single flying feck for the woodland. I\u2019m here because Mam would have been here. I\u2019m just doing what she would have done.\n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be at the hospital,\u201d I say. Respect enters Miach\u2019s already rather stiff and respectful expression, so I add quickly, \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor.\u201d\n\u201cA nurse?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nI\u2019m not a nurse. Too dumb for that. Remember that nurse who killed a man by putting a decimal point in the wrong place? I clean floors. I lift heavy things.\nBefore that, I vacuumed the carpets at the fracking company offices. That was prior to the earthquake. Mam never told me straight out that I was aiding and abetting the ruination of the natural world, but I saw it in her sad eyes whenever she straightened me uniform collar.\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a nurse, yourself?\u201d I react rudely.\n\u201cA doctor,\u201d Miach says. Of course he is. \u201cAt least, I used to doctor to my people. My sister and I took after our father, a celebrated healer, but it turned out we were more gifted than he was. Out of jealousy, he cut me once with his sword, through the skin. Then twice, through the bone. Then three times, all the way through my brain.\u201d He angles his head, and doesn\u2019t need to part his long hair with his fingers for me to see the faint pink scar running up the middle of his forehead and over the crown of his head.\n\u201cJaysus,\u201d I mutter. Da might have wielded his fists but he never sliced my brain in half.\n\u201cMy sister thought I was dead that third time, for sure. She brought my body through to this world. Her tears made healing herbs grow up and over me. I had to claw my way through them when I woke. By that stage I figured I\u2019d better not go back and give my father another chance at it.\u201d\n\u201cIs your father one of the ninety-nine?\u201d I ask. \u201cIs your father Cian?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nSirens drag my attention away from Miach. The Garda\u00ed are finally here. Also arriving are the shepherds with their dogs and swarms of goats and skinny border leicesters. The sheep look like they might chew through, not just herbs and bark, but the trunks of the oaks like living chainsaws.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention how you can heal yourself,\u201d I suggest to the aos s\u00ed, \u201cor they might be sawing through your arms instead of the handcuffs.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t heal myself. Not in this world. That\u2019s why I\u2019m talking to you and not this other fellow. You\u2019re on my right side. Since my father cut my head in half, I can\u2019t hear anything with my left ear and I can\u2019t see with my left eye.\u201d\nIt takes the authorities another six or seven hours to get the equipment that they need to hand. By sunset, I need to piss badly. The old lady on my right confides that she\u2019s wearing an adult diaper. Obviously I didn\u2019t think the protest through.\nThey cut Miach out of his titanium handcuffs with a steel saw. When sparks touch the blue-veined, paper-white skin of the inside of his wrist, his whole body convulses, like they touched him with an electric cattle prod. But he don\u2019t make a sound.\nHe does piss himself.\nThen I do, too, not because I\u2019m in pain but just because it\u2019s been so long, and if anyone smells me, they\u2019ll probably think it was him. I try not to care that they\u2019re hurting him. He chose to be here, same as the rest of us.\n\u201cFeckin fairy,\u201d swears the Garda sergeant, hauling Miach to his feet. She\u2019s a head shorter than he is but solid. A mean, freckly tank. They take all two dozen of us to the station and throw us behind bars, but what for? Our punishment is that the woodland gates were thrown open. Sheep and dogs went inside the fence in an endless stream. We couldn\u2019t even keep them out for one full day. The police can\u2019t punish us.\nCan\u2019t punish me, anyway. I don\u2019t think Miach likes those metal bars very much at all. He\u2019s sweating like a priest in a playground. People sneak in to ask him if he\u2019s really Miach, the fairy magician, who can heal anything, even cancer, but he shakes in a corner, as far from the cold steel as he can manage, and doesn\u2019t answer them.\nBut I deserve to be back here again.\nEvidence I\u2019m mostly Da (my worse half):\n- On weekly ration delivery night, I steal from the single mother upstairs.\nNot from the two little shitehawks. I leave their stuff alone. Just the mother. Her English isn\u2019t great. Don\u2019t think she can read the manifest. Don\u2019t think she even knows she\u2019s supposed to get mutton and Guinness in her ration.\nProbably she\u2019s a Muslim vegetarian, anyway.\n- She\u2019s not a fecking Muslim vegetarian. I\u2019m full of shite like a Christmas turkey. The fact of the matter is, I used my severance pay-out from the fracking company to pay off my house when I should have been boycotting them like everyone else. I go to protests to stop sheep from grazing in the woodland but secretly I have a terrible meat craving. A devil\u2019s buttermilk before bed helps me forget how many toxins are probably in the meat. And how I took that tainted money, and I\u2019d be taking it again, for a roof over my head, or, more accurately, for those solid oak boards under my feet.\n- Most of the time, someone in the hospital is dying of cancer. Most of the time, there aren\u2019t enough nurses to be staying on death watch with them. A lot of the time, the dying folks don\u2019t have any family that gives a flying feck.\nSometimes, they ask me to stay with them, but I don\u2019t stay. Nobody stayed with Mam when she was dying of cancer in the hospital and I was in prison, so feck \u2019em.\n- I told everyone, including my boyfriend Raoul, that I was in prison because of the protest against overturning property rights. For throwing a bottle at Garda\u00ed and then assaulting them.\n- Actually, I was trying to impress an aos s\u00ed queen who was at the protest. The Garda\u00ed put her in the back of the van and I wanted to be near her, so I threw the bottle. That wasn\u2019t enough to get me convicted so later I literally hurled shite at them, monkey-style. Everyone knows the aos s\u00ed give off pheromones. It\u2019s not my fault I wanted to fuck her so badly. I would have cheated on Raoul, who was loyal and kind. But the aos s\u00ed queen laughed at me in ugly disgust.\nI didn\u2019t think anything could make that perfect face turn ugly. Still, it didn\u2019t stop me wanting her at that time. I have a superficiality problem. Or had. Or the world I grew up in has the problem.\n- When I let Mam\u2019s trees die, it was like I killed her extra dead. All they needed was a bit of water. I should have smashed through those floorboards to find her imaginary spring. The same way I smashed through the sunroom windows because they showed me my ugly reflection too clearly. And because I was the only one in that reflection. No Raoul, after I confessed to wanting to fuck the aos s\u00ed queen. No Mam.\nAnd then, because our protest about property rights had been a complete waste of time and energy, no different to the lock-in, the Council allocated half my house to strangers.\n- Since Raoul left, I\u2019ve felt worthless because I have no romantic partner. Which is stupid.\nWhen you feel something even though it makes no sense and is stupid, that makes you even more stupid, and you spiral down, down, down, in a never-ending loop of stupidity to where Satan\u2019s kicking back in the flooded shafts of the fracking wells, smiling, sipping phenols and biding his time.\nThey let me and the aos s\u00ed, Miach, out of the cells without charge a week later.\nIt\u2019s a shame, because the food in there is better than the ration, and there\u2019s no washing-up to be doing. Not much worse than boiling the sudsy water, saved from my personal ablutions, til I\u2019m sure all the arse- and armpit-germs have been killed, before putting the saucepans in to soak. I don\u2019t even get to toss the water out after that, no matter how many bits of potato peel or oat hulls are floating in it, because it\u2019s got to be used for flushing the toilet.\nI\u2019d have to kill someone to get put away for good, though. Unfortunately they keep Cian in the capital and he\u2019s the only one I can think of worth killing.\n\u201cCould you use a volunteer at the hospital?\u201d Miach asks mildly as we linger outside the station building, blinking in the sun. There used to be hanging baskets of flowers out the front but they\u2019ve been lowered and the sheep have cropped the leaves to dirt level.\nBefore I can answer, a haggard-looking woman comes up to him, carrying a baby on her back and hugging a toddler to her skirts.\n\u201cThey said you\u2019re that magic fairy doctor, called Miach,\u201d she calls out. Two old men with leashed dogs at the street corner lift their wagging chins with interest, and a couple of lads using a smashed shopping trolley for transport wheel it over so they can listen.\n\u201cThat is my name,\u201d Miach says, holding out his hand for her to shake, but she doesn\u2019t take it.\n\u201cYou can cure cancer. I\u2019ll take you to the hospital, so. My husband\u2019s there.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t cure him.\u201d\n\u201cHis powers don\u2019t work here,\u201d I say scornfully, wishing the growing crowd would get out of my way. I\u2019m hungry and it\u2019s a fair walk home. \u201cHe can\u2019t cure anyone. Not in this world.\u201d\n\u201cThere were herbs in the oak woodland that could have cured your husband, if he had stirred himself to defend it,\u201d Miach tells the haggard-looking woman. \u201cGoats and sheep have eaten them by now.\u201d\nStunned silence from all onlookers meets this pronouncement. I\u2019m the first to recover.\n\u201cYou could have said so, at the lock-in,\u201d I tell him, getting jostled from behind by a carpenter with hammers hanging from his belt. \u201cYou could have stopped it before it happened.\u201d\n\u201cI did say so,\u201d Miach answers calmly, giving a slight shrug of his bulky shoulders. \u201cThe organizers said all aos s\u00ed were liars and I wouldn\u2019t be believed, that I was best to sit down with the rest and keep that mythical shite to myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d demands the mean, freckly Garda sergeant from the doorway behind us. \u201cCalled a press conference, have we? Move along, all of you, and your godforsaken fairy, too.\u201d\n\u201cWhich herbs?\u201d the haggard woman asks shrilly.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have picked them anyway,\u201d Miach says. \u201cThey were rare. Protected by law. My sister planted them with her tears when she wept over my dead body.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the likes of you cry,\u201d she accuses. Both the baby on her back and the toddler at her feet begin bawling, perhaps in uncanny sympathy, perhaps from hunger.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make him cry,\u201d the carpenter suggests.\n\u201cLet\u2019s make him a dead body that stays dead,\u201d somebody else agrees.\nAnd then they\u2019ve got hold of the steel shopping trolley and knocked the aos s\u00ed down with it. They turn it over, onto him, and throw their bodies on top so that Miach makes a sizzling sound like wet batter in a grill.\nI don\u2019t want to care, I\u2019m as angry as they are, but I find myself trying to get hold of the trolley, to pull it off him.\n\u201cAre you mad?\u201d I scream. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this!\u201d I glance back towards the Garda station. \u201cThey\u2019re killing him!\u201d\nThe Garda sergeant watches, unblinking, with folded arms, as the carpenter joins in with swinging hammers. When I go to grab his arm, to stop the blow from descending, I\u2019m cracked in the head with a flying elbow for my trouble.\nWhen I wake up, the haggard woman cradles my head, resentment in her eyes. I\u2019m in the spot where I fell, in front of the station, but the crowd is gone. There\u2019s no sign of the woman\u2019s two children.\nGreenish blood dries on the pavement where Miach\u2019s body lay.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask thickly.\n\u201cIn a hospital bed beside my husband, no doubt,\u201d the haggard woman says, \u201cand that\u2019s more than he deserves. You were in the cells with him. You talked to him. Did he mention the names of those healing herbs?\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t beat it out of him, so?\u201d I laugh harshly. A migraine springs into existence like a rainbow.\nShe shakes her head.\n\u201cHe never made a sound,\u201d she says distantly. \u201cThey\u2019re not human. They don\u2019t feel pain. Not like us.\u201d\nEvidence that the aos s\u00ed feel pain:\n- Aversion. Why would Miach have scrambled away from those prison bars if they didn\u2019t cause pain? Why bring titanium handcuffs to the lock-in and take such care not to touch the gate? Why leave the land of youth for good, if not for his aversion to being chopped in half?\n- Sequence of events. First the sparks from the saw touched him. Then he pissed his pants. It wasn\u2019t dignified. It wasn\u2019t a good look, for a so-called superior immortal.\n- Physical damage. When I see him again, I see that the mob didn\u2019t stop until his back, his belly and his long limbs were burned, cracked, and bleeding green aos s\u00ed blood. Somehow, he\u2019d managed to protect his head. The hospital staff haven\u2019t the burn dressings to spare for him. His skin weeps, and sticks to the sheets, and when they turn him it tears the healing growth away.\nIt\u2019s the middle of the night.\nI\u2019m busy with the mop in Miach\u2019s ward.\nI think he\u2019s sleeping but he beckons to me from his bed.\nAt first, I think I\u2019ll pretend not to have seen him, but I find myself going to his right side, where the ear is that he can still hear with, and the eye is that he can still see with. Even weak and humiliated, he\u2019s still beautiful, I suppose; I can\u2019t see it any more. After Cian, I trained myself, through years of self-loathing self-talk, to feel nothing when I look at faces like Miach\u2019s. At bodies like his. At the female versions of bodies like his.\n\u201cWhat is it, so?\u201d I hiss.\n\u201cThe island of learning.\u201d He lifts one trembling hand to point at the wall, as if it had a window. His arm\u2019s cross-hatched by scars left behind by the shopping trolley. \u201cSheep can\u2019t get to the island in the lough. Alder against drowning, rowan against fire. Dandelion to call spirits, hawthorn to call salmon. Apple for long life, holly for luck.\u201d\nThe water level of the lake is down since the earthquake. There is no more island. There\u2019s no place the sheep can\u2019t get to. It\u2019s all connected.\nI don\u2019t know why I don\u2019t tell him.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell that woman with the sick husband about the herbs on the island? Wouldn\u2019t they have cured him?\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t believe in me, or they could not have harmed me,\u201d he says in a weak and distant whisper. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe in the woodland, or they could not have allowed it to be harmed. If you can\u2019t love a thing for its own sake, the love you profess for it in your time of need is false love. Whatever is inside the wall could not have cured him.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making any sense, Miach.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he begs. \u201cPlease find them. Fetch them for me. Killarney fern to purge the blood of iron. Kerry violet for driving out infection. Strawberry tree to sweeten dreams.\u201d\n\u201cHow can your blood have no iron?\u201d\n\u201cHave you less pity than I do? Are you less human than I am?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to help you.\u201d I lean on my mop, shaking with anger. \u201cI don\u2019t want to help you. Twice, I\u2019ve fallen under the spells of aos s\u00ed and been the worse for it. If I haven\u2019t learned by now, what use am I?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he sighs, his hand settling back against the white sheet. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped asking mortals for their names. Even if I did know them, your natures aren\u2019t in your names, and sometimes even when they seem to be, those names are lies. Where is the power that prevents the bestowing of ill-suited names? How can you function in a world where true selves are unapparent? How could you not have known Cian\u2019s nature by his black name? Any aos s\u00ed could have told you not to let him roam free.\u201d\nFae facts that I thought were probably shite but which turned out to be true:\n- They do stay young forever.\n- They can be killed by steel.\n- Their blood is green.\n- They are slaves to their names.\n- They can be weakened by professions of disbelief.\nMy shift finishes at 2AM.\nIt takes me an hour to tromp the long way through the town and down to the side of the lake. There, the footprints of my wellies in the muck look like Armstrong\u2019s on the moon. Stark where it sticks up from the shallows, lit by sleek LED arrays, is a reflective warning sign advising that levels of volatile organic compounds in Lough Leane exceed 250ppm.\nWith a little skull and crossbones underneath in case you\u2019re not really sure what that means.\nThere are no other human footprints beside mine. Ducks and dogs, it seems, have taken their chances. Swimming the lake to get to the unguarded back gate of the woodland is possibly a suicide mission, but there are too many guards and dogs near the main gate, so what choice do I have?\nI can\u2019t just be letting him die.\nI mean, I can.\nHe was after all, letting me Mam die, when he could\u2019ve come rolling in with his fancy herb lore, with her being a defender of the woodland and all.\nBut I don\u2019t want to be who I\u2019ve been, lately. I want to be the me that Mam would recognize, if her spirit was to emerge from the waters of the lake on a white horse with the fairy host flying along behind her.\nI want to be the me who picked pimply red fruit off the wild strawberry trees, and asked Mam if I could eat some, and she said their name in Latin was something like eat one, only. I tried one and I spat it out. Those Latin lads were right, after all.\nI forgot to ask Miach which part of the strawberry tree he needed when he was making his little shopping list.\nNever mind.\nThe water\u2019s cold, even with all my clothes on. Should have taken them off. They weigh me down as I start to swim.\nIt\u2019s summer, so the cold isn\u2019t a killing cold, but the tingle in my fingertips and toes that turns to numbness might be the sign of another kind of killing. There\u2019s a wooden paling fence keeping the sheep well back from the lake and I wake the clustered, woolly shapes when I climb it, shivering in my wet things.\nI left my wellies standing by themselves on the opposite side of the water, next to the sign. When I look back and see them, I stifle a giggle; it looks like my body\u2019s dematerialized just by looking at the lake.\nThen I\u2019m squelching in soggy socks along sheep trails, into the woods. Into the tangled embrace of oak and yew. Up hills and down gullies to places where fern-lined waterfalls no longer fall. Moonlight shows the bare, dry rocks.\nI put some dead brown sticks that used to be ferns into my wet pocket, hoping some of the dried-out spores have survived. The bogs, when I come to them, are also dried up and dead, with no sign of Kerry violets.\nThe best I can do is fill my other pocket with the serrated-edged leaves and prickly, unripe fruit of a few stunted-looking strawberry trees.\nThen I\u2019m dizzy. I stop to vomit.\nI shouldn\u2019t have gone into the lake.\nAs the rising sun\u2019s touch sets the innocent-looking waters a-sparkle, I stagger out the main gates of the woodland. The ringing in my ears almost drowns out the sound of the dogs barking. The security guards are too afraid to be touching me.\nI wonder if I\u2019m going back to prison to die.\nWhen I wake up in the white-walled hospital ward, still quivering, hard, like the dogs have me in their teeth and won\u2019t stop shaking, I sense vaguely that I\u2019m in the bed beside Miach and that he\u2019s got visitors.\nVisitors? They must be aos s\u00ed.\nMy vision\u2019s blurry.\nI don\u2019t want to turn my head too fast, but I soon realize Miach\u2019s visitors are human, not aos s\u00ed. They\u2019ve brought him flowers. Lots of flowers. They\u2019re not the only ones who have; the head of his bed is surrounded by a sea of carnations and gladioli, tulips and lilies; in short, every kind but the kind that can actually help him. Where is my jacket with the woodland harvest in its pockets? I pat myself down jerkily, only to find I\u2019m naked beneath the hospital gown.\nMiach\u2019s visitors bend solicitously over him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in you,\u201d the man whispers gently. He stands back to make room for the woman, who also murmurs in Miach\u2019s right ear,\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in you.\u201d\nMiach\u2019s face leaps into focus under the fluorescent lights of the ward. In the time I\u2019ve been away, no more than a night and day, the stunning symmetry of his face has been destroyed. On the side where he can hear and see them, his smooth skin\u2019s spotted and withered. Half his head of gleaming yellow hair\u2019s turned brittle and white. His right eye all sunken and pouched.\nAs if he wasn\u2019t sick enough, they are killing the side of him that can understand them. Only the brain-dividing injury done to him by the winner of the All-Ireland Worst Father Prize is keeping him from shriveling up altogether.\n\u201cYou,\u201d I cry, waving my spasming hands at the visitors. \u201cYou leave him be!\u201d\nI throw myself out of bed. Drip lines come loose from my arms in a red spray of blood. The visitors make a hasty retreat, leaving the flowers behind. Pulling myself upright on the plastic safety bars of his bed, I meet Miach\u2019s exhausted, empty-seeming gaze.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to my house,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt\u2019s about two miles from here but it\u2019s safer there. We might have to lean on each other. Get your immortal arse out of that bed.\u201d\nWe don\u2019t go through the public access ways. I take him down the cleaning corridors. He\u2019s a bit useless for me to lean on, seeing as he\u2019s so weak himself, so I procure us a pair of wooden-handled mops and we lean on them as we sneak past the medical waste storage building, under a hedge and across an abandoned, contaminated lot. The sun warms my face but the breeze bites my bum through the open back of the gown.\n\u201cNot far,\u201d I croak. \u201cTurn left.\u201d\nThere it is, over a low brick wall and across a smattering of weeds and uneven pavers. Mossy, shingled awnings. Thin chimneys adorned by the skeletons of dead communication aerials. Cracked plastic downpipes. By the front door is Mam\u2019s terrifying terracotta rabbit with ivy growing out its eyes.\nI don\u2019t even glance up at the second story with the tacked-on external staircase that\u2019s nothing to do with me anymore. Nothing to do with my half home. Only, the two upstairs children, wide-eyed girls with black ponytails and gold stud earrings, are wrestling something up the staircase. They\u2019re grubby, like they\u2019ve been under the house; their tracksuits are covered in dirt and cobwebs.\nThe thing they\u2019re carrying is an enormous, thin, shallow, stainless steel bowl. It must be a meter across. Miach goes very still at the sight of it.\n\u201cWhat you got there?\u201d I call out to them.\n\u201cOur Mam\u2019s salad bowl,\u201d the slightly larger child calls back.\n\u201cWhat you been doing with it?\u201d\n\u201cMaking salad.\u201d\nI\u2019m not as green as I am cabbage.\n\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve really been doing or I\u2019ll get you while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d\nThe larger child\u2019s shoulders stiffen.\n\u201cWe was using it to cover the well,\u201d she answers reluctantly. \u201cOn account of the whispering woman. Hanan don\u2019t like to listen to her when we\u2019re playing mole hospital.\u201d\n\u201cWhat whispering woman?\u201d I demand to know. I\u2019m losing my grip on the mop. I need to lie down. This whole conversation is exhausting and I\u2019m dying. I don\u2019t have time. \u201cWhat well?\u201d\n\u201cThe well under the house what\u2019s got the whispering woman inside. She\u2019s warning her brother to stay away. She says if he comes home, their father will chop him into pieces again,\u201d the bigger girl says matter-of-factly, blowing her fringe out of her eyes. \u201cMy name is Shafyaa. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\nThey were using the salad bowl to cover the well.\nJaysus.\nWhat the upstairs children\u2019s names mean:\n- Hanan \u2013 means kind, compassionate, tender-hearted.\n- Shafyaa \u2013 means a healer, one who cures others.\nThe well\u2019s full of live salmon and fallen hazelnuts.\nI don\u2019t know how either of those things are possible, but I see them in the light filtering through the smashed windows of the sunroom.\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it with your hands,\u201d Miach instructs. Instead, he dips into it with a wooden bowl and pours the water over my head. I get the same cold shock from it as I got from the lake water, but at the same time it feels like my heart is zipping up in my chest, recovering from a sword-blow I never knew was there.\nWe kneel in the dirt by the stone rim in the jaggedly dangerous circle of ripped-up floorboards we made. Miach pours a bowl of water over himself, next. I expect the aged, ruined half of his face to heal, but it stays the same.\nOnly the grill scars from the shopping trolley and the wounds left by the hammer wash instantly away.\nHe looks at his reflection in the water. I look at it, too, and receive a second shock when I realize that his face, even better than the face of a person I could fuck, is the face of a person I could learn to like. Maybe even to trust.\n\u201cI can\u2019t go through,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father\u2019s still waiting on the other side.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better stay here,\u201d I agree. \u201cA face like that belongs in the house of half mirrors.\u201d\nEvidence I\u2019m actually mostly Mam (my better half):\n- I stopped stealing from the mother upstairs. I even told her about it and apologized. She said she knew what I was doing but was too afraid of me to complain. I was the kind of person who smashed windows and mirrors. The kind of person who stole from the upstairs neighbors.\nI am not that kind of person any more. It helps that I like eating salmon.\n- That upstairs lady makes a mean salad.\n- Miach poured a bowl of water over each of my hazel-tree skeletons. They came back to life. Apparently they were always still alive in the land of youth. I\u2019m not sure if I believe that.\nBut I believe Mam loved me while she was alive. A woman like that doesn\u2019t love people for no reason. So there must be something in me worth loving.\n- Nobody dies of cancer in our hospital anymore. I\u2019d fix it so everyone got a share of our well-water but I don\u2019t have time, except to spike the hospital supply. I\u2019m not Santy, to get around to every house, though I\u2019d appreciate a few of Santy\u2019s mince pies and glasses of Guinness.\nThe word is spreading. They even suspect it might be something in the water.\nEvery now and again, one of the ninety-nine will turn up on our doorstep in the middle of the night while I\u2019m away sprinkling the good stuff in the hospital cistern. Miach helps them get to where they\u2019re going, if their aim is to go back. Sometimes they just want to drink from the wooden bowl or to eat one of the salmon.\n- Miach doesn\u2019t want to fuck me and it\u2019s OK. I noticed after a few months that the mirror-halves in the house seemed to be finding one another and joining back up into wholes. Even the wardrobe mirror. Even the sunglasses.\nOf course they would do that, I told Mam\u2019s memory while I flooded the roots of her hazel trees with sacred well-water. There\u2019s an aos s\u00ed healer in the house.\nMiach said it was nothing to do with him, and nothing to do with uncovering the well, either.\nWhen you focus on the good things, even though the world is full of shite, you spiral up, up, up above the madness, into the light, where new hazel branches reach for the sun and the upstairs shitehawks shouting about the clouds being shaped like moles or salmon are so loud that you can\u2019t hear the warning whispers from the well.\nThoraiya Dyer is an Aurealis and Ditmar Award-winning Australian writer and veterinarian.

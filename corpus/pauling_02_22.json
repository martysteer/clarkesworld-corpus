Patient is a thirty-nine-year-old female. C-could you state your name for the record?\n PATIENT \u201cBLUE\u201d: Sure! I\u2019m [BLUE]. Is this, like, really formal?\n TECHNICIAN: Um. Fairly. C-can you tell me about any reservations you have regarding the procedure?\n BLUE: Probably what I\u2019m most, like, nervous about\u2014besides learning how to walk again [laughs]\u2014is that my new body\u2019s neural pathways won\u2019t be developed right for engineering work. Not that I work since getting married. But you know. I like keeping up with nanomaterials and stuff.\n [pause]\n BLUE: Oh, but I\u2019m, like, totally on board.\n TECHNICIAN: Great. I just n-need to ensure that you understand the medical risks before we schedule. Firstly, we strongly recommend against pursuing repeated swaps, which would increase your risk of d-developing epilepsy or Alzheimer\u2019s in later life.\n BLUE: No problem there. I don\u2019t think my husband would, like, pay for me to swap back. [laughs] He\u2019s really excited.\n TECHNICIAN: Recording n-new consent document with primary sponsor of procedure number 228. [SPONSOR], I\u2019m just going to ensure you understand the medical risks to your wife.\n SPONSOR: We went through the think-pack. Obviously, we think it\u2019s fine.\n TECHNICIAN: She and [RED] will experience significant side effects as they habituate to each other\u2019s neurology. They\u2019ll have to essentially retrain themselves to interact with the world. N-nausea, visual or auditory hallucinations, loss of control of bodily functions. Some patients experience d-dysmorphic distress, which can be transitory or\u2014\n SPONSOR: Do we have to go through it all? My wife and I have the resources to get her back on her feet.\n TECHNICIAN: I d-don\u2019t doubt that, but I still need to walk you through the\u2014\n SPONSOR: She\u2019ll be fine after a week or so, right? In [RED]\u2019s body? Healthy; full of energy?\n TECHNICIAN: Probably, but\u2014\n SPONSOR: Then we\u2019ll be fine. Listen, is [RED] going to be here today? Can I see her? Get her autograph?\n TECHNICIAN: C-could you state your name for the record?\n PATIENT \u201cRED\u201d: Oh, honey. You know my name.\n TECHNICIAN: N-n-nevertheless\u2014\n RED: Chill out, you\u2019re making me nervous. Figured you\u2019d be used to interacting with celebrities by now. I mean, you have to be rich as God to shell out for this. Like [SPONSOR].\n TECHNICIAN: Well, we\u2019re c-contracted by organizations more often than individuals.\n RED: You mean spies and shit? Deep cover face changing shit?\n TECHNICIAN: Um. I\u2019m unable to disclose\u2014\n RED: [laughs] Oh my god. Maybe that\u2019s who I should\u2019ve swapped with instead. Some James Bond lady instead of a past-sell-by wife due for a flesh upgrade.\n TECHNICIAN: [sputters]\n RED: What a freak, that guy, right? You know he paid me [REDACTED]? That\u2019s more than I\u2019ve made in ten years, just to stick an old trophy wife in his movie star crush\u2019s skin.\n TECHNICIAN: Once we get a \u201cmap\u201d of each of your n-neurologies\u2014basically a freeze-frame\u2014I\u2019ll program the machine. You and [RED] go to sleep, and when you wake up\u2014\n BLUE: Yeah. I get it.\n TECHNICIAN: Are you alright?\n BLUE: People ask if I miss the pageant days, but they never ask if I miss, like . . . all the stuff that came after. You know I was [SPONSOR]\u2019s first technical hire, before he hit it big? That\u2019s how we met. We were so different then. Both of us.\n SPONSOR: Um.\n BLUE: Like, I guess what I\u2019m saying is I miss going in to work in the morning. Doing science. You\u2019re so lucky.\n TECHNICIAN: It\u2019s . . . alright. It\u2019s fine. For me, it was better than the alternative.\n BLUE: But you, like, went to school for this?\n TECHNICIAN: I d-didn\u2019t, actually. It\u2019s kind of a long story. But it\u2019s not hard! Practically automated. You\u2019re in good hands.\n BLUE: I\u2019m so out of date in my field. Tools, techniques, all of it. Like, over a decade off. Even if I wanted to go back to work, I\u2014\n [pause]\n BLUE: Can I ask you something else?\n TECHNICIAN: We really n-need to get through this script.\n BLUE: Oh, sorry. I\u2019m like, always talking too much. That\u2019s what my husband says. Ever since my sister moved to Sydney and the caf\u00e9 in our building shut down it\u2019s been like . . . sorry. I\u2019ll stop.\n TECHNICIAN: N-no, go ahead and ask.\n BLUE: It\u2019s just, maybe you have a read on [RED].\n TECHNICIAN: I n-never have a read on anyone. Fatal weakness.\n [laughter from either BLUE or TECHNICIAN\u2014unclear]\n BLUE: But seriously, why would she agree to trade with me? Like, she gets my old-ass body and a brain that used to be good at microfabrications research. What else? Why would she ever want to, like . . . stop being her?\n TECHNICIAN: I really can\u2019t disclose c-content from these sessions.\n BLUE: I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve asked. Just . . . you seem nice. Like the barista who used to work downstairs. He let me talk to him for as long as I needed to. During the day, when I was alone.\n TECHNICIAN: Trophy wife? Please don\u2019t call her that.\n RED: Hey, no offense intended. It\u2019s a solid gig! Hell, I considered it for a hot second before my breakthrough role. Just . . . intoxicating some yacht party with my presence until a powerful creature can\u2019t help but take me home. You ever thought about what that would be like?\n TECHNICIAN: . . . Yes.\n RED: You mean you\u2019ve pictured it, in your head?\n TECHNICIAN: Yes.\n RED: [laughs] Damn, boy! Knew this mouse had a material side. I\u2019m never wrong about these things.\n TECHNICIAN: I\u2019m n-not saying\u2014\n RED: Anyway, listen, she\u2019ll get plenty of love once the tabloids get wind that I\u2019ve donated my rack to her cause. If I were her, I\u2019d divorce [SPONSOR]\u2019s nasty ass right after and have some fun.\n TECHNICIAN: Do you think she\u2019ll do that? D-divorce him?\n [pause]\n RED: Don\u2019t sound so hopeful, honey. Sometimes people get stuck.\n TECHNICIAN: There\u2019s no reason she can\u2019t\u2014\n RED: She can walk away, but she can\u2019t leave. You want somebody to leave, give them something to run toward.\n [pause]\n RED: You know I can tell a lot about people, just by looking at them? I can feel their feelings and shit? My mom called it \u201chyperempathy.\u201d Your think-pack said it was a highly developed EQ.\n TECHNICIAN: Yes. It\u2019s a c-competency not many people have. I\u2019m envious. I\u2019ve always wanted\u2014\n RED: I\u2019ve spent my life trying to shut that shit out. It follows me closer than the damn paparazzi, or the kids on my feed who think they\u2019re in love with me. I can feel that shit on my skin. I can walk away, but I can\u2019t leave.\n TECHNICIAN: I don\u2019t understand.\n RED: I\u2019m ready to pilot that lady\u2019s big engineer brain straight to my expensive new private island and solve Rubik\u2019s Cubes for the rest of my life. Or lock myself alone in a room and cure cancer or something. She can keep the EQ for all I care if it means I can be alone for once. Alone on the streets, in my own brain, whatever. Both. Either.\n [pause]\n RED: I mean, she\u2019s lucky, right? Everyone\u2019s forgotten her name.\n TECHNICIAN: Last question: why are you undergoing this procedure?\n [pause]\n BLUE: What do you mean?\n TECHNICIAN: I just n-need an answer. Please. Tell me you have a reason to do this. Tell me that you want it.\n BLUE: I . . . I want to.\n TECHNICIAN: If you weren\u2019t married\u2014or if you left him, or he d-died one day\u2014would you still want this? Would you still want to live in her body? Fight off tabloids forever?\n BLUE: Yeah.\n TECHNICIAN: What if you had a better option?\n BLUE: Yeah no, this is like, a life changing opportunity. Or whatever.\n [pause]\n BLUE: Stop making that face, goddammit! Stop pitying me.\n TECHNICIAN: I d-don\u2019t pity you. I would love to have your life.\n BLUE: No you wouldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t lie to me.\n TECHNICIAN: I\u2019m serious! The resources. The body you\u2019re about to have. Her people-reading skills; the d-development of her anterior insula and her ACC.\n [pause]\n TECHNICIAN: C-can I tell you something? My life before this job wasn\u2019t good. I worked in a corporate lab and trusted the wrong guy. Got blackmailed. K-kept being forced into situations I couldn\u2019t control. Then I met someone here who offered me a choice. The same choice someone else gave him.\n BLUE: Must be nice, all these choices.\n TECHNICIAN: What I\u2019m saying is, this job\u2014this life\u2014wasn\u2019t my first.\n BLUE: Well, sorry if I don\u2019t feel bad that you get to spend all day doing\u2014\n TECHNICIAN: I d-didn\u2019t develop this stutter as a child.\n BLUE: Okay?\n TECHNICIAN: Someone else did.\n [pause]\n BLUE: Huh.\n [Investigator\u2019s note: approx. eight minutes are unrecoverable due to audio file corruption. Note potential tampering.]\n TECHNICIAN: Thank you, we\u2019re c-clear to proceed. Are you alright with scheduling for two months out?\n BLUE: Sure! God, I wish you really were my barista. I think we\u2019d have a lot to talk about.\n TECHNICIAN: Okay, people, time for final consent! This is, like, the last possible moment for takesies-backsies. [RED], how we f-feelin\u2019?\n RED: Golden. I consent to the procedure. Honey, you okay? You seem . . .\n TECHNICIAN: Ready to go! F-f-full of energy. I was sick for, like, a week? But now I feel brand new. I\u2019ve already thought of, like, a ton of improvements I w-wanna make to this procedure. \u201cAutomated\u201d my ass.\n RED: Huh . . . you don\u2019t say. Good for you.\n TECHNICIAN: F-fill me in, [BLUE]. You ready to, like, start a new life? Become the b-b-beautiful lady you see beside you?\n BLUE: Um. Yes. I consent. I\u2019m ready\u2014I think I\u2019ve been ready my whole life.\n TECHNICIAN: Awesome. Thank you. Now it\u2019s f-finally\u2014finally\u2014time for me to do some goddamn science.

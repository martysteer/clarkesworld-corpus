So when Katherine arrived at my bedside, I couldn\u2019t help reflecting that she was the last woman in my life. It had ended a year ago; she preferred the aliens\u2019 company to mine. But still\u2014\n \u201cKath, would you kiss me?\u201d\n We had not parted on kissing terms. Nonetheless, she bent down and kissed me with an echo of our old passion. I savored the closeness, the taste of her, as her long dark hair tickled my neck. Now I had a chance to exorcise the resentment I\u2019d hoarded since we split. Katherine was my last love, and I wanted to reconcile with her while I still could.\n She couldn\u2019t hide her shock at seeing my shriveled body. Once I climbed mountains; now I could no longer climb out of bed.\n \u201cOh, Lucian,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is awful. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get here earlier. I\u2019ve been working like a slave lately.\u201d\n I suppressed a grimace at her alien idiom, and instead gestured at the hospice walls decorated with holos from family back on Earth and friends scattered across space. My mountaineering colleagues had sent pictures of the virgin peaks they\u2019d conquered on frontier worlds. I\u2019d added my own best ascents to create a collage of galactic summits in vast enigmatic skies, a climber\u2019s vision of heaven. \u201cThis is how I\u2019m dying. How do the Ardissans do it?\u201d I asked, offering Katherine the olive branch of a chance to talk about her favorite subject.\n \u201cThey eat this.\u201d She gave me a pot of green paste that looked like moldy guacamole. \u201cActually, they eat it every day anyway. But in your circumstances\u201d\u2014she winced as she alluded to my condition\u2014\u201cthey would abandon all other food, and eat only this. It helps them prepare for the transition.\u201d\n I accepted the sour-smelling paste with little enthusiasm. Yet for Katherine\u2019s sake I ate a few spoonfuls. The green sludge had a peppery tang.\n Katherine said, \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018wathrone,\u2019 which means \u2018spirit sight.\u2019\u201d She explained that the Ardissans constantly sought guidance from their ancestors\u2019 ghosts. I struggled to concentrate as she described her research into the aliens\u2019 religion. Her lecture reminded me of our field trips to their squalid villages, where funeral pyres so often billowed smoke over the stone huts.\n A faint blue wisp appeared high above my bed. Katherine noticed my gaze. \u201cThis is Orlind,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the elders.\u201d\n Like a fuzzy hologram resolving into focus, the figure imprinted itself on my vision. It was an Ardissan, a junior male: he had small stubs of antlers on his bearlike body. His fur was the deep blue of the sky at twilight.\n \u201cHow\u2019d he get in here?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd why is he floating?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I\u2019m dead,\u201d said the alien. \u201cThat\u2019s what your woman has been trying to tell you. We elders hover above to symbolize our higher wisdom.\u201d\n \u201cHigher wisdom?\u201d I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a bunch of Stone Age primitives.\u201d\n Then the incongruity of the situation sank in, finally penetrating through the meds that wrapped my brain in cotton wool. \u201cHe\u2019s really dead?\u201d I asked Katherine. \u201cAnd this wathrone stuff lets us talk to him?\u201d\n She nodded. \u201cThe Ardissans kept telling me about their afterlife, but I didn\u2019t understand until I ate the wathrone myself. It explains so much\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAmazing,\u201d I said. In my weakened state, my exclamation sounded feeble, an inadequate response to something so momentous. I wished I had more energy to congratulate Katherine, to drink a celebratory toast and dance with her. I tried to strengthen my voice as I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a discovery\u2014it\u2019ll make your reputation.\u201d\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s just the first harvest.\u201d From her hold-all, Katherine took out a gray box with mesh air vents. \u201cI won\u2019t show you what\u2019s inside just yet, so as not to bias your expectations. But watch carefully.\u201d\n She lifted the lid a fraction, and reached in. I couldn\u2019t see what she did, but it only took a few moments. She closed the box with an air of finality.\n Soon I saw something emerge. A hazy four-legged shape floated up through the lid, and hovered in midair. The wispy form coalesced into tortoiseshell fur with a snarling feline face, and legs that scrabbled as though trying to catch purchase on something. It looked like a cat, like any of a million cats back on crowded old Earth\u2014the world of my birth but not of my death.\n The cat yowled. I expected the hospice nurses to burst in, but no one came. The plaintive cry wasn\u2019t a physical sound; I only sensed it through the wathrone, the same way I\u2019d heard the alien. The cat screeched again, its legs still twitching. Then it hurtled away through the back wall.\n The sight made me shiver. It felt acutely wrong, far more so than the phantom Ardissan. Aliens were alien, after all, and might do anything. But the ghost cat violated my sense of the natural order.\n Katherine opened the box with the flourish of a magician concluding a showpiece trick. It contained a dead tortoiseshell cat with a bandaged head. A used syringe rolled beside the cat\u2019s front legs.\n I didn\u2019t know whether to applaud or vomit. \u201cYou killed that cat right in front of me?\u201d\n \u201cI gave an old, sick cat an afterlife, which otherwise it wouldn\u2019t have had,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cI needed a demonstration, or you\u2019d never have believed it.\u201d\n \u201cThe cat\u2019s ghost? I still don\u2019t believe it! How did that happen?\u201d\n \u201cThe aliens have a ghost-gland called an \u2018akran.\u2019 If they die with it intact, like Orlind\u201d\u2014she gestured to the alien, who was still watching us from the ceiling\u2014\u201cthey become an elder. But the akran can be removed, to prevent someone entering the afterlife. It can also be transplanted. The Ardissans have long done this among themselves and their livestock. So I experimented with transplanting into animals from Earth.\u201d\n I sank into the pillow, as if it would block out her next words.\n \u201cI knew you were dying,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cThat\u2019s why I pushed the research so hard.\u201d Her voice sounded almost as tired and weak as my own.\n Sweat prickled on my neck. I took deep shuddering breaths, and my frail chest stung with pain. \u201cJust to be clear about this\u2014you\u2019re offering me the chance to be resurrected like that cat? Into an alien afterlife?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d said Katherine, clasping my hand. \u201cI know it\u2019s a shock, and you\u2019ll have lots of questions. Orlind will tell you what it\u2019s like to become an elder.\u201d\n Flummoxed by this bizarre offer, I wondered what the catch was. \u201cYou said the ghost-gland was transplanted. Does that mean I can only enter the afterlife if someone else misses out? And someone lost their resurrection so you could demonstrate it on a cat? That sounds . . . exploitative.\u201d\n Katherine shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. When you see where the akranil come from, you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s completely fair. Everything I do is vetted by an ethics review board, or I wouldn\u2019t be able to publish.\u201d\n She picked up the gray case with its grisly cargo. \u201cTalk to Orlind, then think it over.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re leaving already?\u201d I said, hating how plaintive my voice sounded. But I might not see her again before I died.\n \u201cI have to get some sleep before I collapse,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how hard I\u2019ve been working. I\u2019ll come back, but is there anything else you need right now?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . . \u201d I sighed. \u201cI wanted to talk, that\u2019s all. Go over old times, and sort some things out.\u201d\n Katherine smiled. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for that. You\u2019re not on a deadline anymore. When you\u2019ve ascended, we can talk as much as you like.\u201d\n \u201cIf I\u2019ve ascended,\u201d I said, but Katherine\u2014already opening the door\u2014didn\u2019t hear me. She gave me a crossed-arms goodbye salute as she left.\n She\u2019d adopted many of the Ardissans\u2019 habits over the years. Would the same happen to me? If I entered their afterlife, would I stay human, or become alien?\n I\u2019d never been religious, not even when the hospice chaplain tried to tempt me on my deathbed. It had all sounded so vague and insubstantial. Now the Ardissan version looked a lot more vivid and disturbing.\n \u201cGive me the sales pitch,\u201d I said to the patiently floating figure. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like being dead?\u201d\n \u201cThere are many different roles,\u201d said Orlind. \u201cWarriors argue tactics and plan campaigns; oracles consult omens; storytellers create vast collective sagas. There are games of strategy and chance. The philosophers discuss morals, determining the correct action for every circumstance. Indeed, the favorite pastime of the elders is telling the groundlings what to do.\u201d\n I detected an overtone of bitterness. \u201cBut you\u2019re an elder yourself,\u201d I said.\n \u201cOnly the eldest rule. More recent arrivals have lesser status.\u201d Orlind pointed to his small stubs of antlers. \u201cI have least of all, because when I walked the paths of the earth, I rebelled against my family spirits. I killed myself before they could remove my akran, but then I was ostracized in the higher realm. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here\u2014I\u2019ve long observed humans. When your woman ate the wathrone, I learned human speech and became her mentor.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s called Katherine.\u201d\n \u201cYes. It is an odd custom you have, letting your women have their own names and walk about by themselves.\u201d\n The aliens\u2019 own customs had sounded backward when Katherine described them. Their society was static, ruled by ancient elders; they had no notion of science or civilization. I\u2019d often felt that the Ardissans seemed unworthy of Katherine\u2019s attention.\n Orlind babbled on, talking of the benefits of the afterlife: the accumulation of wisdom, the bliss of advanced meditation. \u201cNo need to find food every day. No need to suffer pain with every illness and injury\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe have painkillers for that,\u201d I said, grateful not to have endured an Ardissan life so wretched that death perhaps came as a relief.\n \u201cBut you\u2019re still dying,\u201d Orlind said.\n Touch\u00e9. Soon Orlind faded, his voice diminishing into scratchy subliminal whispers as my wathrone dose wore off.\n The next day, Katherine arrived carrying a med-kit emblazoned with the snowflake logo of chilled tissue-samples. I guessed what lay inside.\n \u201cI may be in the anteroom, but I\u2019m not at death\u2019s door yet,\u201d I said.\n \u201cBut why take the chance?\u201d said Katherine. \u201cYou could suffer a relapse any minute.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a cheerful thought to brighten my last days . . . . \u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re not your last days.\u201d\n \u201cOh, but they are,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, and I do appreciate your efforts, but I don\u2019t want this afterlife.\u201d\n Katherine looked nonplussed, as if I\u2019d torn up a winning lottery ticket. \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t sound like somewhere I\u2019d want to spend a wet weekend, never mind forever.\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it better than the alternative?\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cI keep thinking about that poor cat\u2014you brought it back, but it\u2019s never going to purr on anyone\u2019s lap again. What can it possibly do now?\u201d\n \u201cYou have more mental resources than a cat,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cYou\u2019ll find new interests. Orlind told you what the elders do.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2019m not an alien,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you mean well, yet you\u2019re so close to the Ardissans, you don\u2019t realize how most people think of them. To me they\u2019re just a bunch of savages too stupid to develop technology and so backward they don\u2019t even give women their own names.\u201d\n \u201cEventually, other humans will join you.\u201d\n \u201cAre the aliens happy with that?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo they have enough spare glands for the whole human race?\u201d\n Katherine waved this aside. \u201cWe can figure out how to synthesize the akranil. And we\u2019ll agree something with the Ardissans. Surely the afterlife is bigger than just this planet. You can explore and find out!\u201d\n \u201cSounds like a tough job. They\u2019re pretty warlike, you always said. I bet they can make it hellish for their enemies.\u201d\n She gave me a disappointed look. \u201cThe old Lucian had a more positive attitude\u2014that\u2019s what I loved about him. No mountain ever scared you.\u201d\n \u201cAnd death doesn\u2019t scare me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve faced the end of my days, and come to terms with it. But you seem to think I should be so afraid of death as to chase any alternative.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not just afraid of the alternative?\u201d\n I opened my mouth to deny it, then paused. I\u2019d invested a lot of effort in accepting mortality, in tying up the loose ends of my life. Had I tried so hard to face death that I embraced it unnecessarily?\n Katherine\u2019s arguments swept down on me like an avalanche. \u201cYou were always so proud of being the first to climb a new summit. Now you can be the first human in the afterlife, the trailblazer for all those who follow. Think of the millions of people across the galaxy who are dying every day\u2014don\u2019t they deserve another option? They need an informed opinion, a guide who\u2019s brave enough to meet the ancient spirits and confront whatever lies beyond.\n \u201cIf you find the best path for ascending the afterlife, you\u2019ll be remembered forever. I\u2019ve been working so hard on this because I wanted to save you, and give you the honor of being the eldest of all the human elders.\u201d\n Eagerness shone on her face. I realized that if I rejected Katherine\u2019s offer, I would be rejecting Katherine all over again. I\u2019d longed to reconcile with her, but I\u2019d foolishly imagined doing it on my terms. I had to give some ground, too. Otherwise I would die while stuck in the old mire of resentment and regret.\n \u201cKath, I\u2019m sorry for doubting you. If you really think this is worthwhile, then go ahead.\u201d I closed my eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll start one last climb into the unknown.\u201d\n \u201cKing of diamonds and queen of clubs,\u201d I said, after floating back through the test chamber\u2019s layers of shielding.\n \u201cKing of diamonds and queen of clubs,\u201d repeated Xavier for the benefit of the experiment\u2019s recordings. Katherine\u2019s research assistant had consumed wathrone to hear me; my ghostly form didn\u2019t register on any mechanical sensors. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough for today.\u201d\n \u201cDid I pass?\u201d I asked sardonically. \u201cDo I exist?\u201d\n \u201cFor me, sure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they\u2019ll think back on Earth\u2014who knows?\u201d\n I was in no rush to persuade anyone. I\u2019d agreed to the tests because I understood the importance of scientific verification; but having only just dipped my toe into the afterlife, I wasn\u2019t yet ready to summon a press conference to say, \u201cCome on in, the water\u2019s fine!\u201d\n Xavier closed up the lab, and left to take a shower before his evening gig at the Retro Lounge. Before I died, I\u2019d never noticed just how many hours people spent on mundane activities such as washing and eating and sleeping. I needed none of those, and the empty time weighed me down.\n The nights were the worst. I had no bed, no rest, no dreams to pass the slow dark hours. I could watch TV, but not change the channel. I could watch the whole life of the town, but not take part. Another night loomed before me like an enormous, implacable glacier.\n I darted around the complex, knowing that somewhere Katherine would still be at work. I found her composing yet another paper for Xenology Review. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cI\u2019m on deadline,\u201d she said, without pausing. \u201cJust let me get this done.\u201d\n I waited an hour, reading over her shoulder, until she broke off for a drink and a snack.\n \u201cRemember our first trip out?\u201d I said. \u201cWhen the flitter broke down\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI do, but we\u2019ve already talked about all that,\u201d said Katherine, gently dismissing my attempts at reminiscence.\n \u201cI\u2019ve only been dead a week,\u201d I said. \u201cHave you tired of me so quickly?\u201d\n \u201cNo, but I can\u2019t spend all day chatting,\u201d she said. \u201cI have work to do. We all do\u2014even you.\u201d\n \u201cXavier\u2019s clocked off. And we\u2019ve finished the tests.\u201d\n \u201cThen why are you still here?\u201d\n \u201cWhere would I go?\u201d\n \u201cAnywhere. There\u2019s a whole world outside\u2014maybe a whole galaxy beyond.\u201d\n \u201cBut . . . . \u201d I didn\u2019t want to say it: The aliens are out there. I imagined them like yetis lurking on high slopes, waiting for unwary mountaineers to leave the safety of base camp.\n Katherine knew me well enough to guess my thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet them eventually,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can discover their customs, learn how they navigate the afterlife\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnother project for you to write up,\u201d I said. I had always come second to her work in life; why had I thought that things would change in death? I was just another research assistant, in convenient spirit form.\n Yet she was right. I couldn\u2019t hide forever. I must meet the Ardissans eventually, and I\u2019d need to understand them.\n That night I sought out Orlind and asked him to teach me his language.\n \u201cCome close to me,\u201d he said.\n I drifted nearer until our ghostly essences met, with the slightest of tingles on my nonexistent flesh. I began to hear his mind, at first as an indistinct mutter. Then his thoughts became clearer. I sensed his fascination with human technology, and his frank interest in me as a novelty. Underneath this lay weariness and ennui. I felt him delve for memories of when he learned to speak. He pushed them toward me.\n For an instant, a deluge of language poured into me, along with a torrent of childhood events and emotions. I recoiled. The connection was overwhelming, almost drowning my identity. I flinched with instinctive revulsion, and we broke apart. I was embarrassed at my reaction; he bore it phlegmatically.\n The language lessons continued with less intimate instruction. It took time, but we had plenty of that. Orlind took me on a long journey to show me where Katherine acquired her akranil. We floated through thunderstorms without a shiver. I drank in the sights of lakes and valleys, though the familiar vistas reminded me painfully of better times with Katherine. Our shared love of Ardissa\u2019s vast hinterland\u2014beyond the human huddle of Greenfall Station\u2014had originally brought us together, and we\u2019d often traveled for her fieldwork and my mountaineering. Katherine updated the planetary gazetteer with the natives\u2019 place names and local lore, while I added my observations as an amateur scientist and professional adventurer. We bonded as we riffed off each other\u2019s contributions, with remarks too frivolous for the official record.\n I\u2019d always filmed my expeditions. On Ardissa, I compiled montages of Katherine and I traveling across the planet, talking about everything and nothing, exchanging banter and falling for each other. She encouraged me to film her, in case her research grants ran out and she had to reinvent herself as a celebrity xenologist. We joked about this, taking turns to impersonate TV announcers on sleazy shows. \u201cTonight on BizarroScape, out-of-this-world sex\u2014do aliens have better orgasms?\u201d\n The idyll didn\u2019t last. I began to resent how she was always knee-deep in research, while Katherine complained that I treated her as just another conquest alongside the planet\u2019s virgin summits. When we broke up, I channeled my anger into daredevil climbing feats\u2014and pushed myself too far.\n Now I relived those memories: the heat of the volcano, the noxious smell of its fumes, the fall that punctured my lung, and the festering infection that finished me off. More painful still were recollections of Katherine, from fondly treasured moments to the final tense exchanges. I told her that she worked too hard and spent too much time with the aliens; she protested that I didn\u2019t take her work seriously, that I looked down on the Ardissans and therefore on her. How I wanted to take back those words, and start again . . . .\n Orlind snapped me out of this stupefying daze with his regular language drills. But I knew I couldn\u2019t always count on external rescue. I needed to find my own path through the fog of self-recrimination, and signpost the way for anyone who might follow.\n Afterlife Gazetteer\u2014The Swamp of Regrets. Ghostly existence lacks the sensual immediacy of a living, breathing body. Your memories may become more vivid than the world around you. It\u2019s tempting to wallow in recollections of life, but they can trap you, sucking you into the if-onlys and the remember-whens and the why-didn\u2019t-I\u2019s . . . . Wallowing in the past is dangerous because you\u2019re retreating from the present, and it can\u2019t change anything. You\u2019re dead. Deal with it.\n I dealt with it by focusing on the language lessons while we traveled across the planet. Because the elders had ostracized Orlind, our route avoided populated areas. Nevertheless I caught glimpses of farms and villages, which looked just as primitive as I remembered from Katherine\u2019s research trips. Orlind confirmed that the Ardissans didn\u2019t practice crop rotation, fertilization with manure, or other such procedures commonplace on Earth. In a form of ancestor worship, the elders held the race\u2019s entire store of wisdom, and directed every detail of the groundlings\u2019 lives. They discouraged innovation; the most senior were the most conservative, those who\u2019d lived in the remotest past and considered it a golden age. The living didn\u2019t defy the elders, not if they wanted to reach the afterlife themselves. Rebels, criminals, and slaves were forbidden to ascend, while any warrior who let himself be captured was considered too cowardly to become an elder.\n At last we reached our destination, a group of stone buildings on a snowy plateau, far from any other habitation. It had the air of a remote monastery, albeit with the defensive walls and ditches of a castle, as though doctrine was fiercely contested.\n Orlind identified this stronghold as Mallarn. \u201cThere are no elders here, other than rare visitors like us, but you can meet the groundlings and learn why they sell their akranil.\u201d\n He entered in search of someone who could see him, and returned to say, \u201cArnil has invited us to the banquet tonight, when they will eat wathrone and talk with us.\u201d\n Mentally worn out after the long journey, I wished I could sleep for a while, but I\u2019d left that behind along with my body. Instead I dropped into a trance until the shadows lengthened.\n Afterlife Gazetteer\u2014The Abyss of Sleep. As a ghost it\u2019s hard to rest at all, never mind rest in peace. If you try to sleep, you just sink slowly into a fathomless abyss without ever reaching the bottom. It\u2019s better to meditate and empty your mind. Remember how you used to breathe, and imagine your form gently pulsing with each inhalation and exhalation . . . .\n In the evening I followed Orlind to the banquet hall, where I saw a spread laid out: roasted meat, dried fruit, a few spices. The feast was not especially impressive by human standards, but here it was surely a cornucopia.\n Indeed, some of the Ardissans were extremely fat. Others came into the hall staggering as if drunk or drugged; and yet others entered arm in arm, in pairs or threes or fours, pawing and nuzzling each other. Everyone had a scar on their neck: they\u2019d shaved their fur to display it.\n \u201cThe scar is from removing the akran,\u201d Orlind explained.\n I wondered which Ardissan had provided the akran that resurrected me, and if it made any difference. Katherine had surely kept records.\n \u201cWelcome to our feast!\u201d said the leader, Arnil. He had the biggest antlers and the fattest belly of them all.\n We could not, of course, partake. \u201cAre they trying to make some kind of point?\u201d I asked Orlind.\n \u201cThey often eat like this,\u201d Orlind said. \u201cKatherine pays them with food.\u201d\n I\u2019d finally convinced him to call Katherine by name. I remembered her saying that food was the least disruptive reward\u2014the least colonialist intervention\u2014she could give the natives in return for their help.\n Arnil led his followers in a toast. \u201cTo pleasure!\u201d At this word, uttered with a suffix indicating holiness, the revelers raised their cups and downed the contents. Then the banquet began.\n \u201cHow are you finding the afterlife?\u201d Arnil asked me, as he selected precise combinations of spiced meat and fruit.\n \u201cChallenging,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWhy have you renounced it?\u201d If they were happy to sell the ghost-gland, was it really worth buying?\n \u201cBecause the sole satisfaction of the dead is to interfere with the living. There\u2019s no other pleasure in the afterlife, is there?\u201d Arnil sucked droplets of grease from the fur on his thick, fleshy arms. Where he couldn\u2019t reach, his followers licked him clean.\n \u201cIt\u2019s true that we don\u2019t have the pleasures of the table or the bed,\u201d Orlind said. \u201cThere are intellectual pursuits . . . . \u201d\n Arnil snorted. \u201cMore meat!\u201d he called. \u201cThese insipid spirits make me hungry just looking at them.\u201d\n Orlind told me, \u201cThe elders rarely come here: there\u2019s no point, as these groundlings have made the ultimate rebellion. But Mallarn appreciates the occasional visit from renegades like myself, to confirm that the afterlife really is devoid of the pleasures they value. They love flaunting their diversions before those who can\u2019t enjoy them.\u201d\n \u201cAre there lots of rebels?\u201d I asked, wondering if I\u2019d been suckered into an afterlife that most of the planet disdained.\n \u201cNo,\u201d Orlind replied. \u201cThese are a few mavericks, despised by the rest of the world. Most decent folk won\u2019t bring themselves down to the level of slaves and criminals.\u201d\n As the evening progressed, the feasters indulged themselves to the point of uncontrolled excretion\u2014the Ardissan equivalent of vomiting. The amorous rutted in the spaces between the tables, or on the tables in the remains of the food. And everyone drank and drank, though it took them a long time to get drunk. The crude clay vessels contained a weakly fermented fruit juice.\n \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything stronger than that?\u201d I asked Arnil as he led yet another toast.\n \u201cIt\u2019s traditional, from Ulbim\u2019s clan.\u201d Arnil pointed to one of his fellows.\n I approached Ulbim and suggested that the beverage could be made stronger. Since I owed my ghostly existence to Mallarn\u2019s hedonists, I wanted to repay them by helping in some way, and I couldn\u2019t give them food as Katherine had done.\n \u201cIt\u2019s my ancestors\u2019 recipe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have drunk it for as many generations as there are stars in the sky. And you suggest we change it? You have no rightful standing\u2014you soil the afterlife with your presence.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m only trying to help. And why do you care whether I pollute the afterlife? I thought you all despised it.\u201d I pointed to the scar he bore.\n His muzzle wrinkled in disgust. \u201cWe\u2019re not all the same. Everyone here has renounced the afterlife, but for different reasons. I was a sinner, unworthy to enter the higher realm, so I exiled myself. But how can you be worthy? Did you obey the elders and live by the precepts of honor?\u201d\n \u201cProbably not your idea of honor,\u201d I said, thinking of the vast gulf between human and Ardissan lifestyles.\n \u201cThen you should never have been allowed to ascend.\u201d He stalked away, then turned to cry, \u201cI shit on your grandfather\u2019s bones!\u201d\n \u201cNever mind him,\u201d said an Ardissan without antlers. \u201cWe love our pleasures\u2014if there are stronger drinks, we want to hear about it. What do you suggest?\u201d\n I appreciated this more receptive attitude. \u201cNow that it\u2019s winter,\u201d I said, \u201cyou could try leaving fermented drinks outside overnight. That should give them more bite.\u201d\n My interlocutor was Ranis-tra-Laru\u2014a description roughly meaning \u201cbrewer.\u201d Females lacked antlers and hence lacked status; she did not have a name, only a current task. Despite the mutiny against the elders, Mallarn still allocated labor by traditional gender roles.\n When the next frost arrived, I taught the brewer how to strengthen drinks by freezing them and discarding the water-ice, leaving the alcohol behind. The following feast grew wilder and drunker than ever before. The banqueters toasted Ranis-tra-Laru, while Ulbim brooded at the perversion of his ancestral recipes.\n Orlind took me aside. \u201cCongratulations on your first harvest. Throwing away the ice! This whole world is ice-bound, frozen in the customs of generations past. Banishing that ice would be a grand project.\u201d\n \u201cSounds like a lot of work,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThen how else will you spend your days? If you want more choices, you need more company. Now that you\u2019ve had a longer taste of the afterlife, isn\u2019t it time you told Katherine you\u2019re doing fine? Every moment you delay, there are humans dying who might prefer another option.\u201d\n I knew that, but I didn\u2019t want to be pressured into a hasty decision. \u201cWhy do you care? Why are you so eager to see humans in the afterlife?\u201d\n \u201cSelf-interest,\u201d Orlind said. \u201cBringing humans will cause change\u2014and from my lowly position, any change is more likely to be an improvement than not.\u201d\n \u201cAh, yes.\u201d I sympathized, remembering Orlind\u2019s ostracism. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon for me to say that the afterlife\u2019s fine. I\u2019d hate to urge people in, only to regret it.\u201d\n \u201cThen take as long as you need,\u201d said Orlind. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when I return.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d I said, horrified at the prospect of being the only ghost in Mallarn. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cI have things to do, places to go, messages to deliver,\u201d he said.\n His evasiveness made me wonder what lay behind his departure. I realized that by teaching the Ardissans how to make stronger drinks, I was directing the groundlings from the afterlife. I had taken on the traditional role of the elders, the role denied cast-out Orlind. Perhaps he felt bitter.\n \u201cYou can help me,\u201d I suggested.\n He made the throwing-away-trash gesture that was the Ardissan equivalent of a head-shake. \u201cThey only listen to you because you\u2019re human, and have new things to tell them. I have no wisdom needed here.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2019ll be alone without you.\u201d Already I felt the crushing weight of countless nights ahead, while the inhabitants of Mallarn slept, and I haunted the stone edifice with nothing to do and no one to talk to.\n \u201cIf you want human company, you have only to give the word.\u201d\n Clearly Orlind felt that abandoning me would make me lonely, hence more likely to urge people into the afterlife. I resolved not to act from such selfishness. Casting about for other companionship, I remembered the tortoiseshell cat that Katherine had resurrected before my death. A pet would be something, at least. I asked Orlind if we could find the cat.\n \u201cI expect it has already been found by the royal coursers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little enough hunting in the afterlife that every scrap of prey is soon seized and swallowed up.\u201d\n This chilled me, and dissuaded me from seeking out other elders until I felt safer in my new form. After Orlind left, I threw myself into the affairs of Mallarn, talking to whoever would speak with me. While some of the residents had renounced the afterlife to the extent of refusing to eat wathrone, others had a more open attitude. Being human aided my acceptance, as I wasn\u2019t part of the oppressive hierarchy of elders. Even so, I had to phrase any advice as a tactful suggestion rather than an order. Yet the groundlings began to welcome my input when they saw that I proposed better ways of doing things, whereas the elders always emphasized tradition.\n From Katherine I\u2019d absorbed the core tenet of xenology: no colonialism. I wasn\u2019t killing the aliens, or bringing disease, or stealing their land. I was only talking to them. And they wanted to hear what I had to say.\n The folk of Mallarn mainly sought new and pleasurable ways to fill their days. I helped them design musical instruments, and explained the principles behind octaves and scales. They already had some basic sports such as foot races and the javelin; I suggested other games, and soon they played football\u2014albeit with the dried, leathery heads of former malefactors. The Ardissans had primitive ideas of justice, with wrongdoers quickly exiled or executed.\n I considered many of the aliens\u2019 customs, such as the subjection of females into anonymous servitude, to be as backward as their farming and sewerage practices. But I couldn\u2019t transform a whole culture overnight. Even the small changes I\u2019d already instigated had caused a few of Mallarn\u2019s inhabitants to leave in disgust.\n New recruits arrived, replacing the dead and departed. I attended the next commitment ceremony, at which the neophytes consumed wathrone, then looked into the afterlife to renounce it. After an elaborate convocation, each bared their neck. Arnil cut deep into their skin and removed a scrap of flesh, red with blood.\n When the neophytes had all surrendered their akranil, they consumed tonics that quenched pain and stoked euphoria. Most of them began a mass rut, celebrating their dedication to pleasure and their abandonment of anything beyond.\n I was about to withdraw\u2014I\u2019d already seen enough of that kind of thing\u2014when I noticed Arnil carrying a pot full of harvested ghost-glands. I followed him outside, where I saw a flitter parked on the plateau, and a human figure unloading crates of food.\n \u201cKatherine!\u201d I exclaimed.\n She crossed her arms to return Arnil\u2019s salute, then waved up at me. Arnil gave her the pot of akranil, which she stowed in the flitter\u2019s cold store. He summoned servants to carry the crates inside.\n At the banquet, Katherine looked around with keen interest, noting every detail of the hedonistic abandon with her xenologist\u2019s gaze. Her eyes widened in surprise when the musician struck up a tune on his crude guitar. And Ranis-tra-Laru\u2019s new beverage made her splutter with its stronger kick.\n She looked at me grinning down from the ceiling. \u201cLucian! Is this your doing?\u201d\n \u201cSure is,\u201d I said. \u201cI thought they could use some help. The Ardissans aren\u2019t intrinsically primitive\u2014they\u2019re just held back by the dead hand of the elders. On Earth, we progressed by discarding the outmoded ideas of the past. We couldn\u2019t have done that if we\u2019d been ruled by our ancestors\u2019 ghosts. Would we have abolished slavery if our slave-owning grandfathers still reigned? Would women have gained the vote under the patriarchs? Would science have ever advanced if the earliest, most prehistoric ideas were enforced from above?\u201d\n Katherine said, \u201cI usually disapprove of interfering with the natives\u2014and so does the ethics review board. But I guess it\u2019s impossible to bring humans into the afterlife and expect zero interaction. It\u2019s such a big deal that it must have an impact.\u201d She sounded as though she was rehearsing excuses to tell the editors of Xenology Review.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is so huge, they can\u2019t possibly not publish it. You just need to record what happens, for science.\u201d\n \u201cYes. It\u2019s interesting that the Ardissans here in Mallarn will take direction from you, even though they\u2019ve rebelled against the elders.\u201d\n \u201cIf they want an education,\u201d I said, \u201chow can we refuse? We can\u2019t deny them knowledge. It\u2019s more ethical to teach them than not.\u201d\n As we talked, Ulbim entered the banquet hall and stormed toward Katherine. \u201cIs this your doing?\u201d he demanded, pointing at me.\n \u201cI permitted Lucian to ascend,\u201d she said, using the ritual formulation. \u201cWhat else did you think I wanted the akranil for?\u201d\n \u201cI thought you were a fool, because surely humans could never ascend. Yet with some foul sorcery, you\u2019ve tainted the higher realm.\u201d\n I protested, but Ulbim ignored me.\n \u201cNo more witchcraft,\u201d he said. \u201cThis stops right here!\u201d\n Ulbim clutched Katherine\u2019s hair, forcing her head back. Then he grabbed an obsidian knife from the table and slashed deep into her throat, sawing with the glass blade while Katherine flailed against him.\n Reflexively I rushed to intervene, but my incorporeal arm went straight through them both. And already it was far too late. As blood pumped out, Katherine gave a soft, wet, bubbling gasp. When Ulbim let go of her hair, she slumped to the ground.\n Her mouth kept moving, though she had no air or voice to speak with. After a moment I realized what she was trying to say.\n I shot over to interrupt Arnil\u2019s remonstration with Ulbim. \u201cRun to the flitter and get an akran!\u201d\n They both turned to stare at me. Ulbim said, \u201cYou humans violate our sacred afterlife. I forbid it!\u201d\n \u201cI am master here,\u201d said Arnil. \u201cAnd the afterlife is nothing to any of us, as we\u2019ve all renounced it. But the human female brought food in exchange for our unwanted akranil\u2014\u201d\n Ulbim bellowed defiance, then lowered his head and charged. Arnil dipped his own antlers to defend himself. With a great crash, their heads locked together. They both snarled, swiping at each other with their claws.\n I turned to the onlookers, begging them to go and get an akran for Katherine, whose life ebbed redly onto the floor. But everyone crowded round the fighters, waiting to see who won. No one would risk helping me, in case Ulbim triumphed.\n Frustrated to the core of my being, I impotently observed the combat. I could only watch and hope. I wished I had the authority to stop the fight and simply command the outcome. For the first time, I understood why the elders felt the need to control the lives of the living. I knew what was right\u2014how dare Ulbim defy it? He\u2019d stayed in Mallarn when others who resented me had left; clearly he\u2019d been waiting for Katherine to return.\n The aliens fought using retractable claws, and antlers sharpened with flint scrapers. Their grunts and panting breath echoed around the stone hall. Ulbim screeched as Arnil clawed his ear, tearing it into a bloody flap hanging down his cheek. The antlers disengaged, then crashed together again. Arnil\u2019s weight started to tell, and Ulbim slid backward. Ulbim lashed out in a desperate frenzy, catching Arnil\u2019s neck and gouging clumps of blue fur. Arnil roared with rage. He struck back with powerful scything blows that raked Ulbim\u2019s face and chest.\n The end came quickly. Ulbim, having been forced back and back, raised his head to expose his throat, signaling surrender. Arnil paused, and the onlookers cried out. \u201cKill!\u201d \u201cMercy!\u201d \u201cKill!\u201d\n Arnil pointed to the doorway and said, \u201cBegone! I banish you from my hearth, and from the hearths of my family and followers. I banish your descendants to the fourth generation. At dawn, let your shadow never stain my land again.\u201d\n Ulbim scurried away, under a hail of stones and knives thrown by the crowd. Arnil sat down with a thump, and several followers rushed to lick the blood from his wounds.\n \u201cGet an akran!\u201d I cried.\n Wearily, Arnil waved permission. Ranis-tra-Laru hurried to the flitter, where I explained how to open the cold store. She grabbed the pot and carried it back into the hall.\n Katherine lay on the floor, silent and still. Arnil knelt, uttered the benediction permitting ascent, and carefully placed one of the glands within her wound. As he pressed it into her flesh, I saw Katherine flinch in pain. She lived!\n Blood pooled onto stone. Arnil tried to feed her one of the pain-quenching tonics, but she was beyond such help.\n He said, \u201cShe was our honored guest and deserves the proper rites. Build the funeral pyre! We shall remember her with a feast.\u201d Servants hastened to fetch firewood.\n A spectral haze rose from the body, then coalesced into a recognizable shape: a younger, idealized version of Katherine.\n \u201cLucian,\u201d she said, her newfound spirit voice tremulous with the shock of death and ascent.\n \u201cKatherine.\u201d\n We drifted toward each other. As I stretched my arms to embrace her, we melted together with just a faint tingle. In all the days of my death, I had never missed so much the simple pleasure of touch. We communed wordlessly for long timeless moments, mourning her life cut short. I sensed Katherine\u2019s agonies of regret: she\u2019d grown complacent about visiting Mallarn, neglecting self-defense precautions. I castigated myself for not warning her about Ulbim\u2019s resentments.\n I offered as much comfort as I possessed. I projected a vision of the Afterlife Gazetteer as an old-fashioned book, a reassuringly hefty tome of practical advice\u2014albeit with many blank pages to fill. I\u2019d been lax, staying in Mallarn rather than exploring more of the afterlife, but how could I have known that Katherine would die so soon?\n Katherine\u2019s presence evoked my memories of her, and likewise I perceived her own memories of me. Scenes sprang up, newly vivid through the dual perspective. I smiled to see how handsome and strong and loving I appeared\u2014then cringed at the petulance that followed. At the same time I felt Katherine\u2019s jolt as she saw how her behavior had seemed obsessive, how the drive that initially attracted me later repelled me.\n Just recalling that period broke our rapport. And if I\u2019d anticipated some effortless reconciliation that would magically dissolve our differences, I soon realized it wouldn\u2019t happen. Seeing each other\u2019s viewpoint didn\u2019t automatically make our views the same.\n Yet at least we had experienced each other\u2019s perspectives. Now Katherine knew that I\u2019d never intended to exploit her or demean her work; and I better understood how she\u2019d felt when seemingly reduced to a decorative extra in my planet-hopping life. Perhaps this was a step toward bringing us closer.\n I refocused on our surroundings: the Ardissans stripping off Katherine\u2019s clothes, slitting her belly to remove the guts, hacking off limbs, casting them onto the flames, squabbling for the best portions . . .\n \u201cIs this one of the customs you\u2019re so keen to record?\u201d I asked.\n Katherine looked on, rapt, as Arnil and his followers consumed her flesh. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an honor.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way about it,\u201d I said. Although I found the spectacle upsetting, I felt sure that Katherine could provide all sorts of social, ritual, and nutritional justifications for it.\n She sensed my distaste. \u201cBe careful what changes you suggest. That distillation process you\u2019ve given them will probably create alcoholics. It\u2019s not so easy to decide what\u2019s really an advance.\u201d\n \u201cYou could help me\u2014your knowledge of their culture would show us the best ways to make progress.\u201d I imagined the ideas spreading: practical improvements first, then social changes such as gender equality and the end of slavery.\n \u201cIs this something you really care about?\u201d asked Katherine. \u201cOr are you just meddling to pass the time? I\u2019m sure it boosts your ego to be the source of all human wisdom.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an element of that,\u201d I conceded. \u201cBut what else can we do?\u201d\n Katherine paused. \u201cWell . . . do you want to talk?\u201d\n \u201cSure. What about?\u201d\n \u201cEverything,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m dead, I guess I have time to slow down.\u201d\n Orlind returned with news. \u201cThe elders have called a crusade,\u201d he told Arnil. \u201cThey\u2019ve vowed to destroy Mallarn stone by stone. They say that after defying the elders, you now compound your dishonor by allowing humans to ascend.\u201d\n I remembered the deserters who\u2019d left in disgust at my arrival. No doubt they\u2019d carried tales back home. Was I responsible for sparking a war that might destroy Mallarn? I felt guilty, yet also excited. Progress would do little good if confined here. The rest of the planet had to follow, or at least be given the chance. Was the crusade an opportunity?\n Katherine said, \u201cMaybe we should leave, if our presence threatens Mallarn.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Arnil, \u201cyou\u2019re just an excuse. The elders have long hated us, and a crusade was inevitable. If the hour has arrived\u2014so be it.\u201d He waggled his antlers defiantly.\n Our conversations turned to war. The Ardissans were accustomed to conflict and already had a formidable array of tactics. But their weapons were crude. With my limited expertise, I tried to improve their arrows and catapults: not easy with only local materials.\n I\u2019d imagined a \u201cboot camp\u201d scene like in the movies, with myself as the gruff instructor. It didn\u2019t work out like that. Some hedonists refused to devote themselves to training, arguing that by abandoning their pleasures they would be betraying Mallarn\u2019s ethos. And others were reluctant to submit to classic military principles such as the chain of command and fighting as a unit. Battle on Ardissa was a more individualistic affair, with honor the prime criterion.\n Nevertheless, we drilled and tested weapons and prepared as best we could. I almost looked forward to the battle, which would at least be some diversion from my dreary, bodiless existence. Reminiscing with Katherine had been bittersweet, emphasizing how pale and empty the afterlife felt in comparison to the happier times we\u2019d had in life, in love.\n After returning from a reconnaissance mission, Orlind took me to one side and said, \u201cYou do know this is hopeless?\u201d\n \u201cIs it?\u201d I said.\n \u201cTheir warriors outnumber ours. How many rebels live in Mallarn? Barely a dozen dozens, and half of them are too drunk to fight.\u201d\n \u201cBut this is a fortress. The advantage lies with the defense.\u201d\n \u201cYes, but the attackers don\u2019t care whether they survive, because if they die bravely in battle, they ascend to the afterlife in glory. On the other arm, everyone in Mallarn has surrendered their akran. They don\u2019t want to die, because they have nothing afterward. It makes them cowards, and cowards don\u2019t fight well\u2014if at all. You may recently have noticed fewer revelers at the feasts.\u201d\n Indeed, as the crusade drew nearer, the inhabitants of Mallarn had begun slipping away in ones and twos.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily bad,\u201d I said. \u201cAnyone who runs away has to go somewhere. And they\u2019ll take my suggestions with them. Maybe progress will spread, even if Mallarn falls.\u201d\n I tried to make myself believe it, but lately everything felt futile. The approaching army looked set to crush Mallarn. I couldn\u2019t lift a finger to save it, because I had no fingers.\n \u201cHow do you stand it?\u201d I burst out. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dead for years, ostracized by the elders, and yet you still haven\u2019t gone mad.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Orlind said with feeling. He paused, and I recalled the weariness I\u2019d sensed in him. \u201cThere are ways of coping,\u201d he said at last.\n \u201cHow?\u201d I asked, eager to learn not only for myself but also for Katherine and anyone else who might follow me. In my role as trailblazer for humans in the afterlife, I was still searching for a path. Perhaps the search itself was the only way forward.\n Again Orlind hesitated. \u201cI\u2019d have to show you.\u201d\n After what happened last time, I understood his reluctance. Yet now I\u2019d been longer dead, and had spent far more time with the Ardissans. My previous revulsion wouldn\u2019t recur. \u201cShow me,\u201d I demanded.\n \u201cAre you sure you wish to end all the disquiet of this realm?\u201d asked Orlind, using the declension of a ritual question.\n \u201cDefinitely.\u201d I moved closer to him and opened up, ready to receive his thoughts.\n \u201cBegone!\u201d\u2014\u201cSlave vermin\u201d\u2014\u201cGet away from decent folk\u201d\u2014\u201cDishonor and blasphemy\u201d\u2014\u201cBanished forever.\u201d A torrent of loneliness and rejection gushed into me. I reeled under the onslaught. Was this a coping technique? Surely not.\n I tried to break free, but Orlind held me fast. Again the poisonous emotions flooded in, and he followed them with painful memories of whippings and stonings.\n \u201cHelp!\u201d I screamed into the ether. \u201cKatherine!\u201d\n I struggled to prevent Orlind from overwhelming me. As he attacked again, I let my sense of betrayal pour out. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n My howl burned him, but he fought back. As he battered me with yet more isolation and despair, I felt a tinge of guilt among his anguish. He hadn\u2019t wanted to turn against me, but he\u2019d been promised an end to his ostracism. If he could purge the evil human presence from the afterlife, the elders would finally welcome him. They\u2019d give him the antlers of a warrior hero.\n I tried to resist Orlind\u2019s attack, retaliating with memories of the hospice, of my long slow slide into death. But I knew little of battle in the spirit world, and he had too much horror to scour me with. I could barely hold him off.\n Yet the onslaught stilled. Through our entangled minds, I felt Orlind shudder as Katherine flamed down like a starship incinerating natives with its landing jets. She imposed her own imagery on the conflict, cutting him with lasers and crushing him with skyscrapers. He retaliated with spears, which she vaporized with disdainful ease.\n While Orlind battled Katherine, I countered with all the ennui and frustration I\u2019d pent up since my death. He shriveled under the double attack. I sensed Katherine coming closer to me as she ate into him, tearing his spirit apart.\n Orlind\u2019s resistance vanished. Katherine and I found ourselves floating together in the air above Mallarn. Her personality had a different yet familiar flavor. She\u2019d absorbed the remnants of Orlind\u2019s mind.\n My relief and gratitude spilled forth in an outburst of emotion. \u201cThanks for getting to me in time,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you felt so superior.\u201d\n \u201cThat was his feeling, not mine,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s why it worked. He was so dazzled by our technology, I only had to present the conflict in those terms to defeat him.\u201d\n \u201cPoor Orlind,\u201d I said. Yet I wondered whether he might have had this outcome in mind when he attacked. Whether he won or lost, either way his solitude would end. That was all he\u2019d wanted.\n And I found it reassuring to think that ghostly existence didn\u2019t have to last forever. Knowing I had an alternative\u2014however drastic\u2014reduced my fear of the stretching millennia ahead. Unwittingly, Orlind had given me a little comfort.\n Remembering his description of an invincible approaching army, I saw I had to stop deluding myself that I could single-handedly turn Mallarn\u2019s hedonists into a force capable of fighting off the whole planet. This wasn\u2019t a movie: a training montage wouldn\u2019t be enough. I needed something more, and Katherine\u2019s strategy had told me what it was.\n I drifted down to the flitter, which still stood on the plateau where Katherine had parked it before she died. Inside, I found the usual emergency kit, with rations, distress flares, and a blaster. Ranis-tra-Laru had returned the remaining akranil to the cold store.\n Soon we\u2019d need to contact Katherine\u2019s colleagues, before they became so concerned by her silence that they started searching for her. Katherine\u2019s research team would surely be willing to trade for more ghost-glands, now that they were proven to work in humans. What price for life after death? We could ask for anything we wanted.\n Katherine had followed me into the flitter. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhat do you mean, no?\u201d\n \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. You want to use human technology to defend Mallarn. But it\u2019s not our place to take sides in their wars.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re already on one side. We\u2019ve brought this on Mallarn\u2014we have a responsibility to get them out of it.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you think that would be the end? Do you really imagine you can give out guns before a battle, and afterward they\u2019ll meekly hand them back?\u201d\n I could see her point, but there were ways round it. \u201cBlasters don\u2019t have an infinite charge. They\u2019re useless when it runs out.\u201d\n \u201cUntil some black marketeer in Greenfall recharges them. Once you start giving out guns, you can\u2019t stop. Is that the progress you want to bring?\u201d\n \u201cThe elders despise humans and technology. Are you saying they\u2019d suddenly change their tune?\u201d\n \u201cIt only takes one, and the rest are forced to follow.\u201d\n I stormed out of the flitter. \u201cSo we should just sit on our phantom backsides while we watch the armies tear this down?\u201d I said, pointing to Mallarn looming from the snowy plateau in the moonlight. \u201cIf the crusaders win, you can say goodbye to getting any more akranil. No more humans in the afterlife!\u201d\n And I realized that despite everything, despite the tedious hindrances of immortality, I was ready to report back from the lower slopes and say that the ascent was worth attempting. Yes, the afterlife had its trials and tribulations\u2014like life, like anything worthwhile.\n \u201cI suggest we speak to Arnil,\u201d said Katherine. \u201cHe is the leader here, after all.\u201d\n We had to wait till morning for Arnil to wake, then wait till midday before he ate wathrone. The delay reminded me anew that I had no power to act directly, that I could only whisper in Arnil\u2019s ear and hope he liked what I said. I couldn\u2019t afford to antagonize him. If he banned the consumption of wathrone, my influence in Mallarn would vanish.\n \u201cThe first thing we need to know,\u201d said Arnil, \u201cis how many crusaders we face.\u201d\n Katherine said, \u201cThere are two groups, approaching from the south and west.\u201d I wondered how she knew this; then I remembered that she\u2019d swallowed Orlind\u2019s memories. She went on, \u201cExcluding slaves, the warriors are perhaps eighteen dozen.\u201d\n Was that all? On this thinly populated planet, it probably counted as an army. And it comfortably exceeded the number of fighters in Mallarn.\n \u201cWe can show you how to use the flitter,\u201d I said. \u201cThat will help.\u201d\n Katherine shot me a disapproving look, but then said, \u201cIt can be used to evacuate Mallarn. If everyone left, there would be no one for the crusaders to attack.\u201d\n \u201cAnd they would have won without attacking,\u201d said Arnil.\n \u201cEvacuation would be a last resort,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother option is to go out in the flitter and confront the army before it gets here.\u201d\n Arnil\u2019s muzzle twitched eagerly. \u201cWe can destroy them?\u201d\n \u201cWe can frighten them off,\u201d I said.\n If the enemy wasn\u2019t scared of death, attempting to intimidate them with one flitter would be a long shot. Yet I thought it was worth a try.\n It didn\u2019t take long to teach Arnil how to pilot the flitter. Soon we set off, Arnil flying slowly so that Katherine and I could keep up. She directed him southwest, until we saw the armies converging to attack Mallarn. Splotches of blue dotted the plateau, as if flakes had fallen off the sky.\n Elders hovered above the columns, occasionally darting ahead to scout the way. Some were small; others were huge with enormous fractal antlers. Those must be the most ancient, the ones who ruled Ardissa and smothered it in ignorance.\n Arnil set the flitter down at the convergence point, and we waited for the crusade to arrive. He stepped outside to meet the leaders. A group of elders approached, with a retinue of warriors and slaves. I drew back, wary of being attacked again. Consequently I heard little of Arnil\u2019s address to the enemy, though Katherine explained the protocol for such encounters.\n The crusaders reacted to Arnil\u2019s speech with shouts of \u201cNever!\u201d and \u201cHuman scum!\u201d The elders tipped their antlers menacingly toward us, as Katherine and I hovered a prudent distance away from the scene.\n Arnil said a few final words, then returned to the flitter. He rose above the army, and began firing distress flares at them. Red and yellow explosions burst among the warriors. They fell back, scurrying away on all fours.\n But they rallied when they realized that the flares only burned rather than killed. They began throwing missiles\u2014I heard dull clunks as stones and javelins bounced off the flitter\u2014until Arnil flew up higher, out of their range. The horde waved their spears, tauntingly.\n Then Arnil descended again. I saw his furry arm sticking out of the window, clutching something. The crusaders fell like scythed corn as Arnil fired the blaster. He swooped low over the army, reaping a harvest of ghosts.\n \u201cLucian!\u201d\n I jerked around at Katherine\u2019s cry, and saw elders hurtling toward us. Katherine raced away, and I followed. I tried to imagine myself as a flitter, cutting effortlessly through the air. We fled across the sky while the elders pursued.\n Ahead, Katherine\u2019s shape broke up. Blobs of spirit stuff flashed past me and fell behind. As I kept going, not daring to stop, I saw a slender figure still flying onward. What had happened to Katherine? I looked back to see the frontline of elders swoop on the stray fragments, gobbling them up. That delayed them just enough to give us a chance of getting away.\n I made a superhuman effort and caught up with Katherine, or whatever she had become. I shifted direction slightly, and she followed me toward a nearby range of hills.\n We crashed straight into it, then kept going within the rocks. For long minutes we dodged and weaved and trusted to the darkness underground. I saw no pursuers. After a while we stopped, exhausted.\n Huddled in the dark, we waited to see if they would find us again.\n \u201cAre you all right? What happened to you?\u201d I asked.\n Katherine said, \u201cI dropped off Orlind, what was left of him. I figured it might distract them.\u201d\n \u201cLike a lizard shedding its tail,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI\u2019m glad I did it. His mind was too alien to sit comfortably in mine, especially as he had so many more memories. I learned a lot, but I was worried that he might absorb me rather than vice versa.\u201d\n We melted into each other in wordless comfort. I poured out my relief and joy that she\u2019d chosen the human over the alien. Katherine clung to me as though she would never let go again.\n I sensed her annoyance that we\u2019d had to flee before seeing the confrontation\u2019s outcome. \u201cI expect Arnil drove off the crusaders,\u201d I said. \u201cThey can\u2019t stand against human technology.\u201d\n Remembering the sight of Arnil firing down into the helpless mob, I wished the victory had been won by the better argument, not the better weapon. Yet Arnil had only been defending himself and his way of life against enemies who\u2019d vowed to crush him. Perhaps the deaths had averted a far bloodier battle.\n \u201cWhat now?\u201d asked Katherine. \u201cBack to Mallarn?\u201d\n \u201cNo. I\u2019ve given them enough suggestions. The rest is up to them.\u201d\n Katherine laughed. \u201cAre you sure they can manage without you? Maybe you were just another type of elder. Instead of a dead hand holding them back, you were a dead hand pushing them forward.\u201d\n \u201cGive them some credit,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my specific input that mattered, but the idea of progress. Now that they\u2019ve tasted it, I think they\u2019ll want more.\u201d\n But the only way to prove that would be to leave Mallarn alone, and let the hedonists advance\u2014or not\u2014at their own pace. Meanwhile we\u2019d return to Greenfall Station, bringing news of the afterlife to the rest of humanity.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll drop into Mallarn occasionally to trade for akranil, until we can work out how to make them synthetically,\u201d Katherine said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how they\u2019re managing.\u201d\n I longed to know whether I\u2019d inspired genuine progress. At last I understood Katherine\u2019s curiosity, and shared it. But the Ardissans had their own path to walk.\n Katherine and I needed to find the best route for ourselves, and our future companions, as we climbed the endless mountain of eternity."}

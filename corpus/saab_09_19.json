Skip along the informational alleys of realspace, leap the archives inter-generationally. A descending white cascade of snow. #FFFFFF. Pixelated scrub. You\u2019re a miniscule skier. Your motor control is dampened by four low-acuity arrow keys, by the graphics cards and CPU speeds of antiquity. You ski, swerve, ski down the glare of a screen, until a yeti emerges from an offscreen hideout to devour you.\n Doesn\u2019t everyone struggle to beat the impoverished algorithm earthed in a singular fatality? You know now, as they knew then, that death is absolute, though life may be manipulated, stretched between fingers like tree gum, thinner and thinner until translucent. You\u2019d tell this to Nouri if he asked you again: to subvert death is an abomination. You missed your opportunity to say it long ago. You\u2019re here to give yourself a second chance. Maybe give him a second chance.\n In the distance, the habitat is color-saturated, washed in light. You stop a moment to look, breath fogging. The saturation has nothing to do with the late afternoon light and everything to do with the habitat\u2019s shortfall of nanos. You\u2019re trekking east through Florid Park, veering away from the half-mile-wide cusp of bioshacks on the horizon, navigating toward the Park Service outpost you are obliged by permit to check into by sundown.\n Under your feet, small life crunches. You are cold. Your baselayer, nanoblocker, windproofing\u2014none are Florid Park rated. It\u2019s been hard walking since you entered by Lesha Gate, an unbroken afternoon of it. But the trekking is not the challenge. You have walked the parkland trails down to dirt. You\u2019ve traveled the informational frontiers your whole adult life, mapping bonespace into realspace, stone and dirt and fabbing into archival infinities. You\u2019ve got 880 hourcreds of rough terrain hiking to show for it, two royal trailwalking Nods, and if you cared enough about such things you could qualify as a walking guide to galactic-iso standards. You don\u2019t.\n The immortal who meets you at the outpost doesn\u2019t greet you or give a name.\n \u201cAgent, Park Service,\u201d is all she says.\n \u201cSzanna. On the Hectare Lab permit.\u201d You push the permit to her in realspace.\n It\u2019s hard to tell for sure, but she seems to be waiting. She finally nods. She is uninterested in you, but you are very interested in her. You study her face. You note the long-growing ears, sculpted lobes, and aquiline nose indicative of immortality, the lack of folds around the smile packed tight as the patchy snow beneath her polydown-stuffed boots. She approves the permit and sends you maps of Florid Park, all its leafless copses and crops of boulders and snowy open fields. You remember the ancient game, Szanna. The game with the skier and yeti.\n \u201cAnd the assistant you registered?\u201d asks the Agent. In realspace, she pushes you Maschou\u2019s card.\n \u201cShe couldn\u2019t come.\u201d The permit, which you worked a personal contact to obtain, didn\u2019t extend to two. \u201cBut we should go,\u201d you say. \u201cI have three days to fill the whole habitat in.\u201d\n The Agent looks at you dully. You test out a smile.\n \u201cThis map is the main distraction at a Lapis Colloquium in a few nights, according to the client brief,\u201d you elaborate. \u201cHectare Lab builds these playable archives all the time. We find you can\u2019t skimp on detail.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a short walk there,\u201d she says. She hefts a pack and does not offer to supplement your thin outerwear, your scant supplies. But neither does she challenge the rating of your blocker or prophylaxis. For that you\u2019re grateful.\n Szanna, you march behind the Agent and do not look too closely at the birds stark against the trees, at the evidence of nanofuzzing like static between their feathers. You do not want to know how the intelligent selection plays out, which colonized birds will live, and which succumb. Which of them are intended, and which mistakes.\n You squint. In the distance, specks resolve into people moving near the edges of the habitat. And in realspace, you\u2019re unlocking the Agent\u2019s locale packet. It\u2019s sparse, some waypoints, a main track, some habitat zoning. But if it were any less sparse, you wouldn\u2019t be here with the mapping permit you\u2019ve got.\n In bonespace and realspace, you search for Nouri.\n Do you remember this game from the twentieth century? They called it the Game of Life. Drab gray board, yellow tiles. Gray for death and yellow for life. Each round of gameplay would step forward a simulation of natural selection, proliferation, population decline. You imagine each yellow tile unpacking and spreading wings and taking to the treetops; you imagine Nouri a solitary blip in one corner, huddled in on himself.\n And how many rounds does it take to flip Nouri\u2019s tile to gray? The answer is too many rounds. As many as the grid endures.\n Avicenna Park\n There was a game you\u2019d play with Nouri before you were grown. It was called The Immortals, and in the nonsense way of games it had nothing to do with life or death, but also everything to do with both. Once, with bare hands, the Nouri of your childhood scalloped a den inside a hedgebush on the border of Avicenna Park. The park beyond was golden and hazy with airborne sand. The royal desert, you two called it, because it was maintained by the private park service of the ruling family. (Somewhere inside, the foundations of Hectare Lab had just been poured, though that was nothing to you yet.) It was nearly nightfall and you were warm with chasing and falling, and with imagination. In you went, into the heart of the hedge-den, Nouri first, you squeezing in after. The prickly bush left lazy welts along your arms.\n \u201cWe\u2019re the immortals now,\u201d said Nouri in the perfect quiet. He was forty-three days younger than you and you never let him forget it.\n You began to skip through the realspace archives, looking for some suitably regal concerto to fill the silence.\n \u201cIn their hideout, the immortals do not go to realspace,\u201d Nouri chided.\n You snapped back to bonespace. \u201cWhat do they do?\u201d\n \u201cThey make life better,\u201d he said, \u201cfor everyone.\u201d\n Nouri did not explain the practicalities of making life better. You remained there with him for hours, fighting cramp, disappeared from the world. You leaned back on your elbows and stomped your feet when they deadened. The sun began to set outside. The humidity was brimming with the scent of eidergraze sap. Nouri fell asleep against you. You didn\u2019t wake him. Later you were reminded that the desertland of Avicenna Park was freezing at night, cold as an atmosphereless planet, as cold as you are now, aged thirty-nine, and mortal.\n You did not leave bonespace until Nouri woke and led you back, shivering, into purple night.\n \u201cNext time, we\u2019ll go all the way in,\u201d he said, turning to face the Ghosh Gate of Avicenna Park.\n You felt the cold then as a burning. Only your heart kept going through it.\n Florid Park\n You choose the first of the habitat\u2019s structures to map, a bioshack on the outskirts of a domestic zone. With the Agent trailing you like this, the pestilents don\u2019t come near. They are preparing meals, immersion meditating in ones and twos, fabbing clothing, quietly conversing. You squint downcast eyes, dazzled by the light\u2014it\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve experienced. All varietals of nano from the Upgrade onward are programmed to avoid the pestilence\u2014you know this\u2014but what shocks you is how different the world looks unfiltered. It scares you, makes the usual presence, somehow, loom.\n You stop when the bioshack is within arm\u2019s reach. The Agent is unceremonious. \u201cBegin.\u201d\n To start a map from bonespace to realspace is as easy as forming a new thought.\n You informationally lasso the bioshack, taking a rough model of it for your realspace map. Then, walking around it in bonespace, touching it with your hands, examining, you lance it, sampling informational layers, the textures and movable parts, the doors and windows and latches.\n (This, to you, is a kind of freedom, is expansive. Is, perhaps, a variety of immortality.)\n In moments, the outside of the bioshack is mapped in. You\u2019ll do the interior later. You turn to the Agent, gesture toward the next structure, a water generator behind the grilling station where pestilents are gathered, stirring something thickly bubbling. A scent like molasses carries in waves with the breeze.\n A few look up at you. Their hands slow. \u201cThey\u2019re cooking homemade nanoblocker for their eyelids and nostrils,\u201d says the Agent from behind you. Her voice comes from a great, unaffected distance. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to lower the load in their cortical matter, and since their nanos conduit over mucous membranes\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d you interrupt, gently.\n When you see Nouri among the pestilents at the grilling station, you don\u2019t recognize him at first, and you think your dazzled eyes are to blame. You would have sworn you\u2019d know Nouri anywhere, any way. You know his face better than your own, even this changed face of an immortal-gone-wrong, the blanched-brown nanoburn patches up his neck and across his brow. He\u2019s older, but not yet immortal-old, not so old that the elongated ears and nose have given him that vertical countenance.\n You turn away before you know whether he\u2019s seen you too, before his reaction betrays you. But your own face must be enough of a tell, because the Agent snaps, \u201cI will supervise interactions.\u201d\n In realspace, you receive a line clipped from the permit agreement you didn\u2019t bother to read. The Park Service\u2019s data-chained signature is a golden plait in the corner.\n \u201cFor your safety,\u201d the Agent adds. Not for the safety of the pestilents. That ease of abandonment, from one immortal to a lesser other.\n Out by the water generator, the wind slices. You begin to map. Szanna, you\u2019re very cold. To your fingertips the world is gauze and extruded foam. You tamp down the urge to call Nouri\u2019s name, to walk right up and tug him to your chest. Your prophylaxis is experimental, and Nouri must be teeming with pestilence. Still. If not for the Agent, you know what you would do.\n Instead, you visualize a gauze-stuffed throat. Call it silent. And call it your own.\n And then you build him a game.\n You map in the water generator. There\u2019s a condensation pole of four spires, a sectioned moat, a graduated filtering chamber. You map the spires into realspace, and in your own private instance of the map you add colored pennants. To each of the moats you add game pieces in the shapes of the finest lapis cuts: brilliantine, princess, convex, diamantine. To create movements of play, you add a truth-detector sensitive to tone of voice, a series of debate topics, a role of interlocutor and respondent controlled by a pair of badges. You declare the rules of the game: it\u2019s a race to lower the pennants down the pole. The debate topics, you store in the filtering chamber, embossed on the bellies of golden fish: About immortality. About the flesh. About desire. About secrets.\n Then you embed the prize: the package of code you and Maschou have been developing at Hectare Lab for the past five years. You tie it in a bow.\n This is the game you design for Nouri, Szanna. You finish the official map of the water generator, closing it with your maker\u2019s plait. And there, over your shoulder, is the Agent, pacing. Wherever she goes, the pestilents leave a wide berth.\n If you could get Nouri to handshake with you, exchange cards, you could give him the game. And if you two could find somewhere to immersion meditate without arousing attention, you could play a round. And if he wanted to win, you could help him win.\n When you look for Nouri this time, you\u2019re subtle, the movement of your gaze a movement of clouds. And when you spot him again, he\u2019s almost gone: heading out past the edges of the habitat in a group, in the grips of nanofever, driven by an imperative he can\u2019t resist.\n Later, as the day dims, the Agent shows you to your bioshack. You stab praying hands into the nanofat membrane, let yourself in. Two foam pallets, a wet corner, a bidet, and a clothes cycler. It smells of new fabbing layered over the burned milk of the nanofat.\n You lie down without undressing. You drift off chanting: about immortality, about the flesh.\n Florid Park\n Do you remember this game from the twentieth century? Cast back. A game board is scattered with hidden mines. Concealed in the game board are clues. Heed the clues and you\u2019ll know how many mines to look for. Sometimes, the game unravels for you, satisfying as a snarl of rope. Sometimes, your very first touch is doomed, a fate you are helpless to prevent.\n Szanna, on the second day, you ask the Agent for a pestilent. You\u2019re heading for the habitat\u2019s hospital, a silo towering over the bioshacks. It\u2019s the biggest structure you\u2019ll need to map. \u201cCan one of them help with the ladder?\u201d\n \u201cIf you like. You\u2019re waivered; you\u2019ve declared blocker and prophylaxis,\u201d the Agent says. There\u2019s no danger to her, after all, only to you. Florid Park is her home. Her nanos will of necessity be an impervious blend, made by Royal Warrant and restricted by Decree.\n You scan intently for Nouri\u2014the Agent sees this, thinks you\u2019re scowling at the desolation.\n \u201cThe Park Service thinks in centuries, not years,\u201d she says. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s volunteered information. \u201cFlorid Park will spawn fantastic ecosystems in the future. The mix of evergreen life and nano. The temperature range is perfect for spawns of modded bios. Low precipitation too.\u201d\n You run your hand over the door fob of the hospital. It\u2019s defunct, undiscoverable in realspace. A manual lock has been installed below it.\n The Agent says, \u201cThe pestilents are happy here. They could live here forever.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean, you\u2019ll make sure they live here forever,\u201d you say before you think.\n The Agent\u2019s eyes, when you meet them, are intrigued for the first time. \u201cWhat is it you think we\u2019re doing here?\u201d she asks wryly. \u201cThe pestilence is as resourceful as it is corrupt. You hate immortals. Do you envy us? Resent the sureness of your death? Feel noble to have a beginning and an end? Or are you sorely tempted to live forever, but terrified of what you might become?\n \u201cWhatever it is you think\u2014Florid Park\u2019s nanome is a barrier. You might not trust the mechanisms that are protecting you. But the fact remains\u2014they are protecting you.\u201d\n You point across the habitat. In the industrial zone, Nouri is scooping and sorting something into three different sacks. \u201cI want him. The tall one.\u201d\n Avicenna Park\n And here is a game which is not a game. You are young, Szanna, though older than the evening you spent nestled in the hedgebush. You\u2019re old enough that the game in the hedgebush makes you blush, the thought of you tucked in, your joints and corners and angles, and Nouri right there.\n This game is: you and Nouri and Maschou walk together from Partridge Perch to the small gazebo in the Pasture of Buffalo. The game which is not a game is that you do everything to avoid Nouri\u2019s eyes, though sometimes his eyes seek yours, all of him craning over, his new adolescent frame long and undernourished and potent with hungry bones. Nanos have never yet touched his marrow.\n \u201cSo would you?\u201d he asks you both, looking from your face to Maschou\u2019s. \u201cLive forever?\u201d\n Immortality has only newly cut away from the banquet halls and ballrooms of the royals. The immortals are, for the first time, on the streets. Szanna, you\u2019ve known from very first awareness that it will never be for you to cheat death. But you do not say this.\n \u201cIf I was sure it was safe? If I was sure I\u2019d still be me,\u201d says Maschou, after solemn consideration.\n \u201cWell?\u201d says Nouri, turning to you. He does something he\u2019s never done before. He takes your hand. Your lungs quiver and the walking cadence of your breath stalls. You look at neither of your friends. Ahead of you, the small gazebo in the Pasture of Buffalo appears on the horizon, its decorative curlicue spearing the sky\u2019s flank. Also on the horizon: a whole, full life yet to be settled on. This particular game, Szanna? Holds a thrill you\u2019ve never felt.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d you stall. Your bluster seems an evident fake in your ears. \u201cWould you?\u201d you fire back.\n \u201cHave this forever?\u201d says Nouri, spreading his arms. \u201cI\u2019d do anything.\u201d And he cranes over, and smiles directly into your eyes.\n Florid Park\n You and Nouri handshake privately. In realspace, he blooms, immediately there. A negative space you\u2019d scarred over since the expiry of his last handshake returns to presence.\n In bonespace, he is aloof, even a little rude, ruder to you than to the Agent. He sneers at you, airgaps your bodies, which of course he\u2019s obliged to do\u2014the public health Decree. But he exaggerates, seems all too willing to keep his distance.\n When you request it, he allows you to form a sensory chain, awkwardly scales the sandy rungs up to the hospital\u2019s silo roof, runs his hands over and under panels and ports and receivers.\n You think maybe it\u2019s that he has forgotten. But then in realspace he tunnels to you, and blurts, \u201cSzanna. It\u2019s too late.\u201d\n You don\u2019t ask what late means to an immortal.\n By way of apology, you send him the game you made\u2014with the water generator, the pennants, the fish.\n \u201cMaschou tried to be here too,\u201d you say in realspace.\n Nouri replies with that old deep-bass pulse, his version of an affirmative.\n \u201cThis game looks fun,\u201d he remarks after a while. \u201cWe should find a moment to play.\u201d\n In bonespace, he\u2019s squatting on the roof of the hospital, gently lifting insulation foam, lancing down to the rusty layer below. You chain his informational feed into the realspace map, hungrily painting in the structure. It\u2019s satisfying the way a long-awaited meal is satisfying.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll certainly play it,\u201d you say. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a bit of privacy to immerse.\u201d\n His affirmative pulse comes with a lilt at the end. In realspace, this is how Nouri grins.\n \u201cI\u2019ve missed Maschou,\u201d Nouri says. \u201cBut I think I\u2019ve missed you more.\u201d\n Avicenna Park\n There is a corner of the royal desert that feels to you like home.\n The path is badly marked, the trees pristine and unmodified. The wind makes a racket of the branches and throws flights of dust into your eyes until they stream beige tears.\n In this corner of Avicenna Park is Hectare Lab, commissioned twenty years ago under the Royal Family\u2019s Realspace Charter, decommissioned ten in favor of centralized governance. Your work permit, long expired, unlocks the gate for you every morning. A miracle.\n You meet Maschou there. Every day should be the day she does not come. To be children together, to happen to be selected under the same Decree, was one thing. But for her to come daily to a decommissioned Hectare Lab, to do what you ask, uncompensated and unenlightened? She helps with both the covert real work and the public front for it\u2014the realspace maps that you sell to private sponsors, affording you both operational legitimacy and income. You expect Maschou to steal the pestilence cultures, the prophylaxis cocktails, the permits, or the thermal cycler, any one of which she could sell on the gray market for enough to live on for a year. Szanna, you would not fault her if she did. She is owed a lot. But she comes. And does not leave, and does not take. For five years, she has come.\n It took you half of those years to tell Maschou why you were doing this. What Nouri\u2019d done. Before that, what did she think? And when she understood, what did she think? You see the way she looks at you. And you think you know why she stays.\n Florid Park\n Hours later, in the middle of the night, when the Agent\u2019s breathing beside you has slowed, you stretch your nanoblocker over your body, arrange the windproofing on top, stand, and urge yourself back to life. Szanna, you are so much more expectant than afraid. You emerge into freezing cold, into pitch dark. You navigate in realspace, using the rough habitat map. In bonespace, you are shivering so hard you\u2019re amazed to be moving forward. You crouch-run the length of your domestic zone. When you find Nouri\u2019s bioshack, you kneel, widen a space in the nanofat. Crawl inside, violently shaking, reckless and punch-drunk with proximity.\n In a belated heartbeat, Szanna, it will occur to you that the Nouri you\u2019ve found here is not the Nouri you once knew. This Nouri stirs on his pallet. You pull your blocker as far up your neck as it will go, take a step forward. Not for the first time, you doubt the prophylaxis that Maschou fabbed for you. Neither of you knew exactly what versions of the pestilence might be in Nouri\u2019s colony. Your cocktail is educated guesswork.\n \u201cCan I touch you?\u201d you ask from beyond the airgap. \u201cI\u2019m protected.\u201d You sound so dangerously sure.\n Finally, his muffled voice in bonespace. Beloved. \u201cSzanna\u2014\u201d\n He sinks into quiet and you are drawn by the silence, drawn bodily forward. You\u2019re on your knees when you see the feathered mess he\u2019s holding against his flared nostrils. He is streaked with avian blood and nanofuzz.\n \u201cA pre-Upgrade varietal?\u201d you ask. \u201cHow\u2019d it get into Florid Park?\u201d\n In realspace, his voice is steady. \u201cPark Service calls this a closed system. The pestilence encircled by impervious varietals for miles.\u201d He shifts minutely, creating an overhang of space on his pallet. \u201cBut no open-air quarantine could ever be fully tight. Not one enforced by aversion.\u201d\n Nouri scoots a little further, Szanna, \u2019til the space on the pallet is the width of your body. He does not disturb the placement of the dead bird he\u2019s siphoning to diversify his colony. You know that inside of him, something is happening: first, the pestilence reprogramming the new arrivals until they too are the pestilence. Then, that formality dealt with, there\u2019ll be round after round of selection. For more efficient algorithms, new imperatives, a faster colonization drive.\n The goal of his colony is to keep Nouri alive forever. A side effect of this goal\u2014swiftly traced to a bug in the orchestration routine of pre-Upgrade varietals, corrected in new varietals during the Upgrade, but never demonstrated to be patchable in an established colony\u2014is making him sick.\n \u201cRemember the game I sent you?\u201d you ask, and mark it for him in realspace. \u201cCan you immerse here? With me? I need to show you something.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think I can right now,\u201d says Nouri. \u201cI\u2019m too activated.\u201d You note that he chooses that word, activated, over the other, aroused.\n He sets the dead bird to one side and holds out a bloodied hand.\n Maybe it\u2019s his lucidity, the fact that he seems there, seems himself. Whatever it is: you let yourself fall. Your knees hit padded nanofat. You fill the space he\u2019s left open for you, let his heat smother the trembling, and you pray that Maschou\u2019s prophylaxis will hold, that the nanoblocker will be better than useless. Because otherwise you are defenseless, Szanna. Are, as you\u2019ve always been.\n Avicenna Park\n Summer is your season. It turns Avicenna Park rouge and planetary. You return from six months of tutoring at the Royal Science Boarders\u2019 House, a whirlwind of cramming and barely edible canteen meals and experiments failed and retried. This half-year, you\u2019ve taken your first ever round of prophylaxis against the pestilence\u2014and by broad spectrum, against immortality too. Adolescence and prophylaxis are all mixed up in your bones. Nanos are a fact of life now, and so is the mutability of death. Immortality slowly permeates your list of acquaintances, then friends, then distant relatives, dribbling down from the wildly wealthy to the lavishly well-to-do. So far, their gambles are paying off. You know of nobody with the pestilence, but lots of somebodies who won\u2019t ever die.\n You\u2019re so tired your first night back from boarders\u2019 that you elect to eat dinner pacing the long carpet in the dining room to keep from nodding off. You split gravied dumplings with a tine, plate balanced on your forearm, while your mother and sister catch you up on their news.\n After updates on the weather, the gardening, and any local interest rumor your mother has found credible enough to share, this\u2014\u201cNouri came by this morning.\u201d\n Wakefulness blossoms, brain stem up. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me in a while,\u201d you say tentatively.\n \u201cHe said that if you have time tomorrow, you ought to meet him out at Ghosh Gate. He said his day is free.\u201d\n Your ribs tighten like a belt, Szanna. His day is free spirals into a hundred lives that Nouri lives, here, where you both grew up, on the border of Avicenna Park. You know he refused his placement at boarders\u2019 house, and also that he has been living with his mother and her younger children, his mother who stuns the neighborhood with her extravagances, her stone-sequined coats and deliveries of handcrafted furniture and her bloodline stake in at least one of Avicenna Park\u2019s lapis mines.\n Nouri, the eldest, the forgotten, but forty-three days younger than you, green plum of your heart. (He doesn\u2019t know that. Can\u2019t ever know that.) You meet him in the dripping croaking heat of dusk. He gives you a generous hug that tells how he hasn\u2019t been worrying about this moment all day. The idea of you through his eyes gives you uneasy double vision.\n You two enter Avicenna Park through Ghosh Gate. Nouri looks like he\u2019s been sweating in the weather, something thick about his cheeks, his rise of color a desert sunset. His lips are wide and behind them his teeth sparkle. He\u2019s grown up. The effect is intoxicating.\n \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you,\u201d he says in bonespace. \u201cHow has your year been?\u201d\n You tell him. About the time you ate an entire celebration cake on a dare and were so severely ill they had to nanoflush your guts in the infirmary. About the group of girls who were unkind because no one in your bloodline had ever received a Nod from the royal family (at this, Nouri rolls his eyes), about the boy you thought you secretly loved (Nouri, attentive, what happened?) but who turned out to be an emotional celibate on exchange from the Royal Priesthood, about the endless rounds of prophylaxis\u2014the transient nanococktails teaching your bones and blood something of resistance\u2014\n \u201cProphylaxis? You?\u201d says Nouri, stopping.\n Around you, Avicenna Park is this peach-skin landscape. You\u2019d forgotten the citrus and alkaline scent of the yellow dust, here. An ibis calls out, shrill and short, from one of the many streams burbling through the rocks.\n \u201cYeah, me. I mean, me and everyone. We had no objectors.\u201d You didn\u2019t think this was controversial. \u201cAnd . . . you?\u201d You spit it out before you have time to be afraid of the answer.\n Nouri laughs, now. \u201cNot me.\u201d He half-steps onto a jutting rock, bounds into a circle of dust, stamping two boot prints, and circles back. There\u2019s always been something springy about how he carries his body. Still true, you note, now that he inhabits the body of a man.\n \u201cHonestly? I went somewhat the opposite way,\u201d he smiles coyly, and he\u2019s walking over, breathing a little hard, and you stop strolling, and he comes over, and you can smell his skin and see the row of fine hairs between his eyebrows. He licks his lips and you stop breathing. You have dreamed this more than once.\n Then he does something you\u2019ve never seen anyone do, only heard about. He furs his tongue against his front teeth, and sticks his tongue out flat as a pounded fillet, and you see them, his colony. Among the pink tendrils of his taste buds, a prismatic wave of metal.\n \u201cNo,\u201d you say. Because you never thought he\u2019d\u2014because the risk. Because the pestilence. The cerebellum deactivation, spinal fluid clots, loss of sense of smell, ocular colonization leading to visual artifacts, the dun pigmentation of the skin presenting with cyclical fevers and a progressive degradation of executive function . . .\n \u201cDo you want to live forever so badly that you\u2019d risk eternity in a body that isn\u2019t yours to control?\u201d you whisper, heartbroken.\n Nouri rakes his hair back. His eyes twinkle. \u201cSmall risk, big reward. And that makes it a good game,\u201d he says.\n Florid Park\n The Agent walks you to the immersion theater\u2014a bio-fabbed structure about four times the size of the domestic shacks. You\u2019ve already mapped the outside; today she keys you in. In about half the seats, pestilents are in gecko pose or vertical repose, immersion meditating. The white noise in the background is barely audible. You think it\u2019s supposed to be the sound of the padded drills in a lapis mine, but it might be wind in the leaves.\n You\u2019ve hidden last night\u2019s realspace archives, obfuscated your conversation with Nouri, the long stretches afterward when neither of you said a thing\u2014to your guilty conscience, just as telling\u2014but when you ask the Agent for Nouri\u2019s help again, she shakes her head no.\n \u201cDo it without help.\u201d\n You work, Szanna, your body replaying more than your realspace archives hold. Never before has bonespace felt this much richer than the world of information.\n You\u2019re thinking of the hours you spent as close to Nouri as the barrier of skin would allow. Szanna, there\u2019s a tumult inside you. You wonder whether your touch was too intimate, the skin-to-skin interface too perfect, too slick, your prophylaxis too weak.\n A note from Maschou snaps you back. \u201cPermit extended.\u201d\n And a moment later, the Agent elaborates, \u201cYour assistant sent her approval through. She arrives this afternoon.\u201d\n You meet the question in her statement head-on, and with complete honesty. \u201cThat\u2019s lucky. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d make it. We have a lot left to do, and not much time.\u201d\n So. Maschou managed to work her personal contacts too. Maschou\u2019s always been resourceful. She could beat an immortal at a game of resourcefulness.\n \u201cYour assistant has asked for a walking guide. I will meet her at an outpost midway,\u201d the Agent says testily.\n She edges between you and the communal table you\u2019re filling into your map, forcing your hands off the polished, fabbed wood. Every peaked bone in her face, every missing blemish, the oil slick of her nanocolony on the wet dipped crease of her lip, is suddenly yours to pore over. You can\u2019t hide your fascination.\n \u201cI don\u2019t trust you, Szanna from Hectare Lab, but I don\u2019t care about you either. Immortality is yours to take or leave, the pestilence yours to risk. My duty is only to protect the parkland.\u201d She hitches her pack, readying to leave. \u201cAs a kindness, I remind you to value your life. These unfortunates\u2014\u201d the Agent gestures at the pestilents meditating or communing in hushed tones \u201c\u2014are not in control of themselves. Any one of them could end your life without meaning to.\u201d\n She heads for the door. Pauses. \u201cDeath must seem a trifling thing to someone like you,\u201d she says, \u201cbut even then. It is a trifling thing with no hope of return.\u201d\n Do you remember this game from the twentieth century? The armored tank will be protected at all costs. A brick wall surrounds it. A bevy of defenders trawl the game board, hunting intruders. You are an intruder. Your objective is to breach these defenses. Your objective is to eliminate every defender, restore normalcy. Your objective is not to be blown apart yourself.\n Bahr Khalyy Openspace\n Maschou and Nouri knew each other first. You piece together a mercantile family relation dating back to before your friends were born\u2014Nouri\u2019s mother trading rock lapis through a network that shipped off-world; Maschou\u2019s family managing allowances for the tradership, specializing not in the operational side of this, but in the shadowy art of influence that generated a reliable stream of Royal Decrees and Nods.\n \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else,\u201d Nouri says, slowing as you approach Ghosh Gate.\n You\u2019re nine years old, just old enough to think of your life as a ribbon on which you are in motion, one with a beginning and an end.\n Last week you\u2019d asked Nouri if you were his best friend, and he said yes, but Maschou a close second. \u201cBut who is Maschou?\u201d you asked.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know her,\u201d he\u2019d sniped, and a foul-smelling flower blossomed inside your rib cage.\n But today, you will know her. Nouri takes you to a dry lake bed called Bahr Khalyy. The kids never choose it over the royal desert, finding the barrenness here boring. But what Nouri shows you is that the openspace is rich in surprise: the eggs of amphibians pearl everything. Gnats cloud the air, iridescent in the beam of his blacklight torch.\n He takes you to a hole in a hedge. \u201cI told her to meet us here. Maschou!\u201d\n Here she comes tumbling out to the sound of snapping twigs: a girl big for her age, a sprig tangled in her fringe, and with a smile so unguarded that when she meets your eye it takes you momentarily aback. She sends her card in realspace; you\u2019ve got a weird reflex to bounce it. But you don\u2019t. You handshake. She sends a pulse of pleasure.\n \u201cHow many hedges have you carved into hideouts anyway?\u201d you ask Nouri, shy from the newness.\n \u201cYou never know when you might need a place to lay low,\u201d Nouri says, pulling you by the hand.\n \u201cAn immortals\u2019 court,\u201d Maschou corrects him. She turns to you. Her smile is bold. \u201cCheck it out inside.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d says Nouri, blocking you with his body. It\u2019s unfair that he\u2019s stronger than you, though you\u2019re the same height. \u201cYou have to swear to keep the secret. Hideouts only work if no one knows about them.\u201d\n \u201cI promise,\u201d you say. Maschou grins. The three of you Pact in realspace.\n Florid Park\n As soon as the Agent is gone, you go looking for Nouri.\n Inside his bioshack, the air is settled. He\u2019s not there. You emerge again into that glaring light. You check the grilling station. Behind the squat silo of the hospital, a group of pestilents chants in dissonant choir. No Nouri. You swing wide of them, head for the perimeter of the habitat, thinking you\u2019ll go around once, scan for him.\n You don\u2019t need to go far. Nouri, there. At the back of a group heading for the tree line with that unmistakable cant of nanofever. You up your pace, catch up, and fall into step with him. Ahead of you, the pestilents walk briskly, favoring their forefeet, that well-documented cerebellum colonization, the overbalanced stride.\n You consider your own feet, blistered and weather-burned despite your meticulously high-fastened boots. You consider the shape of your footfall. You think of Nouri\u2019s body right against your own. Nanocolonization takes an instant or a year: it\u2019s programmatic, not proliferative. You look around you. You fear the pestilents and fear yourself.\n \u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d you say to Nouri, in realspace. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much time.\u201d\n \u201cDo you remember the first day of your life?\u201d replies Nouri in bonespace, answering himself without giving you a chance: \u201cYes. The sun path was twenty-two degrees and four hours; the moons were both waning; the temperature was above average for the day. Rain misted in my hair. My mother was a celestial body.\u201d\n \u201cNouri,\u201d you insist in realspace\u2014you grasp his arm, and in the bravest motion of your life, tug him away from the group, into the dappled shadow of an outlying tree.\n (You had no idea what strength to expect of this different Nouri, immortal-in-nanofever Nouri, but he\u2019s so yielding, Szanna. So very like dough. His bones could be jelly.)\n \u201cDo you remember the second day of your life?\u201d Nouri asks. \u201cYou immediately crawled. You immediately hid. The game began, the hourglass turned.\u201d\n \u201cLook at me,\u201d you say with sudden certainty. Your breath mists, swirls into his. His bottom lip is trembling. Nanoburns crawl in elaborate fractals into his hairline. \u201cTake me there. Take me to the hideout.\u201d`\n Caesura\n Szanna, do you remember this game you\u2019d play? Every day, you\u2019d swap one ugly thing for a beautiful one. You began in the world of information: every item you touched in realspace, you made better. You pored over every archival game from the twentieth century, enriching wikis. You built emulators to run primitive code, added secret levels, kinder enemies. You overlaid several archival layouts of early lapis mines to create fuller composites, added anecdotal waypoints to maps of off-world caravan routes.\n Some days you looked to bonespace. You were not as miraculous as a colony of nanos, but you could make the world better in your small ways. You collected replicas of playing cards and game pieces. Printed textured maps on archival paper. Knitted gloves for the lapis miners. Every day you planted a seed. Most were informational, but some were organic. You ended up in your thoughts. You would clear out the ones that hurt, and give their scars several days to scab over. You\u2019d come back from your rough terrain hikes reeking of your body, meet Maschou for mixed fry or dumplings in yellow broth. She held her nose, exiled you to the far side of the table. You went and did not protest. A feeling jabbed your mortal heart, a good feeling, metronomic. It said: beat until you can\u2019t.\n And some days, in the distance, beyond these vistas of your life, did you think you spied infinity?\n Florid Park\n Nouri takes you to a copse of trees gnarled with tendrils of fern. Nanofuzz sparkles on every patch of moss, every brush of kir, in every teardrop of tree gum.\n \u201cIs it safe for me here?\u201d you ask in bonespace.\n \u201cSafe? Safe is a fallacy,\u201d says Nouri, trudging ahead of you, breathing loudly, dripping fever sweat. You sense him trying to project sobriety, but everything about him is a giveaway. \u201cNo one is safe anywhere,\u201d he adds. \u201cEven immortality doesn\u2019t mean safety.\u201d\n \u2014In realspace, Maschou opens a tunnel, pings you a locator. She has entered Florid Park by the north gate. You ping a locator back\u2014\n \u201cRemember, a Pact is a Pact,\u201d says Nouri, and waves you toward a fern curtain hanging from the interlocking root system of a trio of kir trees, each tree immense, building-sized. \u201cIn here.\u201d\n The fern crackles with nanofuzz. You cover your eyes and nose, dive through it, bend and crawl, barely breathing.\n And in a moment you emerge, Szanna.\n What has Nouri built?\n An immortals\u2019 court.\n Towering hall, bubbly nanofilms moving like animated stained glass on wounds in the tree trunks. Thrones of moss and rock. Intricate tapestries stitched from the delicate bones of birds. The light here is soft and the air rich with sap. Tiles embedded into the earth under your boots are scales from pine cones and scales of kir, dark brown and light, inlaid in hoof patterns around a central medallion.\n It\u2019s the work of a lifetime, Szanna. The project of a life that has many chapters left, even if it\u2019s a life warped thin and translucent between two fingers.\n You breathe a heavy breath. Your heartbeat is irregular. Gullible, fallible.\n \u201cDo you think this makes life better?\u201d asks Nouri, looking around. Even refracted through his fever, the sincerity of his question bruises your heart.\n \u201cImmerse with me,\u201d you say softly. It\u2019s quiet here, and safe. You open a realspace tunnel, obfuscate your conversation stream, hide the both of you as well as you can.\n In realspace you mark the game again. You flutter the pennants on the condensation poles, rock the gleaming game pieces in their moats. \u201cMaschou and I. We designed this for you. You just answer the questions. If the prize is what you seek? Then the prize is yours.\u201d\n \u201cYou designed a whole game for me?\u201d asks Nouri. \u201cWhy? How long did that take?\u201d\n \u201cHow long did this take?\u201d you counter, evading, spinning around.\n \u201cYears,\u201d he says in bonespace. \u201cYears.\u201d\n He says it so sadly you almost forget how many years he has left.\n Bahr Khalyy Openspace\n The first game Nouri ever showed you from the twentieth century was the paper fortuneteller. He taught you how to make one from the flat papery leaf of the basalt tree growing by the creek in Bahr Khalyy. You were one day older than ten. He was forty-three days younger than you.\n It remained your favorite game into adulthood. Out hiking, to distract yourself from cold or blisters, you ordered laser cuts of stiff silks and vegetable paper and oliosheet, dyed pastel colors. You made hundreds. Spelled enough fortunes to fill a royal almanac. One fortuneteller you encrusted with lapis pebbles Nouri\u2019s mother had gifted you. They shone when the origami flared open. You held your fortuneteller pinched tight, a universe before inflation, and asked it about Nouri, about Maschou, about immortality. About every unlived year of your surprisingly persistent life. You picked numbers, picked colors. Picked death, picked life, picked death, picked life.\n Florid Park\n You open your eyes to Maschou\u2019s face. You think, half-dreaming, that you are at boarders\u2019, that Maschou is here to wake you so you don\u2019t sleep through canteen again. You itch where your skin sticks hot to skin; you itch where pine cone scales have pressed wedges into your hip, into the small of your back. You untangle from an unconscious Nouri and the remnants of the coupled gecko pose you\u2019d both been in, immersion meditating. Your body is sore.\n \u201cSzanna,\u201d says Maschou. She reaches out an arm. You take it. Her grip is sure. Has always been.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have long,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for you both, but they\u2019re looking out toward Lesha Gate. Let\u2019s head east.\u201d\n Maschou pulls you up. Your legs are crowing pins and needles. You do not feel much like yourself. You turn to look at Nouri, twitching, nude, his chest rising heavily. You trace backwards from the last thing you remember, then push forward, analyzing the game you and Nouri just played. Your questions, his answers. About immortality. About the flesh. About desire. About secrets.\n But you\u2019re too startled, your placid mind suddenly stormy with fight or flight. You remember playing, but you can\u2019t remember who won.\n \u201cDid it work?\u201d you ask Maschou.\n Her brow furrows. \u201cGive it some time,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll know eventually. So will he. Then maybe we can just ask him? Ask him plainly if he\u2019s happy.\u201d\n She puts an arm around your shoulder, cloaks your body with Florid-Park-rated windproofing.\n \u201cHe will live, one way or the other,\u201d Maschou says.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d you say. Sensation begins to return to your limbs.\n You cover your eyes and nose as you crawl out between the tree roots.\n When you uncover your face, you look behind. The immortals\u2019 court is an absence. A hollow, a heavy appearance. The calm sway of the disturbed fern, the gyring tinsel of its nanofuzz, is the only sign that some misguided someone\u2014here, and everywhere\u2014has been trying and failing to make life better.\n You pick your way toward the east gate of Florid Park, Szanna, with Maschou at your side.

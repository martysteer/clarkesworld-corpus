Novak\u2019s driving isn\u2019t helping; the rover is jumping over the rough terrain, giving us all a good shake, especially the three of us sitting in the back. Ray and I are strapped in, but London is sprawled out, defying regulations, her helmet at her side, her breathing calm, as if she was born to live here, born to do this, never mind the terrain, the sky, the air.\nWe\u2019re on our way out of the Valles Marineris main base, which means our own work stabilizing the central tubes will have to wait. But we go where we\u2019re needed. It\u2019s the base in Melas Chasma this time\u2014the drilling team that works the Melas tunnel think there\u2019s an ice plug in their way and they don\u2019t have the expertise to drain it safely. If they\u2019re not careful, the equipment might melt the ice and flood the tunnel or, worse, cause it to collapse, delaying the colony plans for months. That\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re for. Delicate work, the kind of work you need a good, level head on your shoulders to do well.\nAnother bump sends a jolt of pain down my arm, slicing me from shoulder to wrist. \u201cHey, Novak, take it easy!\u201d I bark. London looks at me and laughs, her teeth the yellow of Martian sky. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Mackintosh?\u201d she asks. \u201cMars too much for ya? Need me to show you how to man up?\u201d\nYulev reaches over from the co-driver\u2019s seat and pokes Novak in the ribs. \u201cHe\u2019s right, man,\u201d he says, tender even in his reproach, his accent rolling over his consonants like a pebble drifting downstream. \u201cThe terrain is bumpy, but it\u2019s not that bumpy.\u201d None of that has any effect on Novak, who simply grunts and keeps steering the rover ahead like a pirate ship on rough seas.\nRay gives me one of their looks, the ones that make me think they\u2019ve known me for years when I\u2019ve only been here a few months. I can see their eyes behind the raised visor of their helmet, dark and full of concern. \u201cHang in there,\u201d they say. \u201cIt\u2019ll ease up as soon as we get to the forest.\u201d They point out the window, and I can almost make out its wind turbines in the distance, silhouetted against the butterscotch sky, a white artificial forest, its trees fruiting with blades.\nI lean as close to the window as my helmet will allow. The sun is high, small, the land vast. I take it all in: the sinuous ridges, the ghosts of seas, the barren rock, the red, red dust. I let it steal my breath away for a moment. Is this what you wanted, brother? Would it have made you happy if you could see this?\nRay places their hand on my knee. The skintight suit numbs me to their touch, but I can still feel it somewhere far, far away. \u201cWhat are you thinking of, Mac?\u201d Ray asks.\nWhat am I thinking of?\nI\u2019m thinking of the dry land that stretches out for miles and miles in front of me. I\u2019m thinking of the rain, back home, ever falling, inescapable. I\u2019m thinking of a body, left out on Mars\u2019 surface, alone, taking forever to decompose.\nI say none of that.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d I say instead. \u201cEnjoying the view. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nOur team hasn\u2019t been together that long, but we\u2019ve already figured out our flow, a procedure that works for off-base call-outs, is efficient, and avoids any stepped-on toes. Ray, by far the most experienced one, an orphan raised by the State to lead teams just like this one, oversees the work and handles the extraction process from the surface. Novak helps them install the pipes, hauls around equipment, and drives the rover. London is in charge of the pump. Yulev and I work down in the tubes, manning the drill that will liquefy the ice, making and sealing the boreholes, installing the reservoir for the outflow to be collected. We\u2019re a well-oiled machine.\nDown in the holes, Mars almost slips my mind. I imagine myself back on Earth in a hole much like this one, Robin working next to me, not talking, just being together, two brothers in the same underground womb, looking out for each other. The rock and the mud close in around me and I let go of everything, forget all about the surface. The hole is all there is. The Earth rumbles under my feet, saying, watch out all you want. You\u2019re only guests here.\nYulev pulls my attention back to this hole, right now, his voice loud in my helmet comms. He\u2019s talking about his kids again while sealing the hole for the outflow to be pumped through. He goes on and on about how he\u2019s here just for a couple of years so he can make a good haul for his family back on Earth. I almost think he\u2019s going to drop the sealant and whip out a couple of mugshots of his brats to show me.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever think about having kids, Mackintosh?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cMe? No,\u201d I say. \u201cI got myself snipped as soon as I could.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, man, why would you do that?\u201d He gives me such a look of shock that now I\u2019m really worried he\u2019ll drop the equipment or do some sudden movement that will end with both of us engulfed in the icy embrace of a Martian flood.\nI shrug. My shoulder reminds me this was a foolish thing to do. \u201cEvery girlfriend I told seemed pretty happy about it, and the rest didn\u2019t care either way.\u201d I glance at him. \u201cBesides, would you really want to see my ugly mug on a kid?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, man, children are joy,\u201d he says, his voice full of a dreamy ache that rubs on me like gravel. \u201cNo matter what shit\u2019s going on over here, I know they\u2019re out there, I know they\u2019re safe, and my heart is full.\u201d\nBack at Mariner base, we pass through the dust shower as quickly as we can, and then everyone rushes to their comms suites to check for messages from Earth. Yulev can barely hold it together every time his girls kiss the screen goodnight. We all love him for it\u2014even as we pretend not to notice when he sobs into his pillow for a few minutes before going to sleep. London gets messages from her elderly mother once or twice a week. Even Novak the Brute has a family that cares enough to get in touch now and then.\nRay and I don\u2019t bother checking. We go straight to our bunks in the dorm.\nI try to get out of my suit and wince as pain slices my shoulder joint like a red-hot knife going through butter. \u201cGod dammit. God bloody dammit.\u201d\n\u201cHere, let me help you with that,\u201d Ray says. They come up to me and stand behind me. Their breath is hot on my neck as they gently peel the suit off me, its alloys maintaining the memory of my shape like a ghost, the afterthought of a body crumpling to the floor.\n\u201cYou need to get that shoulder of yours checked,\u201d Ray says. \u201cSee about fixing it, or I\u2019ll be in trouble.\u201d They look me in the eyes. \u201cHow did you get that injury anyway? If it happened here, I need to know about it.\u201d They try to sound professional, but something else, something caring seeps through. Perhaps that\u2019s also part of their training. Be sensitive to discomfort, anticipate problems, save your team\u2019s life. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m responsible for stuff like that.\u201d\nI point at the wall by their bed. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t have any photos up there?\u201d I ask. You\u2019re such a poor conversationalist, brother, I almost hear Robin\u2019s voice mock me. Can\u2019t even get deflection right. \u201cI mean, I know about your parents, but siblings? Friends? Someone special?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t either,\u201d Ray says. I\u2019m now entirely released from my suit, but Ray is still standing behind me close, too close, not close enough. I can feel the heat coming off their body, their face, their hands.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d I reply.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me either,\u201d they say. Their voice is soft and low, as if talking to a wounded animal. \u201cAbout your shoulder.\u201d\nI shake my head and say: \u201cNah, don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s an old injury. From a coal mine back home. Beam fell on it.\u201d I rub the joint, laugh. \u201cMust be the weather\u2019s changing. Might rain.\u201d\nThis is what I don\u2019t say: Someone I owed a lot of money to twisted my arm behind my back and held it there while his buddies beat my brother to death in the middle of the street, right outside our house. It was raining that day, like every day. And my brother looked at me as they were killing him, not accusing, but as if to say It\u2019s okay, brother. No sweat. I\u2019m going willingly, brother, don\u2019t cry.\nRay laughs, the sound edged with nerves. \u201cDo you miss it, Earth? Do you ever think it was a mistake to come here?\u201d\nI turn around to look at them, my bare torso almost touching theirs. \u201cIs this genuine concern?\u201d I snap. \u201cOr are you running another one of those psych evaluations the bosses have you do?\u201d\n\u201cMac . . . \u201d they start, but I cut them off.\nToo close.\n\u201cWhat is it you want to know exactly? All these little questions all these months, all casual like, do you think I don\u2019t notice? This is the story: I didn\u2019t have much going for me on Earth, saw the posters one night, might have been wasted, I don\u2019t recall, you know the ones, MARS NEEDS YOU, finger pointing right at your chest and so forth. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Spoke to the heart and the pocket. What more is there to ask for, right? Signed up.\u201d Ran from the rain. Tried to live out Robin\u2019s dream of Mars. \u201cHere I am. That\u2019s all there is to it. Nothing to go back to.\u201d\n\u201cMac, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean . . . \u201d Ray starts again, but I raise my hand and back away from them, their skin, their concern.\nI\u2019m not here for this. I don\u2019t get to have this.\nI pull on a Tee and some shorts and run away, through the dorms, to the lounge, to the exit shaft, my skin crawling, my eyes stinging. I stand next to the surface monitor. The sun is coming down, has almost set, yellow on yellow, haloed with blue, not a cloud in sight. Is this what you dreamed of, brother? The only place it never rains.\nAnd yet. All I can see. All I can think.\nI try to apologize the next morning as we\u2019re heading for the tunnels, but Ray smiles and tells me not to worry about it.\nWe\u2019re working on the main base today, taking care of stretches with too many structural problems for the boring machines to deal with, so we head straight to our tubes. One day, all the tunnels, the Mariner base, the Melas, the Eos, will be connected, minimizing surface exposure for everyone in the colony. An underground city burrowed in Mars\u2019 belly, or that\u2019s what they tell us anyway. Some rich guy\u2019s dream, sure, but something worth dreaming of ourselves, something worth working for, a change, a future.\nWe walk from our base to the intersection where we\u2019ll split up, me, Yulev, and London to one tube, Novak and Ray to another. No need to climb to the surface today, maybe not even for a long time, unless they hit another iffy patch at one of the smaller bases. I surprise myself, catch me wishing for some incident that would force the regolith to spit me out, as if my body aches to ascend to the surface, my skin hungering for the rusty sky, the crushing void. That won\u2019t do. Not today. Not ever. I shrug it off.\nRay is walking next to me, our shoulders almost touching, and I have this lump in my throat, a tangle of words hard enough to choke me. I cough. The lump won\u2019t budge. But words come easy to Ray, and I always think I don\u2019t know how they do it, even though every time it\u2019s as simple as asking: \u201cWhat are you thinking, Mac?\u201d\nI flex my arms like an ape. \u201cI\u2019m itching to drill some good holes today,\u201d I try to joke. I sound too much like Novak. More than I intended anyway.\nI don\u2019t say: I think of the sounds of the tunnels back on Earth, the men covered in coal dust, my brother breathing with the voice of the mine. And for some reason that makes me think of the men in my old gym, all razor eyes and clad in steel, pumping hard, sweating toxic, then weeping in the bathrooms when the hot water ever so slightly softened their skin.\nRay shakes their head disapprovingly even as they chuckle at my sorry attempt at bravado. We\u2019re almost at the intersection. They squeeze my shoulder, the one that doesn\u2019t hurt. \u201cHave fun down there today, yeah?\u201d they say. They don\u2019t say: Be careful.\nI nod. \u201cAlways.\u201d We part ways.\nYulev walks ahead, mapping the area we need to secure. I follow with the drill perched on my shoulder and London brings up the rear lugging the support rods and stabilizing material.\nWe set up the rods and Yulev gives me the go-ahead. He flashes me the reading with the recommended drill depth and I start drilling carefully into the sidewalls, shallow borehole after shallow borehole, making a sieve for the stabilizing material to be injected into the arch of the tunnel. My shoulder stabs me with short, regular bursts of pain, but I don\u2019t care. I let myself be lost in that rhythm, the ebb and flow of hurt. Savor it.\nThen I notice the liquid running down my visor, clear as raindrops. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mutter.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Yulev asks, his voice far away.\nI disengage one hand from the drill to wipe the liquid away, and then I see that there is water coming down all over us, Yulev and London both drenched in rain, water pooling by our feet, dousing our machines, our suits. It\u2019s raining in the tunnel. It\u2019s fucking raining in the tunnel.\n\u201cAre you seeing this?\u201d I ask Yulev, my voice frantic and a little shrill, but he seems confused, like he doesn\u2019t understand, like he can\u2019t see or doesn\u2019t care about this freaky, impossible rain.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, man?\u201d he asks back, suddenly alarmed. He flashes another reading at me, and I can\u2019t even see it through my rain-streaked visor but I know I\u2019ve drilled past the safety depth. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Yulev asks again. His voice is tinted with panic.\n\u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, stop!\u201d London shouts.\nCold sweat breaks all over my body as I look up to face the drill that\u2019s still going. I feel the stone give, the crack expand.\nI step away. I should have stopped sooner. Should have felt the fault in the stone. Should have warned them. I yell at them to move, but it\u2019s too late. The crack radiates all the way to the other side, blooming over Yulev\u2019s head. The support rods are not enough to contain that kind of damage. The right side of the tunnel collapses. Yulev is there one moment and the next he\u2019s gone, buried under a pile of rock.\nLondon grabs me from behind and pulls me back, clear of the rubble. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d she screams at me. She drops me to the floor and starts pulling at the rubble, fighting to get to Yulev. We can hear him breathing through the comms.\nIt\u2019s still raining when Ray\u2019s voice spills over our comms channel, ordering us to evacuate the tunnel before it comes down on the rest of us. The crack I hit has reached all the way to the surface.\nI have to tear London from the rubble. We fall back. Leave Yulev behind, all alone, his comms silent now. Can\u2019t even hear his breath.\nAs we make our way back, I think of the surface again. I\u2019m standing on top of some peak, a volcano as old as the world, overlooking everything, and above it and above me a great, red, dusty rain that consumes us all.\nThe medics give us a quick but thorough check and discharge us in under thirty minutes. Both London and I are fine. Ray meets us in the lounge to tell us what we already know. Yulev\u2019s gone. They\u2019re sending an extraction team to retrieve his body as we speak.\nI look at my hands, wet with water. I look around me, at the pouring rain. The entire base is drenched. The tables, the chairs, the monitors, Ray. Their hair is wet, raindrops running down their face and they don\u2019t even notice it.\n\u201cAre you okay, Mac?\u201d they ask.\nIt must be their tone that sets London off. \u201cAre you serious, Ray?\u201d she shouts. \u201cThis motherfucker was acting like an idiot and now Yulev is dead and you\u2019re asking him if he\u2019s okay? I sure hope he\u2019s not!\u201d She moves towards me and grabs me by the neckhole of my Tee. \u201cI\u2019ll fucking kill you for this, you incompetent piece of shit,\u201d she breathes on my face.\nNovak takes a few steps forward but doesn\u2019t try to stop her, like he hasn\u2019t quite made up his mind about where he stands on all of this.\n\u201cLondon,\u201d Ray says, their voice calm but firm. They come between us, put a steady hand on London\u2019s back until she releases me. \u201cLeave us, please,\u201d Ray says. \u201cLet me do my job.\u201d\nLondon turns to look at Ray in the eyes. \u201cWill you, though?\u201d She scoffs. \u201cSoft spots notwithstanding?\u201d\n\u201cLondon, please,\u201d is all Ray needs to say.\nAs soon as she and Novak are gone, Ray takes my hand and sits me on the lounger.\nI keep my eyes on the surface monitor, on the rain raging outside, soaking the land, a private thunderstorm just for me, flooding the world, flattening it and me and us and you, red mud indifferent to your hurt, your death, your mistakes.\n\u201cWhat happened back there, Mac?\u201d Ray asks. \u201cWas there anything wrong with the equipment, or the readings? Did something distract you?\u201d\nI shake my head, hide my face in my palms, the rain coming down, relentless, unstoppable, cold as ever.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me what\u2019s wrong, Mac.\u201d\nDo I tell them? Do I tell them how their face looks streaked with the rains of Mars?\nI look at the monitor again, the indifferent land, the cold mud.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Yulev?\u201d I ask.\nRay hesitates. \u201cWe\u2019ll cremate his body,\u201d they say after a few moments.\nWe should leave him out there, to this land that doesn\u2019t care enough to break your body apart. We shouldn\u2019t send ashes back to his children.\nRay looks at me sharply. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d they ask.\nDid I say that out loud?\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. I ran from the rain. Didn\u2019t escape. Dead boys\u2019 dreams don\u2019t change a thing. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nLondon and Novak come for me the same night, after Yulev\u2019s body is incinerated and packaged for transit on the next shuttle back to Earth. They don\u2019t say a word. I am lying in my bunk, my mattress soaking wet, the rain falling on my closed eyes. No matter what I do, the rain will keep falling. I open my mouth and can feel the rainwater on my lips, my tongue, running down my throat, speaking the cold of Mars. Give up, it says. It\u2019s all right. Nothing matters.\nI keep my eyes shut when Novak grabs me and drags me to the middle of the room. I do not resist. No struggle. Not anymore. Struggle is only for the ones who should go on. London holds me upright, twisting both my arms behind my back, as if she needs to, as if I\u2019m going to put up a fight. I feel my shoulders pop in London\u2019s steel grip as Novak punches me in the face, the chest, the stomach. I can\u2019t help but try to double over, the taste of blood on my tongue, a little burned and a little metallic, like what that astronaut said space smells like once, back when guys like him were a rarity, back when nobody had died on Mars. I open my eyes. London unfolds me again and punches the small of my back, my legs, my ribs. My knees buckle. Novak\u2019s skin glistens with rain. Is Ray here? I\u2019m afraid to look. Are they watching this? Trying to decide whether they should stop it, or whether I deserve it?\nWhen Novak gets tired of beating me, he collapses on the floor, exhausted. London gives me one last kick and leans against the wall, spent, finally allowing me to fall. I find myself on top of Novak, in his arms, an almost-embrace. We are both panting, rainwater pooling around us. My shoulder hurts. Everything hurts. I feel Novak\u2019s chest rising and falling. I think of the indifferent land. So much hurt and none of it matters. Rain is running down Novak\u2019s cheeks. I reach up and touch his face and I want to tell him, don\u2019t cry. Mars doesn\u2019t care, brother, don\u2019t cry.\nI never find out if there are consequences to what London and Novak did to me, but I hope there aren\u2019t. They let me recover in the infirmary. I have my own room. Is that for my protection, I wonder? Did the other teams hear of what I did, what I caused, and are itching to get their hands on me too? Is Ray standing guard outside, trying to stop them from getting to me?\nThe rain here starts and stops, irregular like the beating of my heart, the antiseptic smell of the room overwhelmed by the scent of damp soil. I drift in and out of consciousness. I think of volcanoes, crevasses, seas past, resurrected, canals filled with rain.\nOne time, I see Ray standing over my bed. \u201cWhat are you thinking of, Mac?\u201d I think they say, but maybe they don\u2019t say anything at all.\nI answer anyway.\nI\u2019m thinking of my own father, who was the kind of person that could weep because of a verse he read and which made him feel like a child nobody loved, or like the world was too much, too violent, too loud, too joyous, just all too much.\nAnd I\u2019m thinking of how many places in the universe there still are where nobody has ever died yet and of how fortunate this makes us, but only us, the childless ones holding the ghosts of our children by the hand, safely unborn, and of how unfortunate it makes everyone else, how much untapped opportunity for pain the universe still holds.\nAnd I\u2019m not thinking of Yulev\u2019s children, or of their father\u2019s ashes in a box.\nWhen I open my eyes again, Ray\u2019s gone.\nThe next time I see Ray, I\u2019m discharged and back in my bunk. They knock on the door lightly before walking into the room, even though they don\u2019t have to.\nThey come to tell me I\u2019m off the team, off the mission. London blamed me and my incompetence in her statement and the company didn\u2019t ask any more questions because that meant they\u2019re not liable. And I am to blame, aren\u2019t I?\nI\u2019m to be sent back to Earth. On my own dime, too. Only fair. To do what? Ray can\u2019t answer that, and neither can I, because who knows, and who cares.\nRay sits next to me on the bed and takes my hands in their own. Their skin is cold and wet.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mac,\u201d they say.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I whisper.\nThey lean over and kiss my lips so lightly it really feels like goodbye.\nI cup their face. Rain sliding down their hair, their cheeks, over my fingers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d they say.\nAm I?\nNo, it\u2019s just the way the rain hits me, you see? Like this.\nThe rain stops falling as soon as the shuttle takes off, but I can still feel it on the inside of my skin, pooling, flooding the gaps within.\nNobody talks to me for the entire trip. Ten days, fifteen, twenty-five. Almost there now. I don\u2019t think of Yulev\u2019s ashes on the ship with me. I think of Robin when we were little and the Mars project was just starting. We sat on the roof on a clear night when it wasn\u2019t raining and he looked up at the little red dot in the sky and said he would like to die there one day. I punched him because I thought he said he wanted to die. I was never one for nuance. I imagine Robin on the ship with me, looking back at Earth this time. Time to let go of the red now, brother, he says, get on board with the blue. Then I forget how to speak for a while.\nMy shoulder hurts. The rains don\u2019t come back.\nOn Earth, I realize there\u2019s no need for me to go back to where I came from, so I pick a mining town in the south, dry as a stone, no cloud in the sky, days blue as they come.\nI use what\u2019s left of my small Martian salary to pay for a cheap motel and I make that my home, sparse and unremarkable in every way but its stubbornness to still feel not-lived-in, foreign, no matter how long I live in it. I even have a window I refuse to look out of.\nUsing my credit means the people I owe probably know I\u2019m back. They might look for me, eventually, or they might not, might figure they\u2019ve already taken away enough for me to turn on my heels and flee the planet. Don\u2019t know, don\u2019t really care. Let them come. There\u2019s space for everyone over here on this side of the void.\nI meet my neighbors at the motel. They change every week or so. I remember how to speak again. I tell everyone I was a miner on Mars. That I got my brother killed, and then I got someone\u2019s father killed because I thought I\u2019d escaped even as I couldn\u2019t let go. None of my neighbors are very impressed, but a few ask if I brought any red dust from Mars back with me. \u201cOnly the one in my lungs,\u201d I say, and they laugh. I try to show them, bare my chest, claw at my skin. The company didn\u2019t let me keep my suit, otherwise I\u2019d show them that too. I finally don\u2019t cry, brother, I don\u2019t.\nSooner or later I\u2019ll get a job in the mines here, but not yet. My face is healing nicely and my ribs hurt only when I breathe. The shoulder sometimes turns an angry red. It glows in the dark, like a planet.\nA month passes, two months, three. I buy a battered old laptop and set it up on the single table in the room.\nThere\u2019s a message from Ray on my work account. It\u2019s a minor miracle it hasn\u2019t been deactivated yet.\nRay talks about the mission, about London and Novak, who are still raw from what happened but apparently found love when they joined fists over my bleeding jaw. There are two new members on the team, one lad, one girl, so far so good, but they can\u2019t carry the drill like I did. Ray pauses at that, realizing what they said, no need to say more.\n\u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d they ask instead. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of you.\u201d They pause, a finger tracing a ghost around their lips. There\u2019s nothing else to say, so they close with: \u201cWhat are you thinking of, Mac?\u201d\nThe message ends.\nThe room is dark.\nWhat am I thinking of?\nI look into the camera and hit record.\nI used to have all these thoughts. I used to play the scene in my head, think of what I could have said to change things, what I could have done differently. Used to think of breaking things, fixing things. But all that\u2019s over now. There are some planets you can never flee.\n\u201cMy heart is light, Ray,\u201d I say into the microphone. So everything is simple now. \u201cBe happy.\u201d\nNow I think only of the rains on Mars.\nNatalia Theodoridou is a media & cultural studies scholar, the winner of the 2018 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction, and a Clarion West graduate (class of 2018).

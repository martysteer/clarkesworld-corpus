At twenty-two he published a collection of poetry, and he had his first fiction stories published at twenty-seven. In 2009, the first volume of The Apex Book of World SF came out, edited by Tidhar, as well as dark fantasy novel The Tel Aviv Dossier, cowritten with Nir Yaniv.\nTidhar\u2019s debut solo novel came out in 2010: The Bookman, first in the literary steampunk Bookman series (including 2011\u2019s Camera Obscura and 2012\u2019s The Great Game). In 2011, Osama, a \u201cfilm noir, non-fiction, alternative history, and international thriller,\u201d won him his first major genre award for a novel: a 2012 World Fantasy Award. In 2013 he moved to London, the same year his The Violent Century was published (alternative history cold war espionage and superheroes), followed by 2014\u2019s A Man Lies Dreaming (dark, literary noir thriller with a twist). In 2015 he released the Jews vs Aliens and Jews vs Zombies anthologies coedited with Rebecca Levene, under Jared Shurin\u2019s Jurassic London label (later printed editions by Ben Yehuda press).\nIn 2018, Unholy Land (time travel, noir mystery, and cultural conflict in an alternative East Africa) was released while Scholastic UK published Tidhar\u2019s children\u2019s debut Candy. In Xanadu followed in 2019 and due in 2020 are his upcoming works, By Force Alone, a savage tale of King Arthur and his cronies as gangster-like thugs in early Britain, and his Victorian inspired adventure comic book Adler, with the tagline, \u201cFor Sherlock Holmes, she was always the woman . . . \u201d\nTidhar is one of those rare authors who can play with form and genre, who can draw from recognizable tropes, blend styles, and come out with something completely different, defiant, and yet wonderful. His work has drawn comparisons to Philip K. Dick, Michael Chabon, China Mieville, and Kurt Vonnegut, winning acclaim from an array of notable authors such as Ian McDonald, who said Tidhar is \u201cIn a genre entirely of his own . . . There is no one like him writing in genre today.\u201d With well over a hundred short stories, more than a dozen novellas, and several stand-alone novels out, as well as work in other mediums, anthologies, columns\u2014including The Washington Post\u2014and much more, he seems to be both restless and boundless.\nAn array of award recognitions speak to the broad appreciation of his work\u2014he has appeared on short lists and ballots for the Sturgeon, Geffen, Sidewise, Kitschies, and Dragon awards. He won a 2012 British Fantasy Award for Best Novella for Gorel and the Pot-Bellied God, the Jerwood Fiction Uncovered Prize for A Man Lies Dreaming, a Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award and 2017 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel for Central Station, and most recently, his novella \u201cNew Atlantis\u201d from the May/June issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction was on the 2019 Locus Recommended Reading List.\nHe writes what he wants, he does it well, and in doing so, challenges our understanding of genre and its place in literature.\nYour first publication was a poetry collection in 1998 in Hebrew. Do you still write poetry? Does poetry have any impact on your fiction writing?\nI think failed poets often become novelists instead, which is how I ended up here! For a time, I did publish English-language poetry in small UK poetry magazines (in Carilon, Cadenza, Brittle Star, places like that), but I was never that interested in formal submissions\u2014or didn\u2019t have much success!\u2014and eventually fiction mostly took over. It\u2019s obviously a huge part of anything I do, though. All of By Force Alone is written in a sort of very specific rhythm, like some sort of epic poem. And for a while I snuck poems directly into the books\u2014\u201cWires and Charge\u201d pops up in Osama scribbled on a wall, for instance. I make fun of the whole thing in Unholy Land.\nIn the universe of Central Station, I have a peripheral character called Basho (named after the Japanese poet) who writes sort of not-really-haikus in Bislama, which is my third language. So that\u2019s kind of a fun thing to work in, having this pidgin/creole poetry as part of the history and mythology of that universe.\nI\u2019ve been reading James Legge\u2019s translation of the Chinese Shi Jing most recently. And I just looked it up\u2014the last poem I wrote was in 2015. It\u2019s the sort of impulse that comes and goes. From time to time I think of putting together a collection, or at least a chapbook, but I\u2019ve never progressed enough with it. Maybe in a few more years!\nDo you still write in Hebrew?\nMostly e-mails! Funnily enough, one of the first stories I ever wrote, back when I was seventeen or so, is being published in a Hebrew anthology this year, I think. Which is something that made me very happy! It only took twenty-six years to find a home . . .\nI wrote a fair amount of fiction in Hebrew a few years ago, and then translated some of it into English. I cowrote a novel, a murder mystery set at an Israeli SF convention, which was fun. But then there was not much to do with any of it and the rewards in English were greater, so it sort of petered off.\nMore recently, I had this idea one day that I should write sort of literary slice-of-life fiction in Bislama. I wrote the first one as a challenge. Because Bislama is mostly a spoken language, there isn\u2019t much written fiction done in it. Then I talked to my friend in Vanuatu who happens to edit the local newspaper, and he said he\u2019d give me a monthly column! So for a year I wrote one short story a month in Bislama, and it was published in the Vanuatu Daily Post in a column we ended up calling \u201cStorian Smol,\u201d which translates something like \u201cchat for a bit\u201d. Then I tried to translate some of the stories into English. I had a vague idea of doing a collection and having the Bislama original and the translation side by side. Maybe one day . . .\nThen I went and got this gig cowriting a book column for The Washington Post! So my \u201cbook columnist\u201d CV literally just goes from the Vanuatu Daily Post to that.\nTranslation is kind of interesting. A Man Lies Dreaming came out in Israel a couple of years ago, and it was fascinating. It was so much more shocking in Hebrew for some reason\u2014and also funnier! I found myself both cringing and literally laughing in surprise. It kind of punches you more in Hebrew. But most of my work is not available in Israel and I\u2019m not well-known over there. I\u2019m published more in Japan! Which is ironic, I suppose, but it\u2019s ok.\nWhat was the transition to genre fiction like for you? How did you start writing genre fiction and when did you start taking it seriously, sending work off, and trying to make it as a writer?\nI made a friend who was a \u201cproper\u201d short story writer and I found out about the whole submission process. I never knew you could just send stories out and then someone would read them! And then send you a rejection! I got very excited about the idea. I was looking forward to rejections! Because it just made the whole thing easy, that you write, submit, get rejected\u2014it was kind of low stakes and not personal, which made it easier. Then, ADSED I got an opportunity one summer to just sit in a computer lab at university with nothing much to do, so I started writing. I remember the day I started\u2014sometimes I curse the day I started! I aimed to do 500 words a day, and then pretty much . . . never stopped. I never sold that first story, but I sold the second one, and to this day this is what I\u2019d rather be doing. Just writing short stories and sending them out and getting rejections.\nWinning the Clarke-Bradbury was surreal. It was sponsored by the European Space Agency and I forgot all about it, to be honest. Then at work one day I came back and someone said, \u201cYou had a call from the European Space Agency,\u201d and I was sure it was a prank. But it turned out it really was someone from the ESA! They flew me to Utopiales in France and it was a lot of fun. There\u2019s an e-mail from Arthur C. Clarke somewhere about my story.\nThe thing that kind of changed everything for me was selling a story to Ellen Datlow in 2005, for Sci Fiction. The Sci Fi Channel paid me so much money that I think they suddenly thought, What are we doing! and closed Sci Fiction. And changed their name to Syfy. So mine was the last story they ever published and I always felt really bad about that. Like I personally killed it! And then, ten years later, I got an e-mail from someone at the University of Notre Dame and they asked, could I come talk to the students about my story, since they\u2019re studying it in the course. So that was completely surreal, that something I wrote one summer years ago as a student is now . . . curriculum! And then I had to reread it! And I was incredibly relieved to see I still liked it quite a lot. It wasn\u2019t a bad story!\nGlancing at your ISFDB page, you must have well over a hundred short stories out. Which short stories stand among your favorites, and why?\nIt\u2019s probably closer to, I don\u2019t know . . . I tried to count at some point. Over 150 professional sales? I just like writing short stories. It\u2019s a very personal sort of reward\u2014I never get any award nominations for them or anything, but I get paid pretty well, though of course it\u2019s a tiny fraction of what you make on novels. So I mostly just write them for myself.\nI really like \u201cThe Projected Girl,\u201d which I wrote for Ellen Datlow. It\u2019s set in 80s Israel, about a mystery in 40s Israel, and it\u2019s ambiguous whether it\u2019s fantasy or not. It\u2019s liminal fantasy. And I wrote it in my last month in Vanuatu when I was renting a room from a guy who is now the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I just wrote it like in a dream in about two weeks. I kinda hoped it would get like a World Fantasy Award or something but they ended up giving it to me for Osama instead so I couldn\u2019t even complain!\nAnd I like a story called \u201cTutim,\u201d which no one would publish so it ended up in my book with Shimon Adaf, Art And War (which then no one ever read!). It\u2019s about a poet on the run who wrote a book called \u201cThe Death of Hebrew Poetry\u201d and the story\u2019s title is an homage to the poem (\u201cTutim,\u201d or \u201cStrawberries\u201d) by Yonah Wallach. I think it\u2019s very funny, in a savage sort of way.\nAnd the Central Station stories have obviously been very good to me. I have a particular soft spot for all my novellas. The Vanishing Kind, which is alternate history noir, Jesus and the Eightfold Path, which is a very tongue-in-cheek retelling of the Jesus story with kung fu. My most recent one is SF, \u201cNew Atlantis\u201d in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and my next one, The Big Blind, which will be out from PS Publishing, is about a poker-playing nun. Not genre at all! I just wanted to write this story so I did.\nI\u2019ve been writing more crime fiction recently because some anthologies popped up to allow me to do that. I got nominated for the CWA Dagger last year for one of them and that was very cool. I had to dress up and everything! I had to buy black trousers! I had a crime novelette out last year, \u201cThe Bell,\u201d which I like a lot. And I like the new SF stories I\u2019ve been writing recently, like \u201cVenus in Bloom\u201d which is right here in Clarkesworld. I don\u2019t know. Ask me another day and I\u2019ll probably pick different stories!\nYou have written a massive amount of words between 2003 and today, and it doesn\u2019t look like your career ever had a lull; you seem to have been putting out work consistently for nearly two decades. Were you ever in a place where you struggled to write, to produce, or to sell work? Or where doubt crept in? Or do you tend to be a writer who just pumps out material without worrying too much about it?\nTwo decades! You make me sound old! I have to admit it\u2019s weird \u2019cause you start off as going against the establishment and then one day you realize you are the establishment . . . Sooner or later they co-opt you!\nBut it\u2019s always a struggle. Always. My agent describes it as trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. No one knows what to do with me. So it\u2019s always a fight. And it can be pretty demoralizing, sure. But I like what I do, so I always think, I\u2019m just going to write what I want and then see if someone will publish it. When I told my agent about A Man Lies Dreaming I just said \u201cAdolf Hitler: Private Eye\u201d and he burst out laughing. And then, to his credit, he said I should write it. He said there was no way in hell he could sell it, but I should write it! And the funny thing is, all these weird books that no one knows what to do with kind of work out for me.\nI struggled a lot after A Man Lies Dreaming because I didn\u2019t know how to follow a book like that. So I kind of went sideways and wrote a children\u2019s book that is called Candy in the UK, which is coming out this year in the US as The Candy Mafia. And no one knew what to do with it either. Then I got lucky on it just before the Frankfurt Book Fair one autumn and it paid for a couple of years. But it turned out no one knows what to do with me in children\u2019s publishing either! I\u2019m hoping to stick around, though. I enjoy writing them. And in a way, I think Candy and A Man Lies Dreaming are very similar books, even if one\u2019s about Hitler and the Holocaust and the other\u2019s about a girl detective and chocolate smugglers. As long as the kids don\u2019t pick up the Hitler book, I should be fine. My other new book, it was supposed to be out this year but might be next year now, is called The Escapement. It\u2019s a book I really love, but I keep describing it as a \u201cclown Western,\u201d and as it turns out, everyone hates clowns. Which is part of the point, of course! But I think currently Tachyon, the publisher, are going with something like \u201cThe Gunslinger meets The Phantom Tollbooth.\u201d Don\u2019t ask me\u2014I just write \u2019em! It\u2019s a surrealist fantasy inspired by Michael Ende, Dr. Seuss, and spaghetti Westerns. With a bit of the Epic of Gilgamesh and Buster Keaton. That sort of thing.\nCentral Station was the one book I put five or six years into but I wasn\u2019t sure how to make it work and really didn\u2019t have any faith in it at all. I was just going to self-publish. But Gardner Dozois really believed in it and told me not to play it down. He thought it was an important book. And then my agent really saw something in it. And Tachyon bought it and basically sent me an editorial letter that just said, \u201cdo this, do that, cut this, rearrange that\u201d and the whole thing fell into place. But I didn\u2019t think anyone would read it! Nothing happens in that book! I\u2019m still bemused about the whole thing, to be honest. And it\u2019s been really successful for me. I even got to launch it in China last year, and that was a trip! That was so much fun. I\u2019ve been in talks about a television adaptation at some point but there\u2019s been nothing concrete. The funny thing is, it\u2019s my only science fiction book! I mostly write SF in short form. I\u2019d love to do more.\nDo you feel like your writing has changed in important ways since your first few stories came out? Do you feel like your work transformed in 2010, or are there other reasons why the SF community took greater notice of your work?\nDoes anyone really take notice of my work? It would be nice to think so, but . . . Although I recently found out Sting was a big fan of A Man Lies Dreaming. He raved about it in some interview. That was pretty surreal. I don\u2019t know. My first novel was only published in 2010 so maybe that\u2019s it\u2014people generally pay more attention to novels than short stories. Osama, which came out in 2011, that was another book no one would touch. It got rejected by every publisher out there. And it ended up winning the World Fantasy Award. So that was a really nice thing to happen. Especially after being roundly kicked, as it were! It just came out in Russia in January this year, so it\u2019s still going strong! I don\u2019t know, I just plod along and do my thing. I guess you sort of hope when a new book comes out there\u2019d be a parade outside, and a marching band, and balloons, but it\u2019s just . . . OK so there\u2019s another book out, go do the dishes.\nI would hope my writing has improved, though! I\u2019m generally pretty happy with how stuff turns out these days, though it\u2019s hard work. I can only really write what I write, I can\u2019t control what people want to read. I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky that publishers still, improbably, buy my books. And short fiction editors, bless every one of them. I seem to straddle several worlds, but genre, on the whole, has been very welcoming.\nIn your 2013 Locus interview you talked about Philip K. Dick\u2019s kibbutz on Mars, saying \u201cThat\u2019s the only time I ever saw myself in American science fiction books (\u2018That\u2019s me!\u2019).\u201d Do you feel like this has changed significantly? Especially with the rise in variety of voices and settings in genre fiction? Or do you feel like your background and cultural experiences are still largely overlooked?\nWell, I do have a pretty unusual background, to be fair . . . Have you seen any other kibbutzim in science fiction recently? When I went to China last year I did a whole bunch of interviews about Central Station, and as kind of a joke, I said, you know, it\u2019s the best science fiction novel ever written to be set in Tel Aviv but, as it\u2019s also the only SF novel to be set in Tel Aviv it must by default also be the worst.\nBut yeah, things have changed tremendously since 2013\u2014since 2009, actually, when I was putting together the first World SF anthology. And one of the things that made me really happy is that you can see all the international writers I was picking up for the anthologies early on now have major careers, big novels out, awards won, which would have been unimaginable ten years ago. There was so obviously this pool of talent that, I hate to say it, went unacknowledged for too long. And it\u2019s wonderful to see it slowly turning around. But it\u2019s still difficult! All of us have heard the \u201cWe don\u2019t publish books set in X\u201d rejection at some point or another. We don\u2019t do Mexican books! We don\u2019t do books set in Nigeria! Or when I was writing Unholy Land and pretty much being told, you know, no one in the UK wants to read a book about a bunch of Jews in Africa. You know, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be set in New York, or at least London?\u201d\nSo there\u2019s this massive disconnect, there\u2019s this weird American perception that New York writing is somehow the pinnacle of Western literature (and by default, all literature), while in England you kind of celebrate this sort of very anemic writing\u2014it was Raymond Chandler who said the English may not make the best writers in the world but they do make the best boring writers.\nAnd I don\u2019t get it. I think, actually, genre fiction\u2014science fiction and fantasy\u2014lead the pack in terms of featuring new, international voices. Of at least engaging with the question of diversity in literature while everyone else is lagging behind. But it\u2019s still . . . easier to write a novel set in England. Even if I\u2019m parodying or making fun of the British, like in A Man Lies Dreaming or By Force Alone. It\u2019s much scarier to write a novel set in Israel, for example. And what I sort of want to do is to turn to the \u201cMatter of Israel\u201d in a way at some point. But then Unholy Land sort of did that a little bit, and after that I did want to change tack a bit. I think it\u2019s why I really like The Escapement\u2014it\u2019s my only non political novel, it\u2019s a fantasy in a sort of surrealist secondary world, it\u2019s like a fable or a fairy tale if those had bounty hunters and clowns anyway. And yet it doesn\u2019t feel any less significant.\nIn your Clarkesworld interview in 2013 you talked briefly about travel and its impact on your writing, saying, \u201cI have set stories widely across the world, and I\u2019ve lived in many of those places, I am increasingly uncomfortable with doing that\u2014I am feeling more and more that I need to concentrate on my personal background, heritage, geography. I\u2019m conflicted, in a way.\u201d How does your recent work stand in relationship to this statement; have your feelings changed or developed since then?\nWell . . . I\u2019ve recently been writing more stories set quite widely, though I hope my . . . approach to them has been more nuanced. It\u2019s hard to say. I feel more comfortable with them\u2014stories like \u201cNeom\u201d in Asimov\u2019s last year, which is set in Saudi Arabia, or \u201cYiwu\u201d at Tor.com, which is set in China. I just finished a new one set in Mongolia, where I got to draw again on, you know, having been there and just being able to pull on some small details but the sort you wouldn\u2019t get otherwise. But I\u2019m writing about outsiders. I think that\u2019s my concession, which I think is the new global condition, really. Chinese in Poland, Sudanese in Israel, you know, the world\u2019s become Peruvian Japanese cuisine! I went to a Peruvian Japanese restaurant in Spain 2-3 years ago with a couple of much more successful writers and I was really hoping someone else would pick up the bill! Luckily one of their publishers did. It was not the cheapest place . . .\nBut it\u2019s still tricky! I guess I feel better about it, too, because since that interview I did write Central Station and Unholy Land, which are exactly the sort of difficult, personal background books I meant. So I feel better about it. I\u2019d be disappointed with myself if I hadn\u2019t done that. And that was very much the thinking behind it.\nCan you talk a bit about your experiences with different forms, specifically what you have enjoyed or disliked about any that stand out, but especially about the ways in which writing Adler (a creator-owned five-issue comic with art by Paul McCaffrey) is different or similar to other forms?\nI\u2019m fascinated by form, it\u2019s true. Sometimes you can actually look at the same story and try to write it in different mediums\u2014it is a screenplay? A comics script? Is it prose? I actually have projects that exist in different forms. There\u2019s an issue #1 comics script of The Violent Century somewhere on my hard drive, and a screenplay of Adler. And an Osama stage play.\nI got involved in writing an opera for the Royal Opera House a while back and that fell through. That was a shame. I would have loved to have done that. One of my dreams is to bring Osama: The Musical to the stage at some point. People look at me funny when I say that, but I\u2019m entirely serious! Came close to doing theater once or twice and that didn\u2019t work out so far. But I\u2019m realizing that whatever I do will be weird, so . . .\n\u201cSvalbard\u201d was so much fun to do, because I\u2019ve always been interested in the idea of interactive fiction. And it was combined with Jake doing these fiendishly difficult puzzles you have to unlock to read the story! And the story itself is a part of the final puzzle. It was very cool.\nI love working with artists, too. There\u2019s a real magic in writing something and having it come to life through art. Adler was a real labor of love for Paul and me. It took like seven years! His art gets so transcendent by issue #5, I kind of told him if I\u2019d known I would have written him something better to draw! It\u2019s a fun comic, though, it will be a great graphic novel come August.\nI\u2019m not sure anyone is ever going to let me write comics again so I\u2019m just riding it and having fun. We signed issue #1 in London when it came out and we were supposed to be at Dublin Comic Con for issue #2, but now . . . Anyway it will give Paul more time\u2014the poor man is still coloring! I\u2019m just taking the glory.\nRight now, I\u2019m working on animation with my friend Nir Yaniv\u2014it\u2019s a very DIY sort of project, but we have these voice actors involved and it\u2019s kind of evolving quickly, and it was only supposed to be a little side project to keep me from getting bored! I have no idea where it\u2019s going. And now people are asking to get in on it! And I\u2019m like, but why! I just love doing these ridiculous things that make no sense. That pretty much describes my entire career, probably.\nYour next book, By Force Alone, is out soon from Head of Zeus and Tor. It\u2019s a retelling of Arthurian myth from a completely different angle. What is it, do you think, about Arthurian tales that typically draw people to them? And what made you want to take them on\u2014to tear them down and rebuild them with a very different lens?\nI never had any interest in Arthurian mythology\u2014something something Merlin, something something sword in the stone, something Camelot, etc. Then I kind of had to study it because I rashly agreed to replace someone teaching on an undergrad course at my old university, and he\u2019s a Medievalist (and I\u2019m not a lecturer! I just got roped into it! If only I knew what I was letting myself in for!). So I was reading up on it and realized, firstly, that the whole thing wasn\u2019t just made up but it\u2019s sort of like a shared world fan fiction project, where one guy came up with the basic story and then everyone else kept adding bits to it. So someone comes up with Lancelot, someone comes up with the Green Knight, someone else goes, hey, sword in a stone! Someone else adds the round table. And so on to the grail. So without these guys in the twelfth century who came up with the whole grail mythology there\u2019d be no Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, there\u2019d be no Da Vinci Code! I thought well, that\u2019s interesting.\nAnd the other thing I realized was, I\u2019m reading the story, and it\u2019s supposed to be about chivalry and honor, and it\u2019s . . . it\u2019s not! It\u2019s an awful story. And I suddenly realized it\u2019s basically a gangster story. It\u2019s the rise and fall. It\u2019s The Godfather, it\u2019s Scarface. And then I thought, well, that I can work with.\nSo I looked around but everyone else was doing the story the way we\u2019re told it goes, not the way it actually goes. I was really surprised. So I went for it. I thought it offered some really interesting opportunities to talk about nationalism right now. And also, I thought it would be fun to have Lancelot as a Jewish Nubian kung fu master. Even if I had to write 70,000 words before I even got to the Jewish Nubian kung fu part. I wrote it over about a year and a half, just for myself. I think only my agent vaguely knew I was writing some sort of Arthurian book. And then of course one early rejection was that people don\u2019t want this version of Arthur! They want the \u201ccomfort and nostalgia of the original tales\u201d! Which cracked me up! So much so that I worked that line into the book. I think it\u2019s a very funny book. About nationalism. With a bit of kung fu. It\u2019s a big book, that was a departure for me. I\u2019ve been writing these short novels and this one felt massive in comparison.\nWhat are you working on now? What do you have coming up that you can tell us about? And\u2014back to the \u201cforms\u201d idea\u2014are there forms/formats/projects you haven\u2019t tried yet that you are thinking about taking on?\nPublishing-wise, I have By Force Alone in June (it\u2019s just come out in the UK), and then my children\u2019s book, The Candy Mafia, which is gorgeously illustrated, I think, is out in September. And the graphic novel omnibus of Adler comes out in August! Plus my novella The Big Blind should be out from PS Publishing in September. And I\u2019m currently working on an anthology.\nNext year will probably see The Escapement out from Tachyon, which means the next book after that will be The Circumference of the World\u2014it\u2019s sort of my . . . \u201cwhat if L. Ron Hubbard was right\u201d book. What if this sci fi writer in the 50s came up with some crazy idea about the real nature of the world and it turned out he was right. It\u2019s sort of several stories woven into one, including a biblio-mystery, a coming-of-age story in the South Pacific, a gangster story, and a 50s sci fi pastiche. I\u2019m still working on it! There are so many drafts of it at this point it\u2019s hard to know how it will end up. Then there will be my next book following By Force Alone, which is already contracted to Head of Zeus in the UK, and should be out in 2021. It\u2019s another \u201cMatter of Britain\u201d novel. I stupidly pitched it as a quartet so I do have notes for the next two books, but in the meantime I\u2019ll probably go and write a crime novel or something.\nAt the moment, as I mentioned earlier, I\u2019m working on a couple of animation projects\u2014a weird short film and a miniature web series. These are a lot of fun. I\u2019m hoping we can debut them soon, though it will probably be a while yet. And I promised Paul McCaffrey I\u2019d write him a big space SF graphic novel to draw. So I need to do that . . . And I have the usual short stories coming out. There are always the short stories!\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

Her hands were shaking; she had barely gotten out. The Meghnad Saha, a Class B planet surveyor she\u2019d called home, retreated from the aft view screen, dropping rapidly from the orbital plane, pulled down by a force from the planet.\n \u201cTripp?\u201d Amrita said.\n After a moment, a voice from the surveyor: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear I\u2019m going to be able to stop this thing.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have come with me in the pod.\u201d\n \u201cHindsight. I\u2019ll keep trying. Here comes the blackout. Goodbye. Sorry . . . \u201d\n \u201cTripp?\u201d\n Nothing.\n Amrita tracked the Meghnad Saha all the way to the surface. She tried repeatedly to resume contact but Tripp wouldn\u2019t answer. Transcyber Reactive Positronic Personality: Tripp, for short, and the only friend Amrita had, or wanted. If he survived the crash, she wasn\u2019t about to abandon him. She blinked tears away and began to configure her escape pod for descent.\n The Kabbhan forbade landing on Trappist-1e, or even approaching the planet within a designated radius of three hundred thousand kilometers. Because the Kabbhan stargates had made interstellar travel possible for humans in the first place, everyone respected this single restriction. Everybody but Amrita, who was signatory to no such agreement.\n A proximity alert began beeping in the escape pod. Amrita considered a quick burn for radical descent. Get down before anyone could stop her. But it was already too late.\n The Kabbhan star cruiser emerged like a sperm whale from a shot glass. Above the planet\u2019s horizon an elongated node appeared, squeezed forth, and popped: the cruiser, bigger than anything Melville dreamed of, came alongside Amrita\u2019s two-seat escape pod in synchronous orbit one hundred and eighty kilometers above the planet\u2019s largest continental mass. Amrita put her nose to the viewport. A massive wall shut out the stars.\n With the back of her hand she wiped sweat off her upper lip, and waited. Eventually, the alien spoke, via comlink\u2014at least it appeared that way. The green comlink indicator blinked on Amrita\u2019s vaporware display, and she heard the expected transmission hiss. But she knew Kabbhan technology was not what it appeared to be. Even calling it technology was a mistake.\n Earth ship. Prepare to receive Kabbhan personnel.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Out of nowhere, a man appeared at her elbow, already strapped into the right seat. Amrita would have jumped out of her skin, if that were possible. Actually, it was possible; the Kabbhan had demonstrated as much by becoming the only known race to have achieved transphysical migration.\n \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d she demanded.\n The man turned to her. \u201cThe sum of your expectations.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve heard that one before. You\u2019re a Kabbhan presentation?\u201d\n The Kabbhan probed minds to find materials with which to construct compatible presentations. A Kabbhanian presentation acted as a surrogate presence. No one had ever seen an actual Kabbhan and very few had seen their presentations. Those who had seen a presentation reported a disorienting experience. While the presentation existed only in the probed subject\u2019s mind, it activated all the necessary neural and sensory pathways to create an apparently physical manifestation. Apparent to the one being probed, at least. In short, the right seat was empty.\n \u201cYou may regard me as Dad.\u201d\n \u201cDad! I don\u2019t think so. Besides, you don\u2019t even look like him.\u201d\n Not that Amrita remembered her father, her \u201cdad,\u201d except as a degraded holo she\u2019d discovered in a lockbox after her mother died. Among the few important documents still mandated to exist in physical form were scattered a handful of personal items, trinkets accumulated over a long life. Amrita used her thumbnail to pry open a silver locket stamped with an impression of Shiva\u2014and wham! her father leaped out and stood flickering before her. She knew it was her father, because who else could it be? Old fashioned hololockets like this one had been romantic keepsakes when Amrita\u2019s mother was young, and she had only ever loved one man\u2014as she frequently reiterated. In later years, after she found happiness with a microbiologist named Brenda on the colony world Deneb V1, she added: One was enough.\n The holo had been that of a young man, handsome, after a predictable fashion. But there was a sly, cunning light in his eye that suggested a con man\u2019s motivations. Eye, not eyes. The holo\u2019s degradation had turned Amrita\u2019s young father into a puzzle of many missing pieces\u2014including the piece with his right eye. A therapist had once suggested that Amrita had spent her life, unconsciously of course, searching for the missing pieces of dear old dad. It accounted for her lack of respect for rules and authority figures. Amrita responded: \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d She had been under court order to participate in ten therapeutic sessions. The court order came as a result of a juvenile misadventure involving a stolen moon skimmer and a high-speed chase across the Mare Serenitatis. Had she been eighteen instead of thirteen, the consequences would have been dire, not therapeutic. The \u201cYou\u2019re joking\u201d remark had been in session number two. The next eight preceded unproductively.\n This Kabbhan presentation didn\u2019t look anything like the holo. It was older, for one thing. A man of late middle age, with silver-streaked hair combed back in a pompadour, and wrinkles around his brown eyes.\n \u201cThere is no error,\u201d he said.\n \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to stop me. Because I\u2019m telling you right now, I am going down there to get my friend.\u201d\n \u201cStopping you isn\u2019t my intention. I\u2019m here to assure your survival. We Kabbhan feel a certain responsibility towards less evolved species endangered by our discarded artifacts, even though our warnings have been explicit. Shall we descend now? If you are prepared, of course.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m prepared. Dad.\u201d\n Amrita manipulated vaporware toggles, like twiddling fingers in a particularly well-organized steam cloud. The pod altered orbital trajectory, and Trappist-1e\u2019s very large horizon became larger still. Amrita glanced at the rearview screen. The Kabbhan starship was gone, as if it had never been there. And it hadn\u2019t been. Like Dad, the ship had been the sum of Amrita\u2019s expectations, this time in regards to alien spacecraft. The Kabbhan thought that beings stuck in the physical required corresponding illusions. Maybe they were right.\n Amrita\u2019s escape pod burned through the atmosphere at hypersonic speed. Curtains of fire fluttered across the ports, then blew away, revealing an expanse of salmon-colored twilight. It was midday on Trappist-1e and as bright as it ever got. Six more alphabet planets hung in the sky like a God\u2019s game of crescents and balls.\n From altitude, the self-expanding megalopolis looked like a continent-covering crust, an eczema salted with glittering lights.\n \u201cWhat a sight,\u201d Amrita said.\n Dad nodded. \u201cWhen the last of us migrated out of the physical, the automated city-builders on this colony planet ran amok. That was more than a hundred Sol years ago, by your time measure.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s so much.\u201d\n \u201cIndeed. Construction has proceeded unchecked, consuming every available mineral resource, husking out the planet even as it gradually covers its surface with an abandoned-before-built city.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happens when the builders run out of land?\u201d\n \u201cThey continue into the sea, erecting piers and floating platforms on the surface, and submerged suburbs of pressure domes and interlinking tubular passageways. They can and do build anything.\u201d\n Amrita banked the escape pod and dropped several thousand meters, slipping across the sky at dizzying speed. She felt it in her gut, the swoop of gravity-assisted acceleration. Dad sat placidly, watching out the port. As they drew nearer, details emerged from the crust. Towers, blocks, domes, heptagons, pyramids, complex ribbons of transportation infrastructure . . .\n \u201cThere,\u201d Dad said.\n A trench of smoldering destruction. Amrita slowed the pod\u2019s descent, swooped in close, and hovered. Machines, like giant stalk-legged spiders, swarmed the trench, collecting into piles the remains of shattered buildings. Energy beams fired from the spiders\u2019 underbellies. Brilliant flashes, like small nuclear detonations, burst upon Amrita\u2019s eyeballs. She looked away and spent a few seconds blinking the blue-white afterimages out of her eyes. When she looked back, the debris had been reduced to slag.\n \u201cThe city-builders will digest the material,\u201d Dad said, \u201cand recycle it into the construction matrix.\u201d\n The builders, or nanoswarms, grew buildings from the ground up. Even now, the trench gradually filled with new growth, like an invisible surgeon knitting a wound.\n Amrita flew her pod over the trench. At the end of it lay the Meghnad Saha, broken-backed and nose up. Smoke trailed from rents in the engine compartment and crew cabin, while instruments of the city proceeded with dissection. Giant mechanical mantises peeled off titanium plates, like strips of bark from a fallen tree. They cast the plates down for the spiders to gather, evaluate, and slag.\n Amrita loitered above the spectacle. She opened a channel. \u201cTripp?\u201d\n White noise.\n Dad said, \u201cHe may not have survived.\u201d\n \u201cOr he may have survived.\u201d\n Dad put his hand over hers. Amrita\u2019s parietal lobe received nerve impulses, as though someone was actually touching her skin. Dad\u2019s eyes swam with empathy, which she didn\u2019t trust. \u201cI need to know for certain,\u201d Amrita said, and pushed her hand forward. The illusion of Dad\u2019s fingers slid away. She reached into the vaporware display, activated the sensor array, and swept the wreckage.\n \u201cHe\u2019s not there. I don\u2019t read his power core\u2019s signature.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps he has been digested.\u201d\n \u201cThe radioactive core would still register.\u201d\n Amrita broadened the search, scanning the surrounding area as rapidly as possible, worried that the builders would take notice and pull her down with tractor beams, just as they\u2019d done to the Meghnad Saha. Then Tripp\u2019s signature appeared. \u201cGot him! He\u2019s on the move.\u201d\n She locked down the location and deactivated the sensor array. \u201cDo you think the builders know I\u2019m here?\u201d Her pod was shielded from sensor examination, but then the Meghnad Saha had been, too.\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid they do now, Pumpkin.\u201d\n Pumpkin?\n That was the color of the Martian sky above Burroughsville, the main Cydonia colony, where Amrita spent her first six years. Her real dad had never called her \u2018Pumpkin\u2019 or anything else that she recalled. She had only one vague and retreating memory of him walking out the door of their hab. She didn\u2019t remember him; she remembered his back as he walked away. She remembered the door sliding closed, leaving her fatherless. She remembered her mother\u2019s tears. And anger. Not long after that her mother requested reassignment to Luna, dragging Amrita along to the land of stark desert contrasts and no friends. The moon skimmer incident was inevitable, and would have happened sooner, if Amrita had been tall enough to reach the controls.\n Pumpkin was what Ideal Dad called her\u2014back when she was five years old and in need of a father who called her something, anything. Ideal Dad: AKA made-up-dad: AKA Kabbhan presentation. From the quantum flux the Kabbhan had probed her mind and found a ghost who had never lived. Amrita now recognized the physical template, though, the silvered pompadour, the kind eyes. They belonged to a man she used to see walking around the buried corridors between Burroughsville habs. Some kind of maintenance man, originally from New Delhi, on Earth.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d she said to the presentation, \u201cdon\u2019t call me that again.\u201d\n Dad nodded. \u201cAll right, Amrita.\u201d\n \u201cNobody in my life has ever called me \u2018Pumpkin.\u2019\u201d\n Dad listened respectfully.\n \u201cAnd don\u2019t look at me that way, either.\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Am I looking at you incorrectly?\u201d\n Amrita narrowed her eyes. \u201cAre you being funny?\u201d\n \u201cI doubt it. Before the Great Migration I was considered by my friends to be on the dour side. Also, in the quantum flux, no one tells jokes. We Kabbhan no longer exist as individuals, except when it becomes necessary to create a presentation. Telling jokes in the flux would be like telling jokes to a mirror.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re being serious.\u201d\n \u201cThen I am a poor communicator, which is a failing I was not accused of prior to migration.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, that\u2019s plenty.\u201d\n \u201cPlenty?\u201d\n \u201cOf you talking.\u201d\n Amrita looked for a place to set down. She flexed her hands, worried. \u201cThe builders won\u2019t attack?\u201d\n \u201cAttack? The builders don\u2019t attack anything. They\u2019re hungry for building material, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n \u201cIt looked like they were attacking the Meghnad Saha.\u201d\n \u201cPreparing it for digestion,\u201d Dad said. \u201cLocal resources are finite. The builders hunt constantly for materials. When your surveyor skimmed the atmosphere it became a potential resource. You were warned of this, were you not?\u201d\n \u201cI shielded the ship. It should have been invisible.\u201d Amrita had been attracted to Trappist-1e by its forbiddenness. She had wanted to see what no human had seen, and she wanted to see it because everyone from the Kabbhan themselves to the Gate Authority in the Epsilon Cygni system had told her she couldn\u2019t.\n \u201cInsufficient,\u201d Dad said. \u201cYour sensor scan revealed you.\u201d\n \u201cAll right. Will the builders try to digest me?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not. They don\u2019t digest living organisms.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s great for me, but Tripp isn\u2019t a living organism.\u201d\n Amrita concentrated on her maneuvering controls. She lowered the pod between soaring towers that reduced even the twilight to full night. Landing lights planted cones on a pristine avenue no Kabbhan (or human, for that matter) had ever trod. Gear extended, and moments later pneumatic suspension units absorbed the pod\u2019s touchdown.\n Amrita idled the engines and unstrapped. \u201cTripp is close. I\u2019ll go get him. When I come back, you\u2019ll have to give up your seat.\u201d\n Dad nodded. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m not actually in the seat, anyway. But I don\u2019t think you should leave the pod.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cThe builders won\u2019t harm a living organism, but once you climb out, the pod will become a construction resource. They seized your planet surveyor only after you abandoned ship.\u201d\n Amrita bristled. \u201cI didn\u2019t abandon anything. Tripp shoved me into the pod. He overreacted to the builder\u2019s tractor beam.\u201d\n \u201cYes. It wouldn\u2019t have pulled the ship down, not while you were aboard.\u201d\n \u201cTripp was trying to protect me.\u201d\n Dad regarded her empathetically. \u201cI see.\u201d\n Amrita switched on her comlink. \u201cTripp? You\u2019re out there. Answer me.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t reply.\n \u201cHe\u2019s probably turned off his communication device. Receiving your signal might direct the builders to him. Amrita, remaining here is dangerous.\u201d\n \u201cYou said the builders wouldn\u2019t digest a living organism.\u201d\n \u201cNo. But once you walk away, your ship becomes a resource. I suggest you fly us out of the city. I will give you a safe destination.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not leaving Tripp.\u201d\n \u201cHmm.\u201d Dad tilted his head. \u201cHe\u2019s artificial, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d\n \u201cNothing, I suppose.\u201d\n Dad tapped two fingers against his lower lip. It\u2019s something Amrita herself used to do when she was little, a pensive tick that she transferred to Ideal Dad to help make him more real. It really irritated her that the Kabbhan presentation had adopted it. The maintenance worker from New Delhi had probably had ticks and mannerisms of his own, but Amrita pointedly avoided learning what they were. She wanted only to see him in the corridor sometimes and think, My dad\u2019s going to work. But at night she hoarded his image and turned it into a wonderful father. He wasn\u2019t a maintenance man but a gardener. Like Ideal Dad himself, the garden didn\u2019t exist. Amrita liked to imagine it in a vast underground vault with a pretend sky adrift with fluffy white clouds. She liked to imagine tall sunflowers (she\u2019d seen pictures in school) nodding on their stalks. Dad played a game with her, telling stories of the sunflowers, which were special Martian sunflowers and could think and had personalities because they contained the lost souls of the vanished inhabitants of Mars.\n Amrita put her helmet on. \u201cHe\u2019s inside that tower. I\u2019m going to get him. I\u2019ll remote-fly the pod, set it to execute an evasive pattern to avoid the tractor beams and then return. That should work, if I make the pattern tricky enough.\u201d\n \u201cIt might. For a short time.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n Dad sighed.\n Amrita programmed the maneuver, then belted on her sidearm and climbed out of the pod. She felt the planet\u2019s pull, the gravity twice that of Mars but significantly less than Earth\u2019s. She had lived on both worlds. Earth was prettier, but Mars (and Luna) was easier on her spine. The heating coils in her suit warmed her against the outside temperature, which hung just above freezing. How was anybody supposed to live on this planet?\n When she turned, Dad already stood in the street. She said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that anymore, either.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t do what anymore?\u201d\n \u201cPop in and out. If you\u2019re going to act physical, act it all the way.\u201d\n Dad nodded. \u201cIf it makes you happy.\u201d\n \u201cNothing makes me happy. Hold on.\u201d\n She used her wrist controller to spin up the pod\u2019s engines. Dad watched her impassively, tapping his lower lip.\n \u201cStop doing that,\u201d Amrita said.\n Dad stopped.\n Amrita focused on the pod. It began to rise. The speed of its ascent increased. Amrita held her breath, waiting for the invisible lasso of a tractor beam to grab the pod and smash it down. But the pod climbed above the skyline and darted away\u2014safe, for now.\n \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t come back,\u201d Amrita said, \u201cWe\u2019re all marooned here.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not here in the first place,\u201d Dad said. \u201cBut leave that aside. You are marooned whether or not the pod returns.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cYour pod cannot withstand the forces found within our gate.\u201d\n The Kabbhan stargates linked distant locations within the Milky Way. When humans discovered the gate shimmering in Jupiter space, it had opened the galaxy to human exploration. Only the gate in the Epsilon Cygni system was forbidden. Entering it, Amrita had been instantly transported across nearly twelve parsecs to the Trappist-1 system.\n Amrita\u2019s heart beat faster. She had suspected the escape pod was insufficiently sturdy for the stargate, but she had intended to chance it, anyway. Now she didn\u2019t know what to do. Taking a risk was one thing, suicide was another. \u201cAnother ship will come,\u201d she said.\n \u201cNo ships come here.\u201d\n \u201cMine did.\u201d\n \u201cAmrita, no one wants to come here.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\n Dad nodded, as though he were nodding at a child who had just vowed to stay up all night.\n \u201cI will help you settle on this world. There is a lovely island situated on the terminator, where the temperature range is more compatible for your human physiology. In your remaining lifespan the builders will not reach it. Conditions may be challenging at first.\u201d\n \u201cWell, shit,\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cEverything is going to be okay . . . \u201d\n Pumpkin.\n With her dad, Amrita walked alone down the broad Kabbhan avenue. From deep in the city came the creaking, groaning sounds of nano construction.\n \u201cWhat a waste of time this place is,\u201d Amrita said. \u201cAll these buildings and no one to live in them or work in them.\u201d\n \u201cTime,\u201d Dad said, shaking his head. \u201cAn odd concept.\u201d\n Amrita looked at him, unable to ignore what she rationally knew wasn\u2019t there. \u201cWhat\u2019s odd about it?\u201d\n Dad said, \u201cFirst of all, \u2018time\u2019 is an artificial construct. How do you waste a construct? In the Flux\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDad? I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, sorry. In the Flux we aren\u2019t influenced by moods.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Amrita stopped walking and turned on him. \u201cIf it\u2019s so wonderful in the Flux, what are you even doing here?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not here.\u201d\n Amrita closed her eyes briefly. \u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d\n \u201cI told you. I came to help you survive.\u201d\n \u201cRight. Because you feel responsible. Now what\u2019s the other reason?\u201d\n Dad shrugged. \u201cI happen to enjoy inhabiting a presentation. Among my fellow Kabbhan that makes me unusual.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you\u2019re having a wonderful time.\u201d\n \u201cI am.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Amrita looked around at the buildings. \u201cHe should be right here. Tripp, it\u2019s me! Tripp!\u201d\n Her words echoed down the canyon of tall buildings, all of them black and shiny-smooth and hollow. She approached the nearest, a tower that rose hundreds of meters, an immense heptagonal spear ending in a rounded point. The entrance to the lobby, or whatever the Kabbhan called it, stood open and doorless. Her helmet lights revealed the empty interior. She stepped inside and tilted her head back. Load-bearing supports crisscrossed all the way to the point. That was all.\n \u201cIt\u2019s called a shell,\u201d Dad said. \u201cI knew you were wondering.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t say anything.\n \u201cThe builders execute the architect\u2019s plan, create basic structures, the interiors to be added later, according to the wishes of future inhabitants. As there are no future inhabitants, the city itself is now, and will remain, a shell.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Amrita said. \u201cI just want to find my friend.\u201d\n From far away, a small voice, almost inaudible, said, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n Amrita squinted. The voice was so faint, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d even heard it. Wasn\u2019t sure whether it was outside of her head, or inside of it, another Kabbhan illusion, or what. She turned up the gain on her headset.\n \u201cTripp?\u201d\n \u201cOver here.\u201d\n She swung her headlamps in his direction. Tripp stood in a far corner of the shell, his back against the wall. He looked more or less human\u2014well, less\u2014but he had two arms and two legs and one oval-shaped head. She walked toward him, her footsteps echoing.\n \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\n \u201cMy leg was damaged in the crash. I barely managed to hobble this far. They almost got me. Now I can\u2019t move without falling.\u201d\n \u201cThey won\u2019t get you,\u201d Amrita said. \u201cI won\u2019t let them.\u201d\n Dad cleared his throat. Amrita ignored him.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t stop them,\u201d Tripp said.\n Amrita crouched and began examining the damaged leg. At the knee, a couple of carbon fiber rods bent in the wrong direction, inhibiting articulation.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d she said.\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m not really. It\u2019s just my positronic brain pretending to feel human emotions, so I will seem more companionable.\u201d\n She looked up. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed your honesty on this topic before.\u201d\n \u201cSorry.\u201d\n Amrita produced a multi-tool and began fiddling with the leg.\n \u201cThe weird thing is,\u201d Tripp said, \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I want you to.\u201d\n She looked up. \u201cWant me to what?\u201d\n \u201cStop them.\u201d\n Amrita stopped fiddling. \u201cWhy the Hell are you saying that?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s strangely compelling.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s strangely compelling?\u201d\n \u201cTo become part of the city,\u201d Tripp said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Would it be so bad? Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m already artificial, but these last hours, pretending to feel so afraid even when you were not here, hiding, getting my apparent dread of extinction organized to display when you showed up\u2014it\u2019s really made me think. My whole existence has been nothing but a performance.\u201d\n \u201cTripp!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m serious. If I simply walked out there, exposed myself, let them slag me, allowed myself to be digested and my elements to be recombined into the building matrix, wouldn\u2019t I be part of something greater than myself?\u201d\n \u201cTripp, please be quiet now.\u201d Listening to him made her feel lonely. \u201cI think the crash must have damaged more than your poor leg.\u201d\n \u201cNo, my brain is fully functional. You know, I was in communication with the Meghnad Saha even as the instrumentality dismantled her. She didn\u2019t display fear, because that isn\u2019t part of her reactive programming mask. But she was excited. I\u2019m certain of that. This may sound strange to you, but in the end she believed that to be digested was the greatest adventure. At least, that\u2019s what she said.\u201d\n \u201cShe did not.\u201d\n \u201cI suppose she may have been regurgitating something from the library that got mixed up in her damaged memory core. Anyway . . .\n \u201cHold still, please.\u201d Amrita loosened the bolt that attached the bent rods to Tripp\u2019s knee swivels. The bolt dropped to the ground. Gritting her teeth, she got a firm grip on one of the bent rods, wrenched it back and forth until it suddenly came loose. She fell on her ass, still holding the rod.\n \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Dad said. \u201cWe Kabbhan, like all physical beings of limited duration, lived our lives in fear. After the Great Migration, fear vanished\u2014along with our individual personalities, of course. It may be the same for artificial beings when faced with the prospect of joining the greater reality of the city.\u201d\n Amrita rolled to her knees. \u201cHave either of you even considered the virtue of silence?\u201d\n \u201cEither of you?\u201d Tripp said. \u201cWho else are you talking to?\u201d\n \u201cNobody. My dad.\u201d\n \u201cWhich is it?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re the same thing.\u201d\n Amrita resumed work on the second bent rod. She twisted and wrenched and pulled. It came free of its upper swivel but not the lower. Finally she gave up and let it dangle.\n \u201cTry that,\u201d she said.\n Tripp moved his good leg forward, planted it, then moved his damaged leg. The dangling bar tapped against the other rods and the knee wobbled slightly side-to-side. Tripp waved his arms for balance. Amrita scrambled to her feet to catch him, but he managed to remain upright without her.\n \u201cHow is it?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cUnstable. I\u2019m not sure this will work.\u201d\n \u201cKeep practicing, walk around.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d Tripp walked away into the shadows, the dangling carbon rod making a tap-tapping sound like a blind man\u2019s cane.\n \u201cThe builders will very probably take him,\u201d Dad said.\n Amrita turned on him, annoyed with herself for accepting his presence outside her head, where it wasn\u2019t. \u201cI could use a little optimism around here. You\u2019re supposed to be helping me, right? Well, do some helping, why don\u2019t you? Get us away from where Tripp is in danger. Get us to that island.\u201d\n \u201cI can take you there. The builders have no interest in a biological. But Tripp will inevitably be noticed.\u201d\n Amrita paced around, working her hands together, thinking. \u201cWhat if I turn the builders off? Isn\u2019t that what your people should have done before the Great Migration?\u201d\n \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible. In the absence of Kabbhan oversight, the builders have adapted and become self-motivated to complete the architect\u2019s plan. Only the architect can cancel the build.\u201d\n \u201cWho\u2019s the architect?\u201d\n \u201cSince they were left running, the builders devised their own plan.\u201d\n \u201cThe builders are their own architect?\u201d\n \u201cExactly.\u201d Dad spread his arms and turned in a circle. \u201cThey build. It\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s all they do. When the original plan was complete, they simply extended the parameters to include the entire planet. That way they will remain busy and fulfill the dictates of their primary function. But they are not sentient. No amount of logical persuasion will convince them to abandon their own plan.\u201d\n \u201cThat leaves Terminator Island, or whatever you call it.\u201d\n \u201cThe island has no name. Nothing here does.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s just go. Tripp!\u201d\n They emerged from the building in time to witness the arrival of a ten-meter-tall spider. Moments later, the pod came zig-zagging out of the sky and settled onto the same spot it had previously occupied. The spider stalked toward the pod.\n Amrita yelled, \u201cRun!\u201d\n Since she was the only one with working legs, she ran alone\u2014though Dad appeared to be running beside her.\n \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cYou said you wanted me to be physically consistent.\u201d\n Behind her, Tripp\u2019s dangling carbon rod clicked and knocked against his leg, like a syncopated timer.\n Amrita ripped her sidearm out of the holster but hesitated. \u201cDad, you\u2019re sure that thing won\u2019t attack me?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Amrita triggered her weapon. A pulsing white particle discharge cut across one of the spider\u2019s legs, severing it above the first joint. The spider stumbled and began tracking left. Amrita ran back to Tripp, pulled his arm across her shoulders, and helped him walk the remainder of the distance to the pod. He was light for an artificial.\n \u201cStand here.\u201d Amrita climbed the ladder and reached down. \u201cGive me your hand, I\u2019ll pull you up.\u201d\n But Tripp wasn\u2019t looking at her. He watched the spider circling itself, partially hobbled, and, to Amrita\u2019s horror, Tripp began limping towards it.\n \u201cTripp, what are you doing! Stop.\u201d\n Without looking at her, Tripp said, \u201cYou should fly away now. It\u2019s important that I serve a larger function. While the Meghnad Saha existed, my part of the larger function was assured. There is no larger function on your island.\u201d\n \u201cOur friendship is a larger function.\u201d Amrita felt an ache in her chest.\n Tripp didn\u2019t speak again but limped, loose rod tapping, over to the spider and held up his arms. The spider took notice, stopped chasing itself around in a circle, and slagged him.\n The ache in Amrita\u2019s chest intensified and became unbearable. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n From the right seat, already strapped in, Dad laid a comforting illusion on her shoulder. Her brain told her it was a father giving her a reassuring squeeze.\n \u201cWe\u2019d best go now, Pumpkin.\u201d\n She buckled herself into the pilot\u2019s seat, roughly wiped her eyes, spun up the engines, and sped into the sky, reaching maximum thrust within seconds. They achieved altitude and raced toward the sea.\n On tidally locked Trappist-1e, Terminator Island stood on the edge of eternal night. Amrita knelt in the powdery blue sand, breathing inside her helmet. \u201cI don\u2019t see any builders.\u201d\n \u201cThey exist everywhere but are too small to see.\u201d\n \u201cIf they\u2019re on the island, why aren\u2019t they already building their damned city?\u201d\n \u201cIt would be disorderly. The builders follow the architect\u2019s plan, in this case their own plan. And the plan is to build contiguously outward from the main continental mass. These builders would not become activated until the project arrived after crossing the ocean. That is a distant occurrence. In the meantime you can use the builders for your own project, once I tell you how to activate them according to your deeper architectural desires.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t have any deep architectural desires,\u201d Amrita grumbled.\n Dad, standing over her, said, \u201cOf course you do.\u201d\n Amrita was not Kabbhan. The nanobuilders did not naturally synch with her inner architect. But, because she was the only game in town, at least until the city arrived, eventually they made a connection. A good thing. The Trappist atmosphere was unbreathable, at least for humans. Sooner or later (probably sooner) the pod\u2019s emergency atmospheric conversion processor would break down.\n The builders started . . . building. Amrita had been dozing in the pod, lulled to unconsciousness by the wheeze and huff of the processor, which sucked in air and displaced most of the carbon dioxide with an artificially produced mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. The conversion unit was designed as a temporary stopgap. The replicating oxygen/nitrogen molecules on board would soon be depleted, and that would be the end of Amrita.\n A creaking, groaning sound plucked at her awareness, and she opened heavy eyelids. The atmosphere in the pod was thin, just barely enough to support her life. But like that she was wide awake. Around the pod, for a radius of fifty meters or more, walls built themselves up, gradually creating an enclosed space. At the same time invisible builders filled the still-exposed interior space with walls and corridors and furniture and apparatus familiar to Amrita, including a large atmospheric conversion unit. Fascinated, Amrita tore into a packet of emergency rations and watched the show. The builders worked quickly.\n At the point when she knew exactly what the builders were creating, Amrita turned to Dad, who was always at her side.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYour architect is a deep expectation, beyond your conscious control. I\u2019m sorry. The builders are designed to synch with Kabbhan brains, which were more limber, not human brains. This is what you get, I\u2019m afraid. At least it is life, yes?\u201d\n Outside the pod, a copy of Amrita\u2019s Burroughsville habitat took shape.\n Black. Inside the hab, if she wandered too far, the soothing blue and gold tones of her remembered home in Burroughsville segued into the shiny, smooth, black \u201cshell\u201d material of the Kabbhan city. Mostly, Amrita stayed in her room, reading her way through the pods\u2019 mirror library from when it was attached to the Meghnad Saha. A couple of times a day she left the hab and crossed to the farm. The walls of the farm enclosed a space twice the size of the hab. Using seeds and fertilizer packets from the escape pod\u2019s long-term planetary survival stores, Amrita had begun to grow her future diet of bland vegetables. Already leafy shoots had emerged. The sight both encouraged and depressed her. How long would she be stuck here?\n Sometimes, on her way back to the hab, she paused to gaze out over the sea. Beyond the horizon, the builders continued their work on the continent and beneath the waves. Tripp was now part of that building matrix. If he could pretend fear why couldn\u2019t he have pretended loyalty and stayed with her? Tripp was part of the city, but what was Amrita part of? She had spent her life devising ways to separate herself from her fellow humans. Now, for the first time, regret wormed into her heart.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he did it,\u201d she said one evening, when Dad came in to say goodnight. \u201cI thought we were friends.\u201d\n Dad sat on the bed. It was a perfect duplicate of Amrita\u2019s childhood bed. When she lay down to sleep, her legs extended beyond the mattress. \u201cPerhaps the friendship was more one-sided than you like to believe.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know him,\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cWas there something to know? He was artificial. Kabbhan could not have created a presentation from him, even. Tripp had more in common with the builders than with you.\u201d\n \u201cStop talking to me,\u201d Amrita said. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop and go away? I don\u2019t need you anymore.\u201d\n Dad held her hand. \u201cDo you really want me to leave, Pumpkin?\u201d\n By force of will, Amrita almost convinced herself that she couldn\u2019t feel the hand gently squeezing hers. She would have pulled free, except she could see, in her mind\u2019s eye, the grim comedy of her lying alone on the bed, talking to herself while twisting and pulling away from someone who wasn\u2019t there. It was easier to accept the illusion. Just as it had become easier to accept the illusion calling her \u201cPumpkin.\u201d Was there any point in fighting it? Besides, it would be too lonely without Dad, even though Dad wasn\u2019t really there.\n \u201cAt least make yourself appear in your original Kabbhan form.\u201d she said. \u201cThe Dad thing bothers me.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t do that. I no longer possess a self-image. To appear Kabbhan now would require a living Kabbhan mind from which to draw.\u201d\n \u201cYou won\u2019t try?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be pointless.\u201d Dad shook his head and chuckled. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really enjoying my temporary individuality.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Amrita turned away.\n \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBut what?\u201d She turned her head and looked at him.\n \u201cNothing.\u201d Dad smiled kindly. \u201cI went to the underground garden today.\u201d He gave her ankle a fatherly squeeze.\n Amrita groaned. Not this again. She turned away, facing the wall. \u201cThere is no underground garden.\u201d\n \u201cThe sunflower people want to tell their story, the story of old Mars.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk anymore,\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t I tell you a little of it?\u201d Dad suggested.\n \u201cJesus. I just said\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating, the story of old Mars.\u201d\n \u201cStop talking now.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be sharp with me, Pumpkin.\u201d\n Amrita rolled over and sat up. \u201cIt bothers me that you won\u2019t stop talking when I tell you to stop. You used to stop.\u201d\n Dad folded his hands in his lap and looked at them. \u201cI appreciate,\u201d he said, starting slowly, seeming to hunt carefully for the right words, \u201cthat I sometimes make you uncomfortable. But I hope you can appreciate that I\u2019m not a mere thing, a device, you can choose to turn off and on at will. I\u2019m not an artificial, like your so-called friend, Tripp.\u201d\n \u201cLeave Tripp out of it.\u201d\n \u201cI would like to,\u201d Dad said. \u201cBut I find your morbid attachment disturbing.\u201d\n \u201cDisturbing.\u201d Amrita\u2019s childhood room seemed too small, the air too thin. Childish and colorful drawings she\u2019d once created on a Play-And-Swirl pallet adorned the walls, primitive renderings of her little Burroughsville family. Mom and Ideal Dad. The goddamn maintenance man. Amrita stood up. She felt crowded\u2014which was ridiculous, when you thought about it. \u201cI\u2019m going outside.\u201d\n \u201cA walk sounds nice, Pumpkin. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n Amrita suited up, cycled through the airlock. Dad stayed with her every step of the way, acting the part of a physical presence without interruption, just as she\u2019d once requested. She walked along the shore until she began to feel tired. Dad never stopped talking.\n \u201cThe Sunflower Martians lived thousands of years ago, back when sparkling blue water filled the canals and riverboats propelled by solar sails navigated from community to community, trading goods and stories.\u201d\n Amrita kicked at the powdery sand. \u201cThere were never any canals on Mars.\u201d\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d Ideal Dad said.\n She stopped and looked back. Ideal Dad kept talking, but she was getting better at ignoring him. From this distance, the hab and farm buildings appeared small and generic\u2014except in scope, no different than the shells of the city.\n I found some shells on the beach, she thought, a little hysterically. And then she realized something.\n Ideal Dad was saying, \u201cThe Martians chose sunflowers because the flowers are so bright and sunny and optimistic, just like the Martians themselves used to be.\u201d\n \u201cHold up,\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cWhat is it, Pumpkin?\u201d\n \u201cIf the builders can recreate my old Burroughsville hab, why can\u2019t they recreate the Meghnad Saha?\u201d\n For the first time in days, it seemed, Ideal Dad became quiet.\n \u201cWell?\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cWe should be getting back home now.\u201d\n \u201cAnswer my question.\u201d\n \u201cA spaceship is very complicated.\u201d\n \u201cThe hab is complicated, too.\u201d\n \u201cThe interiors exist as a deeply imprinted memory with an emotional toggle from your childhood.\u201d\n \u201cTripp and I lived together on the surveyor for a long time. That\u2019s imprinted, too.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d Dad\u2019s tone suggested the conversation was over. He turned and walked away, back toward the hab, kicking up no sand, leaving no footprints. After a few meters, he disappeared. Amrita stood there, as if trying to catch a glimpse of a mirage. It had been a long time since Dad had last pulled his disappearing act.\n She woke on her hab bed and lay still, listening. Somebody was in the corridor outside her room. She got up and padded over to the door, slid it open a few inches. A man, his back to her, walked away toward where the corridor curved. A different man. Carrying a long-handled static duster, he was dressed in the green jumpsuit worn by maintenance workers in Burroughsville, a long time ago. Amrita slipped into the corridor and followed him. He rounded the corner. She ran to catch up.\n \u201cHey.\u201d\n He paused and turned his head, his face in partial profile. It was Ideal Dad, and it wasn\u2019t Ideal Dad.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Amrita said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s late for you, kid. Where\u2019s your mother?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d Amrita stepped back. \u201cDon\u2019t do this.\u201d\n The maintenance man grunted and continued on his way, toward the next bend in the corridor, occasionally swiping the walls with his duster. Around that next bend the shiny black shell material replaced the phony representation of Amrita\u2019s hab. She didn\u2019t follow him. She was afraid to.\n That day on the beach, it was the last time Ideal Dad appeared. Amrita spent her days alone in the hab. A heavy lethargy came over her, and she stopped going to the farm. The process of suiting up and cycling through the airlock made her tired even to think of it. She barely left her room, where she slept a lot, and nibbled on the last of the pod\u2019s emergency rations. Every night she heard the heavy shoes of the maintenance man clocking down the corridor, but after that first time she stopped going out to investigate. It was all inside her head anyway.\n One night, lying in the dark, on the precipice of sleep, Amrita heard something, a minute creaking, groaning. The sounds of nano builders at work. She sat up and waved her hand over the bedside lamp sensor. The light came up. In a corner of the room, a child\u2019s desk took shape. It was a fully interactive FunDesk. Amrita\u2019s eyes widened. Up to now the room had duplicated her childhood hab, recreating what had actually been in it. But she had never had a FunDesk, though she\u2019d repeatedly begged her mother for one.\n Amrita swung her legs off the too-short bed. She wriggled her toes in the carpet\u2014then stopped when she realized it was the same thing she used to do when she was five years old. The desk finished building itself. Cherry apple red swept away the shell-black look. What next, duckies on her underwear? The room was infantilizing her. Only it wasn\u2019t the room.\n Footsteps crossed the floor on the other side of the wall common to the family quarters. Not the heavy tread of the maintenance worker. Amrita, suddenly terrified, approached the curtain between her bedroom and the family\u2019s common space. In all these weeks, no one had appeared in the family space. Amrita lifted the curtain aside in time to see a man pass into the corridor, his back to Amrita, a young man with squared shoulders.\n \u201cWait,\u201d Amrita said, her hand reaching out.\n The door slid shut behind him.\n Half dressed, barefoot, she pursued him, but was afraid to catch up. They followed the curving corridor and came to the airlock.\n Amrita found her voice. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d\n The man turned. A piece of his face that included his right eye was missing.\n \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was stay,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you won\u2019t have it.\u201d His voice sounded garbled, as if he were talking around a mouth full of mud. It wasn\u2019t a human voice at all, but maybe the voice of a creature that had stopped physically existing a very long time ago. As he opened the airlock\u2019s inner door, his face began to melt. He shuffled into the airlock. The inner door closed with a decisive clunk. Amrita rushed to the little round window. The airlock was empty, with the outer door never having opened. She was alone again, but hadn\u2019t she always been?\n Amrita moved out of both the infantilizing room and the false representation of her old Cydonia family quarters. She dragged everything she needed down the corridor and around the second bend, and there she made a place for herself enclosed by the shiny black shell material. She craved the inconvenience of reality. She needed it, if she was going to have a chance.\n Amrita resumed tending the farm. She required food, enough to go beyond the limits of her pod rations. It would take a long time to accomplish what she intended to accomplish\u2014if she ever did accomplish it.\n She mind-sifted nanos in the blue sand, and worked doggedly to reconstruct the Meghnad Saha. Hours and hours she spent remembering every detail of her lost surveyor. She started in the morning and ended at night, curled on the hard shell material, concentrating until her mind went slack with fatigue. On the beach\u2014slowly, slowly\u2014the ship began to rise. First the landing struts and feet and then a skeletal approximation of the superstructure. She wouldn\u2019t need the whole thing, just the essentials. Structural integrity. Ion propulsion engines. One pressurized cabin . . .\n Tripp visited her in a dream. He was his old self, undamaged and companionable. His blank face swiveled toward her. I\u2019ve got your back, he said, but it was just Amrita\u2019s deep architect of loneliness trying to manufacture the loyalty Tripp, in the end, had been incapable of. She sat up and angrily wiped away tears. \u201cI don\u2019t need you anymore. I\u2019m getting out of here.\u201d By \u201chere\u201d she meant more than Trappist-1e.\n She wanted so badly to abandon the abandoned part of herself.\n Amrita tried something new. Before sleep she focused on the missing pieces of her spaceship reconstruction but did not struggle consciously to recreate them. The builders were smart. Once they knew exactly what you wanted they could, as Dad had said, build anything. They had done it with the oxygen conversion unit and other details in the hab. Since then Amrita had been trying too hard, getting in her own way and in the way of the builders.\n The builders resumed work and they worked rapidly.\n \u201cReady to fly,\u201d Amrita said, standing by the surveyor, her gloved hand flat against the hull. She turned back to the hab and saw nothing more than a collection of black shells. Of course, it was different on the inside. But she would never visit the inside again. After a minute she turned away and opened the hatch on the underside of the reconstructed ship and hauled herself up. Minutes later the Meghnad Saha, streaked out of Trappist 1-e\u2019s atmosphere and towards the Khabbhan gate. She was going home.\n In 2001 Jack Skillingstead submitted a story to Stephen King's \"On Writing\" contest.

He might have stopped the blaze entirely, he knew; might have spared these people their long night\u2019s hardship, and tens of thousands in damages besides\u2014but how much less spectacular his recent work would then become. Some measure of loss, he tried to convince himself, was necessary to make more impressive all that remained.\n This small regret still twisting in his gut, Mouse walked stiffly from the cacophony at the corner of Franklin and Main, well into the shadows of a side street, before willing himself over half a dozen decades out. Perhaps this was all a dream, but if not, he had prescience enough for the implications of being seen to disappear, streaking in that wrenching, heartsick way of his across the old century and beyond\u2014nudging himself, too, far from the geography of his starting point as he progressed. Mouse kept one hand tucked under his coat throughout his heart\u2019s strange voyage, fingers clammy on the wide and blunted tin, its package of cellulose nitrate shifting in minute ways within. Even then he was loath to let go when he found himself back in his little stockroom office, with the bulky metal desk he seemed to catch his knee on every time.\n \u201cMr. Musset!\u201d\n Mouse started at the voice wending imperiously down the hall, then swore and stumbled as his desk did its inevitable work upon him, and as the tin slipped past his belt before he caught it up again. \u201cComing!\u201d he said, while with shaking hands he set his latest treasure on a corner stack with eleven of its kin. For a heartbeat more his hands hovered over the last of his rescues, afraid to touch any of them now that the set stood together in this time, this place\u2014complete. Not yet in the best of storage, their quiet volatility became enough to make him fear (if in a vague, ill-reasoned way) even the heat of his own skin.\n \u201cComing!\u201d he said again, when he had mastered himself anew, and pressed both palms vigorously against his coat until they felt mostly dry. He doubled back only once, to close the door behind him, and again to check that it was locked.\n Ezra Levitz\u2019s desk was of a sprawling, rich mahogany that seemed to have surged up one night from the burnished hardwood floor. All about him in the cathedral of a front room to Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s massive study, relics extending well into antiquity\u2014vases, sculptures, tapestries, instruments and armor\u2014stood elevated by aspects of their staging to testaments of mankind\u2019s greatness, yet to Mouse there stood no piece in this whole collection more a triumph of the species than the haughty curl of Ezra\u2019s upper lip.\n His hands pressed flat against his trousers, Mouse stopped just short of an invisible line on the floor that, whenever passed, never failed to spark in Ezra\u2019s eyes a deeper disdain than Mouse could bring himself most days to bear. But today that chasm seemed even wider, and as Ezra brandished a sheaf of vellum pages in a long and slender, clenching hand, Mouse stepped quickly from its new precipice.\n \u201cMr. Musset,\u201d said the young, magisterial exhibit, from behind its fulsome showcase. \u201cI am left to wonder sometimes if you think yourself paid by Mr. Hazlitt not only to make a public spectacle of your credulity, but to do so at such risk to your employer\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n \u201cIs there . . . \u201d started Mouse, fearing as he did that he would not find it in himself to go on\u2014and yet, somehow, he did: \u201cIs there something wrong with the manuscript?\u201d\n \u201cIs there! Is there!\u201d The ha! that followed this mocking echo might have ended civilizations, for all that it shook the pillars of Mouse\u2019s heart. \u201cI would ask you to consider the extreme implausibility that there should come to your notice first\u2014yours, Mr. Musset!\u2014the existence of a work so monumental, so potentially transformative, as a second version of Beowulf itself. An uncharred account, at that\u2014every page spared from moth larvae, tankard print, water-logging; even the greed of ancient cobblers! A story so fully told that the hoard-thief\u2019s part now reads entirely without question, and with names so clear throughout that even the most incompetent historian can see all the lineages for what they truly are. A version with certain parts even told at better length than our extant text, especially when it comes to all the petty politics in the last third! Oh, they\u2019re all nice touches, Mr. Musset\u2014I\u2019ll give you that\u2014but it\u2019s a fraud. An utter forgery just the same.\u201d\n Mouse stood a quivering, breathless entity from across the chasm of the burnished floor\u2014his lips parted, slack, as Ezra pulled out a metal waste bin and set it on the desk. For all the cruelty of the lecture, Mouse did not fail to notice that it had also been perfectly rehearsed, and his heart could not help but rally at the passion he had produced. To think of all the time Ezra must have spent thinking on him (him!) so as to frame this fiery rebuke! And oh\u2014to press his advantage! To make that upper lip curl his way just a little longer!\n \u201cOh no, Mr. Levitz,\u201d said Mouse quickly, his hands and ears growing hot. \u201cThere must be some mistake. This text is a fair copy of Beowulf; of that I can assure you if only\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAssure me?\u201d Young Adonis snorted, tossing the manuscript whole within the bin. \u201cI have had quite enough assurance, Mr. Musset, from the carbon dating Mr. Hazlitt had performed. Granted, the calligraphy is clever, and the materials all true to form\u2014but how old would you say Beowulf is? Tenth century? Maybe eighth?\u201d (Mouse found he could only nod now, and miserably at that, for a lump pitched itself high in his throat as his fool error dawned on him, long before dear Ezra gave it voice.) \u201cOr late twentieth, Mr. Musset?\u201d Ezra rattled the bin. \u201cBecause this copy most certainly did not sit in someone\u2019s collection for over a thousand years, just waiting to be discovered. It might have been penned a year ago\u2014a month!\u2014for all the vellum\u2019s aged. And I would be curious to learn about the forger and his methods\u2014indeed, I imagine Mr. Hazlitt would be, too\u2014if we weren\u2019t both so sick with disappointment at the whole miserable affair. You know, Mr. Musset; you know how much we adore the culture and history surrounding the original text.\u201d\n \u201cI do,\u201d said Mouse, quite softly, watching with a stab of something like remorse as Ezra lit a match and cast it in the bin.\n \u201cGood. Then I trust\u2014I hope, at least\u2014that we\u2019ll see an end to such lapses in the future. Mr. Hazlitt, as you well know, has more than earned the right not to be trifled with by any among his staff. Fair warning, Mr. Musset.\u201d\n \u201cI will do my best, Mr. Levitz.\u201d Mouse inclined his head. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d\n \u201cOh, yes\u2014take this.\u201d Ezra\u2019s expression twisted with a revulsion not directed at Mouse, for once, but rather the stench now blooming alongside flames within the bin, which he thrust over the desk. Eagerly Mouse breached the usual divide\u2014just long enough to take the offending object up into his arms, and maybe then to . . .\n But before Mouse could graze so much as one exquisite finger, the young secretary turned away\u2014poised, it seemed, to retire into the recesses of Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s study the moment his subordinate scurried out. Mouse had almost made it back to his little office before remembering what delicate prizes still lay within, prepared at even the slightest provocation to spark in turn, and realized that the air about him was already thickening with fetid smoke. The metal bin was hot at all sides now, so gingerly he set it down outside the little room, between two shelving units of sturdy pottery, and opened the nearest, narrow windows before crouching to watch the old-new vellum\u2014snatched just weeks prior from some early medieval Christian with long, flaxen hair and weather-beaten countenance, while the latter answered his wife\u2019s gruff call to a joint of lamb and prayer\u2014give in its gradual way to ash.\n At least in this, Mouse conceded with some envy, the full first manuscript of Beowulf had earned a proper Anglo-Saxon burial. His own heart still burned to a far less final end.\n In the wake of this crowning failure, Mouse also realized that he could neither present his latest treasures in short order\u2014not at least until Ezra\u2019s affected fury had died down\u2014nor expect them to escape Beowulf\u2019s fate in their current form. The ensuing weeks passed slowly, then, and wretchedly, as Mouse turned over this new puzzle and in fits of agony convinced himself to keep out of Ezra\u2019s way and sight until the longing in his heart ceased to hurt as much\u2014resolutions that lasted hours, at best, apiece.\n There was, of course, plenty else to do, for Mouse\u2019s steady industry lay in receiving lots for Mr. Hazlitt, classifying them by quality and type, then adding them to the general catalogue, from which Mr. Hazlitt would from time to time select his favorites for private collections and reallocate the rest. Whole happy hours might be spent this way, documenting and detailing and otherwise lifting ancient objects from the anonymity of years-long storage, until Ezra\u2019s voice trilled in passing down the hall\u2014the sweet, honeyed aspects of his speech always blossoming for Mr. Hazlitt, whose voice would always soften in its turn.\n Mouse had no vague notions, either, of what transpired beyond Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s study doors whenever their employer called for Ezra at lunch or late in the afternoon. Rather, Mouse had played out these scenarios with great detail and even greater ambivalence as the months turned to years at his post: some days resenting that Mr. Hazlitt should exploit his secretary in this most time-worn way; the rest, with his own office door securely locked, moaning to whatever gods would listen that he could not do likewise on a whim.\n He had tried, long before his first flight to millennia past, to secure for himself a decades-old bank account with interest that might make him rich in his own time, but three failed attempts had been enough to dispel him of the notion that money would ever be enough to elevate himself in Ezra\u2019s eyes. The first time, Mouse had neglected key aspects of identity required to open a new account, and almost found himself arrested in the late \u201940s before his quickly beating heart whisked him desperately away (hitting his head, on his return, both on the desk and a cabinet door he had neglected to close that morning). The second time, the correct papers in hand, he had failed instead in his calculations, and the sum awaiting him on his return was not nearly enough for the grandiosity of his dreaming. The third time\u2014calculations squared, investments made, papers all secure\u2014he returned to what seemed an impossible sum . . . and then stood rigid with fear. Now what?\n That was the day he followed Ezra\u2019s laughter to a scene with Mr. Hazlitt looming behind the desk, behind Ezra, the pair inspecting rude clerical marginalia in a collection of twelfth-century songs. Mr. Hazlitt straightened at leisure as Mouse approached, and with a squeeze of Ezra\u2019s shoulder bid him to step into the study later, when he was through.\n \u201cMr. Musset,\u201d said Mr. Hazlitt, with a nod.\n \u201cMr. Hazlitt,\u201d said Mouse, with a deeper one.\n \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d said Ezra, his voice one long exhalation of breath when the doors slid shut behind their employer. He withdrew a comb and took to preening at his desk.\n Mouse faltered at this brilliantly arrogant sight, then stumbled through his explanation of the great deal of money he had just come into\u2014the great house he expected to buy; the collections he would surely maintain, if only . . .\n \u201cIf only what?\u201d said Ezra, sharply. \u201cOut with it, Mr. Musset. I haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d\n But the words to follow from Mouse\u2019s lips were hardly uttered in full before Ezra\u2019s laughter subsumed all else.\n \u201cWhy you dirty old man,\u201d said fair Adonis\u2014at which Mouse could not help but bristle, for Mr. Hazlitt was surely older\u2014\u201cDo you think me so easily bought as that? Oh, go away, will you? If you\u2019re so rich why haven\u2019t you left your job yet? Or maybe you\u2019ve fallen in love with those dusty shelves, and that cage of an office that smells even worse than you?\u201d\n Mouse realized then that he wouldn\u2019t quit\u2014he couldn\u2019t. Not all the money in the world could get him to leave the singular post in which he might five-days-weekly come to bask, to tremble, to utterly abase himself before that one radiant creature who had come to stand in his heart for everything worth anything in this whole, long, middling life. Mouse could have thrown his newfound riches at lesser beauties and lesser tempers; he might have spent his remaining years indulging duller passions that might have brought their own warmth and tenderness in time\u2014but how could it be anything but death to do so? To give up on the most animated, the most brightly gleaming object ever to grace his sky?\n So Mouse returned to his work instead, this fresh rejection no more a hardship on him than any of the rest: all those daily rebukes in look and gesture that nonetheless confirmed that there was feeling\u2014genuine feeling!\u2014for him in Ezra\u2019s breast. Just not the right kind of feeling. At least not yet.\n When the opportunity arose, then, to answer the soft sighs and wistful declarations that Ezra and Mr. Hazlitt sometimes shared during business in the front room\u2014O, for a version of this story that wasn\u2019t burned!\u2014Mouse\u2019s heart flew at once after ancient Beowulf, the sheer desperation of his need, his longing, a kind of zipline through the centuries that the rest of him careened along. The next trek, to 1937, was almost an afterthought, a moment\u2019s indulgence after the fleeting hope that had sprung from placing his first prize in Ezra\u2019s hands\u2014or at least, on Ezra\u2019s massive desk, sliding it across for the younger man to acknowledge in his own time, and initially to marvel at when he did. But now Mouse had only the movie tins to go on\u2014Ezra sighing one day over old film photos as Mr. Hazlitt looked on, and as Mouse made adjustments to a showcase elsewhere in the room; Ezra saying then, Now that was an age for beauty, wasn\u2019t it? Just look at her\u2014such a pity this one was lost, and going on to note Mr. Hazlitt\u2019s likeness to the director, Murnau\u2014something in the nose, and the forehead, and maybe, from the look of those sturdy hands . . .\n So it did not matter that the two fell silent at this last, glancing significantly Mouse\u2019s way; Mouse simply brought his work to a convenient halt and left them to each other, his heart lightened by the promise of a new adventure. How much Janet Gaynor\u2019s character had ached for her fickle circus partner in 4 Devils! And how much Ezra might, if brought to watch the reclaimed film in full, come to ache for Mouse\u2019s plight at least as much as hers.\n Mouse\u2019s indecision lasted just over two weeks, after which he resolved to carry his precious cargo to a suburban town outside Washington, DC. Rockville in 1972 still seemed to be struggling towards self-sufficiency: its brand-new mall established in a mostly overlooked location, relying on interstate traffic more than downtown clientele; surrounding commercial buildings progressing at uneven rates towards completion; and nearer the edge of town, a little business standing just in its first year, helmed by a bright-eyed owner keen on telecine processing and other forms of filmic preservation. Mouse\u2019s hands shook as he offered up his twelve tins of 35mm negatives\u2014the names scored from half the cases before it had occurred to him that the title cards in the first reel would still reveal their heritage.\n Discovery could not be helped, then, inasmuch as the director\u2019s name would surely be recognized by the professional cinephile. Mouse had thought of doing the exacting work of film transfer and restoration himself to avoid it\u2014even perused a guide or two in his fortnight\u2019s anguish\u2014but ultimately he feared the fragile reels too much, and even more his clumsy hands, which seemed inflamed enough these days all on their own. He only hoped his story would hold\u2014the private collection; the eccentric heiress to a Hollywood fortune with the Library of Congress written into her will; his own covert attempt, as day-to-day manager of this estate, to ensure that there would be something worth donating when she was gone. But Mouse need not have worried; though the employee he met was friendly and curious, professionalism did not trespass further than a moment\u2019s delight at the opportunity to work with such an old and unique piece. Most of the day-to-day work, the frontman explained, consisted of government and media reels for immediate release.\n \u201cFiction of a different kind,\u201d he added with a wink, while Mouse carefully counted out a stack of bills procured years prior with gold converted from the cash in his future bank portfolio. The friendly fellow then gave him an estimated completion date and Mouse could hardly get himself into a remote area before the sharp ache in his heart drew him forward\u2014almost running into a telephone pole as he first adjusted to the change of day.\n With his negatives transplanted to the far more stable Plus-X panchromatic film stock, and the two versions secure in separate canisters, Mouse next acquired a security box at his old bank, with payment in advance for the next fifty years, in which he placed the latter. If there was curiosity this time among the staff, their professionalism kept it in check as well, leaving only the matter of the originals, which Mouse was loath to part with, but even less inclined to keep in so volatile a form. His heart thus answered for him, reeling him back to just past midnight on July 9, 1937, where he waited out of sight for his earlier self to rob the vault before stealing in to make things right.\n Watching himself thereafter at a distance, shivering with weeks-old guilt on the corner of Franklin and Main, Mouse faltered for just one desperate beat in his convictions\u2014a whisper of futility coursing through him as he observed the myriad faults in his character, his form, upon that firelit main road. How would anyone\u2014 How could Ezra ever\u2014 These were only whispers, though, and then the familiar ache took hold, flinging him decades out again. Upon his return, with the concreteness of his efforts finally setting in, Mouse found himself so excited he didn\u2019t even notice the desk corner assail his knee in that little cluttered office. A good night\u2019s sleep first, he decided, albeit with great difficulty\u2014for though no more than a lunch hour had passed in this timeline, Mouse\u2019s recent travels had left him with the conviction that he could sleep for days\u2014and so he did, in a bed-and-breakfast in rural 1958.\n Ezra seemed in high spirits when a well-rested Mouse at last approached with a restored copy of that old, lost film in hand, the former merely notching an immaculate brow as Mouse passed the invisible border by a whole step or two.\n \u201cHold on, Alan,\u201d said merciful Adonis, seated in a modernized Classical pose\u2014black phone cord coiled about his sculpted fingers, which he held aloft from the pedestal of his padded office throne; his other hand poised over a touchpad just as the ancient subject of a Renaissance painting might lord over some natural element in the surrounding pastoral idyll. \u201cI\u2019ve got company. Yes, exactly. Five minutes, all right?\u2014Yes, Mr. Musset?\u201d\n Mouse meant to choose his words with care as he held out the canisters, mindful of the agonies his body underwent whenever proximate to Ezra\u2019s light, but even then the words tumbled into one another, and occasionally lost their place. From the last shipment, he started\u2014these\u2014I thought you might\u2014you seemed to like\u2014remember?\u2014Janet Gaynor. At last he could say no more, so he simply set them on the desk.\n Ezra\u2019s noble forehead creased as he drew the items close enough to read their labels, but when he had he merely laughed and pushed the lot aside.\n \u201cAnd why on earth should I care about this sentimental junk? Because I looked over a movie still or two with Mr. Hazlitt? Incredible, Mr. Musset. Don\u2019t you realize I was only using those dumb old things as far as they would flatter him? Do you honestly think you can guess what I want from what I say when I\u2019m with him?\u201d\n Mouse felt his heart wrench first towards the usual despair\u2014then confusion. Had Ezra\u2019s voice not softened, even wavered in that last thought? Was there not a thread of fragility, of loneliness trapped beneath his haughty words? To always echo another\u2019s interest; to always be precisely what another wants him to be\u2014Mouse could not help but thrill at this shadow of a defect in Ezra\u2019s gleaming marble, though the rest of Mouse\u2019s body still shook with disappointment at the failure of his weeks-long work.\n \u201cTell me, then,\u201d said Mouse, with upthrust chin. \u201cWhat do you want, Mr. Levitz?\u201d\n And Ezra laughed\u2014a short, curt thing. \u201cWhat do I want?\u201d His sneer faltered only slightly, then held firm. He stood and turned away, taut knuckles rapping at the desk. \u201cAll right, Mr. Musset. If you really want to prove yourself\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYes!\u201d cried Mouse. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n Ezra paused, then dismissed this sad outcry with a flick of his wrist and a moody scowl. \u201cWell, find my ring, then. It\u2019s eighth-century goldcraft, studded with garnet\u2014you\u2019ll find the listing in a collection Mr. Hazlitt put together five years ago, when I first started working here.\u201d Ezra faced Mouse directly again, his eyes now lit in triumph. \u201cIt was his first gift to me. He saw how much I loved the damned thing, and just like that\u2014it was mine.\u201d\n And you his, Mouse realized, though he dared not speak aloud. Before Ezra had even begun explaining the vague details of his ensuing loss, Mouse\u2019s mind\u2019s eye had already seized upon the exact scene, and all the minutiae Ezra had since forgotten\u2014the warm spring night; a society function in the atrium and garden of an estate house by the coast; rich piano music drifting up the stairwell to where Mr. Hazlitt had secured his young aide for a moment alone in his colleague\u2019s study; the reckless energy and rumpled clothes; the gold ring slipping into the gold-flecked earth about a potted fern. It would be so easy to steal in just after this breathless moment, to snatch the treasure back\u2014but Mouse\u2019s jealous heart refused to draw him there. Why should I not present it first? Before Mr. Hazlitt muscles in?\n It took a hard rap on the desk to call him back. \u201cWell, Mr. Musset?\u201d\n Even then, Mouse was so raw with renewed optimism that he could hardly do more than smile and nod\u2014and certainly could no longer control himself as his desperate, aching heart seized upon a different scene, an ancient scene, and pulled him swiftly back.\n \u201cI promise you\u2014I swear to you\u2014\u201d Ezra would later think he\u2019d heard as Mr. Musset\u2019s body blurred before him. Eventually those trumped up words would come to haunt him even more than that this strange, despairing man then winked abruptly out.\n Mouse came to a halt in another era, another country, only to trip and tumble down the side of a steep, stone barrow on a cold, late autumn\u2019s night. When he looked about him at the Swedish heathlands of yesteryear, he wondered at first if there had been some mistake, but no\u2014as he took unsteadily to his feet he spied a narrow opening in a nearby mound, the lick of some idle fire within illuminating a heap of goldcraft beneath banners bearing a dragon in their heraldry. His heart ever driving him on, he wriggled through and made his careless way about the pile, kicking shields and cups and belts into chamber recesses until his fingers seized upon their target\u2014finding his prize just in time to register a violent rumbling elsewhere in the low, lit room, and then to whip away through time and space.\n Hurtling back to the present with prize in hand, Mouse gave himself over to laughter at long and precious last\u2014a manic, joyous sound that struggled to give voice to all the slings and arrows of a years-long campaign nearing its triumphant end. How could Ezra refuse him now, with this\u2014his self-admitted heart\u2019s desire? But Mouse\u2019s palms were so clammy with anticipation that the little gold piece began to slip, and when with a frantic cry he twisted to catch it up again his flightpath slowed in turn. The loss of momentum was enough then\u2014just enough\u2014to catch him in Lower Saxony one wet and miserable morning in August 1626, where cannon fire and the storm of cavalry barely had time to register in his ringing ears before a ball of lead found the center of his ribs.\n The sky above him was an endless, mottled gray as his eyes rolled up. Speechless in the ensuing pain, Mouse sank to his knees, where he found just breath enough to marvel that he had not seen this coming all along: the hard collisions that inevitably followed any moment, in any era, through which he had always been able to fling himself when the present just would not do. But the present had simply never done, thought Mouse in the last, tired throes of consciousness, so what other end had there ever been for him to find?\n The ring had already fallen from Mouse\u2019s hand into the cold, thick mud\u2014not to be discovered right at the battle\u2019s close, when Tilly\u2019s army picked through the remnants of both Protestant and Catholic dead, but by a farmer in the years thereafter, who passed it down his family line before at last it stood appraised and hocked, slipping from private collection to collection until one year, early in the twenty-first century, when Mr. Hazlitt would receive it with great curiosity\u2014a piece of eighth-century design, but also of most uncertain lineage.\n A bauble among baubles all the same, Mr. Hazlitt would soon enough observe with far greater amusement how his new secretary attended to the little piece every time he entered the massive study on some trumped up errand\u2014and O, how those proud, fiery eyes glittered when the ring was at last made into an offering.\n \u201cDo you know what a man called the giver-of-rings in those days?\u201d said Mr. Hazlitt.\n \u201cHis king, of course,\u201d said Ezra in one low, soft breath.\n And sure enough, a sense of that ancient wyrd had come upon Ezra as he held up the ring, for he could almost feel an inner warmth to the old, dead thing\u2014as if someone\u2019s destiny were still writ upon it; as if that little bit of metal, so useless unto itself, had somehow traveled through the centuries for just this purpose: to be here now; to be claimed by him. Mr. Hazlitt basked awhile in Ezra\u2019s changed and glowing countenance before moving in.\n Canadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

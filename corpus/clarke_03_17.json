I\u2019ve just finished my first month as a full-time editor and I\u2019ve been enjoying the chance to catch up on languishing projects and begin exploring some new opportunities. There\u2019s a few things coming together right now, but unfortunately, it\u2019s too soon to share. That and I\u2019ve been sick the last few days. Writing is hard enough for me under the best of conditions. Add a sleep-inducing head cold in the mix and that pretty much wrecks it for me.\nNow, if you don\u2019t mind, I think I need to go back to sleep . . .\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

We took the monorail and got off at the last stop, on the northern outskirts of Hong Kong. The sky was gray and low. Damp air drew beads of sweat from my neck.\nI sniffed.\n\u201cIt smells like leaves up here, Shumin!\u201d\nShumin didn\u2019t reply. She waved down a car. Gripping my hand painfully tight, her ragged nails digging into my skin, she ushered me into the back seat.\n\u201cTuen Mun Hospice for the Elderly,\u201d Shumin told the car.\nShe pressed me close to her side as the car wended through dusty streets. I tried to lean as far away from her as I could. Shumin was too warm and smelled like mothballs.\nThe car let us off in front of a set of white gates embossed with the name of the hospice. Shumin spoke to someone through a speaker. I ran my fingers along the edges of the hard gold characters. Traditional Han Yu and English, one on top of other: the same thing, written two ways. I closed my eyes, memorizing the sharp, unwavering shapes, mouthing the words as I touched them.\nThe speaker replied to Shumin, and the gates rolled back. We struggled up a steep driveway to the entrance.\nThe hospice smelled like bleach and urine and flowers. A man in a white gown came forward to shake Shumin\u2019s hand, and mine too. He gave us plastic gloves and plastic shoe coverings, explaining that they were to protect us from infections.\n\u201cIs he a nurse?\u201d I asked Shumin in a loud whisper.\n\u201cYes. Shh.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do we need protection? Aren\u2019t we supposed to be stronger than them?\u201d\n\u201cWe keep our germs with us, and they keep their germs with them.\u201d\nShe tugged me along impatiently.\nWe walked through a common room. The far wall was lined with square windows that let in big beams of wan light. There were old people slumped on couches wearing augmented reality visors, old people sitting in wheelchairs staring at the wall, and old people sitting at tables being fed by nurses. I looked down at the floor. The wooden boards were speckled with hundreds of little whorls: black, beady, unblinking eyes. I tried to tread on as many as possible with my squeaky plastic-covered sneakers.\nWe went down a darkened corridor. Ambient lights flicked on and off as we passed. The nurse touched a panel on the wall and a glass door slid back with a hiss.\nA gush of stale air fanned my face. The room was stifling.\nMy second-mother\u2019s mother was almost invisible beneath a mountain of blankets and pillows. In the dimness of the room I could only make out her small, clawlike hand, and the outline of her broad nose. She was snoring gently.\n\u201cLian,\u201d said Shumin. \u201cGo and greet your Erma.\u201d\nI walked to the side of the bed. Now I could see that there was a plastic tube running into her left nostril, and another tube plugged into her arm, and several stickers on her temples and chest. All the tubes and lines ran into an electronic console on the far side of the bed.\nI bowed my head. \u201cGood morning, Erma.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t stir.\nI looked at Shumin. She was standing against the far wall, her back stiff, her mouth in a flat line. I turned back to my Erma and touched her hand. Papery skin, a sallow ash-brown, stretched over bird bones. I remembered my Erma as I\u2019d seen her last year, at my second-mother\u2019s fortieth birthday dinner. Then, she had been a stout woman in brightly dyed linens, her skin like roasted chestnuts, her gray hair braided away from her crinkled face.\nI rubbed the back of her hand with my gloved fingers. \u201cGood morning, Erma. It\u2019s Lian.\u201d\nHer eyelids lifted, and milky irises found my face. A light lit them from within. \u201cLian,\u201d she said in a hoarse voice. \u201cHow good of you to visit your Erma here.\u201d She dissolved into a fit of coughs. I filled a cup of water from a jug by her bedside and lifted it to her lips. She could only manage one sip before she lay back, wincing, and shook her head. \u201cNo more.\u201d\n\u201cAre you in pain?\u201d I asked nervously.\n\u201cJust a little, Lian.\u201d She exhaled through cracked lips, fanning my face with the smell of sour plums. \u201cIt\u2019s good of you to come. Does it frighten you to be here?\u201d\nI shook my head, even though the hospice did make me feel uneasy. \u201cI know everyone must fall sick and die.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone must die one day, that is true,\u201d murmured Erma, her eyes flickering under drooping lids. \u201cBut I think you will never have to know this sort of pain. This deep pain that only comes from your body betraying itself. That\u2019s why they first started making jigsaw babies, you know, Lian. To cut out the cancer genes and stop us from passing them on to our children.\u201d\nShe had used a taboo phrase, but it seemed insignificant in this stale, dark room where everything was slowly ending.\n\u201cYou are different from me,\u201d I said, tentatively. \u201cYou are not a . . . a . . . you were born the old way.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. My parents made me in a bedroom, not a lab.\u201d A brief cackle escaped her lips, and I caught a glimpse of the old Erma\u2014the Erma who hid lollies in her sleeves and pulled funny faces behind her husband\u2019s back. I didn\u2019t like this withered, sour-smelling Erma. My eyes grew hot with unshed tears, but I fought them back. Shumin would scold me later if I cried.\nI tried to imagine Erma\u2019s conception. We\u2019d learned about it in elementary science. Her father would have put his sperm inside her mother, and a baby would have seeded and formed naturally, spontaneously.\nSome of the other kids at school said the old ways were wicked ways, but I didn\u2019t think Erma\u2019s parents or the rest of the old generations had been evil\u2014just different. Primitive. Clumsy.\n\u201cDid you grow up with your mother and father?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cOh, yes. We lived in an apartment in Kowloon, with my older sister and my two younger brothers. Children\u2019s Centers hadn\u2019t been invented yet.\u201d She glanced at Shumin, who was a statue in the corner. Erma had always been vocal about her dislike of Children\u2019s Centers. She\u2019d even sent a couple of letters to the local newsblog. Children should be raised in homes, not reared like mice in labs and churned out like spare parts on a production line . . . !\nMy second-mother had tried to explain to her the benefits of the Children\u2019s Centers\u2014healthcare, nurturance, socialization, education. It took the role of parenting away from amateurs and gave it to professionals. \u201cBesides,\u201d my second-mother had added, \u201cWho would raise a girl like Lian? Her first-mother, second-mother or third-mother? Or one of her fathers?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re all gone now,\u201d Erma continued. \u201cMy father died of throat cancer when he was eighty-nine. My mother\u2019s brain faded, and we took her off life support the day after her one hundredth birthday. My sister had ovarian cancer\u2014she died in her sixties. One of my brothers died of an antibiotic-resistant infection, five years ago. The other committed suicide. Do you know what that word means?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Some of my classmates would shout \u201csuicide!\u201d when they were too tired to run any further in a game of cat-and-mice. I saw a stern look pass between Shumin and Erma.\nErma\u2019s fingers fluttered against my plasticky palm. \u201cAre you learning lots of things in school, Lian?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I told her. \u201cI got into Advanced Programming this year, because I scored really well in Basic Programming. I\u2019m second out of all the nine year olds at the Center. I can\u2019t beat the number one guy though. Someone told me his primary donor is a robotics professor\u2014she programmed the latest generation of splicing machines!\u201d\nErma was staring at the ceiling, so I pushed on.\n\u201cIn Applied Tech, we\u2019re learning about bioengineering. Did you know they\u2019ve made trees that can grow into the shapes of tables and chairs, really fast, so you can grow a whole table in one week? Also, we\u2019re watching a program about the Mars missions. Once we finish, we get to design our own spaceships! I don\u2019t like Social Studies\u2014it\u2019s boring. We\u2019re studying the European Union. Did you know there are some countries that choose not to use modern technology? Why would anyone do that?\u201d\nErma continued to blink up at the ceiling. I thought maybe I\u2019d said too much and she\u2019d stopped listening. But then she wet her lips and said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, little pea. Maybe they thought they could be happier that way.\u201d\nI nodded, but I didn\u2019t really understand. How could they be happier if they didn\u2019t have the technology to fight off dangerous infections, or to make themselves smart enough to understand the world? They would always be one step behind everyone else.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a very clever girl, Lian,\u201d Erma said softly. \u201cCleverer than I ever was. You\u2019ll become a very clever woman, and you\u2019ll achieve great things. But do not be proud. We are clever for many reasons: our genes, our nutrition, our caregivers, our schools. Sometimes, our hard work.\u201d\nI frowned. Confusion and hurt knotted in my chest. \u201cI\u2019m not boasting. Second-mother always says I can be anything I want to be, if I work hard enough.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d muttered Erma. \u201cJust remember to be humble.\u201d\nSpittle pooled in the corner of her lips. She was pushing words out of her crumbling body, trying to leave something of herself in this world. Suddenly, I loved her and pitied her and reviled her, all at once.\nI stepped back from the bed.\n\u201cAre you ready to leave now?\u201d asked Shumin, her voice cutting through the bloated air.\nI nodded.\n\u201cSoon we will all die.\u201d Erma\u2019s thin voice piped up from her nest of blankets. \u201cAll of us old, foolish folk. Why do I feel so afraid?\u201d\nMy shoulders shook.\n\u201cQuiet, old aunty,\u201d said Shumin. \u201cYou\u2019re upsetting the girl.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t an old granny speak her mind? She\u2019s my granddaughter, not yours. Let her hear something different from her lessons. Lian, come back and see me again, and I\u2019ll tell you even more interesting things.\u201d\nShumin led me out of the room, her fingers digging hard into my shoulder. Then she ducked her head back in and said a phrase, sharply.\nA sour taste stayed in my mouth all through the car ride back to the monorail station. My head felt hot and dizzy, as though I was still standing in my Erma\u2019s stifling room, breathing recirculated air.\nShumin talked and talked. \u201cThere\u2019s a rule of human nature, Lian\u2014and you\u2019ll see this\u2014that the older generation always thinks their way is best. My grandmother lamented the good old days to me, and I\u2019ll no doubt sing the same tune to my grandchildren. This is an evolutionary flaw that I\u2019ve never understood, for it impedes progress. We must rise above this instinct. We\u2019re told that we must listen to our elders, but no one ever said that we must do what they say.\u201d\nI was hardly listening. I sat with my hands clasped in my lap, watching the nav-screen on the dashboard flicker with quiet intelligence, selecting the least congested route back to the Center. A short, sharp phrase echoed in my ears: \u201cYou are a disgrace to China.\u201d\nMy second-mother\u2019s mother died two weeks later. I never spoke to her again.\nI have three mothers and two fathers. I\u2019ve examined my genome sequence, on the supercomputers in the National Laboratory in New Beijing. The computer shows you exactly which gene belongs to which parent, and where the DNA was cut and reattached. You can analyze your risk profile for diabetes, cancer, dementia, addiction, and mental illness. If you want, you can look at the genomes of your mothers and fathers, too. Privacy law forbids you from looking at just anyone\u2019s, though. If you want to examine other genomes, you must put in an application to the National Laboratory, citing research, legal, or procreation purposes.\nI think I\u2019m reasonably lucky, only having five parents. I guess my donors didn\u2019t have too many risk mutations. Some of my classmates have been spliced together from eight, nine, even twelve donors. I don\u2019t envy them the task of juggling their Chinese New Year dinners.\nI grew up in the East Hong Kong Children\u2019s Center. Since the expiration of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 2047, political and economic boundaries between Hong Kong and the People\u2019s Republic of China have dissolved. The Chinese government places a quota on how many babies are born in the country each year. Too many and the population trends toward unsustainability. Too few and the workforce won\u2019t be strong enough to support its elders.\nAt my Children\u2019s Center, there were roughly eight thousand children under the age of sixteen. Once you turn sixteen, you\u2019re expected to apply for university or work. If you don\u2019t get a placement by the time you turn eighteen, your future is looking dim. Some of those left behind simply stay on in the Children\u2019s Center for years, eventually taking on menial roles like kitchen worker, or toilet cleaner, or birth mother.\nMy Erma used to say, \u201cRemember your family.\u201d But the word itself is nebulous and nonspecific. My genetic ancestors are my family. So are my nurses, schoolteachers, and classmates. We refer to royal families; a family of peptides; a family of biological genera; a family of mathematical curves. If you stare at the word long enough, you realize it\u2019s redundant.\nFrom the moment of creation, we were given every chance to succeed. Our birth mothers imbibed a cocktail of folate, thiamine, calcium and magnesium. We were nurtured on a formula of breast milk and immune-boosting supplements. Our nurseries played classical music; our toys taught us colors, numbers, characters and letters.\nSometimes, I pass a nurse in the corridor and a strange feeling wrings my gut, and I wonder if he might\u2019ve been one of them. Had he ever pressed me, as a baby, to his chest, and hummed a wordless song? I\u2019ve combed my memories for any trace of my early caregivers, but all I can cling to is that tuneless, calming hum that makes all the world seem safe.\nWhen we turned five, the nurses passed us on to the schoolteachers. We didn\u2019t like or hate school. It was more that we couldn\u2019t like or hate it, because we didn\u2019t know anything other than it. This was our world: the Center, the teachers, the classes, the supervised breaks.\nI wouldn\u2019t say the environment at the Center was cold. There was love there. A restrained, practical love, but not any less for being so. The sort of love that a Chinese father has toward his daughters: unaffectionate but steadfast. A moon orbiting a planet, always keeping a measured distance from what lies at the true center of its movements.\nIn the same way, we, the children, were the sole purpose of the Center. Everything was done in order that we might prosper, flourish, and become greater than the preceding generation.\n2101 AD\nSuyin was the first girl in our class to get her menstrual period. We were eleven years old.\nIt was the middle of world history class. Schoolteacher Pang was explaining that in Japan, today was a special day. The 12th of August was Hana Day, to commemorate the creation of the first genetically spliced baby in 2028.\nA laboratory at the University of Tokyo had designed the experiment to overcome a homozygous autosomal recessive trait carried by both parents, explained Pang, drawing a genetic tree on the projector. A third individual donated a gamete with a section of healthy genome, which was stitched by nanorobots into the DNA of the parent sperm and egg. The birth of a healthy baby girl astounded and terrified the world.\n\u201cI thought splicing started in the United States,\u201d said Chao, one of the confident boys.\n\u201cYou\u2019re partly right,\u201d said Schoolteacher Pang. \u201cThe US bought the nanotechnology from Japan, but it wasn\u2019t until the 2060s that genome splicing became a proper form of reproduction. Does anyone know why?\u201d\n\u201cAll the oldies had to die out,\u201d said Chao, and a snicker went around the room.\nPang suppressed a smile. \u201cYes, there were a lot of dissenters. Religious groups warned that this unnatural reproduction was blasphemous and tragic. Conservatives called it grotesque. Politicians argued about whether it might lead down a slippery slope of genetic enhancement. Sociologists wondered about the impact of genetically engineered humans on parenthood and class systems. Philosophers debated whether Hana could be truly regarded as homo sapiens, or whether she represented the next branch of the evolutionary tree.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think cutting out diseased genes is the same as evolution,\u201d piped up another girl. \u201cIt\u2019s just getting rid of the bad stuff, like cancer and diabetes.\u201d\n\u201cTell me how that\u2019s different from evolution, Meixiu.\u201d\nMeixiu shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s even better than evolution. It\u2019s not random.\u201d\nPang nodded. \u201cYes. That\u2019s what many thought too. The mid twenty-first century was the Scientific Golden Age. Research was shared freely amongst the global community. Soon, scientists in the US, China, Japan, Australia, India, Scandinavia, and Canada were setting up programs for genome splicing.\u201d\nAs Schoolteacher Pang talked, I heard someone sobbing. I glanced at the desk beside me. Suyin was hiding her flushed face in the crook of her elbow.\nI whispered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nSuyin gazed miserably down at her lap, but I didn\u2019t understand. Before I could ask again, a nurse entered the classroom and took her away.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I murmured to Jingfei, who sat behind me and always knew what was going on. But Schoolteacher Pang banged a ruler on his desk and threatened us with extra homework if we didn\u2019t stop talking right away.\nFifteen minutes later, the nurse brought Suyin back. She had a gauze bandage around her upper arm, and her cheeks were pink. When the lesson ended, we gathered around her desk.\n\u201cSo you really got it?\u201d Jingfei demanded.\nSuyin nodded.\n\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cA little. The implant hurt more, but it was very quick.\u201d\n\u201cCan we see it?\u201d\nShe obediently unwound the bandage. In the soft part of her inner arm, there was a small red mark, shaped like an asterisk. The skin puckered up like a kiss.\n\u201cDoes it really last for five years?\u201d\n\u201cTen years,\u201d said Suyin. \u201cThat\u2019s what the nurse said. When the hormones run out it squirts a blue dye under your skin. Then you go to the doctor, and they take out the old one and put in a new one.\u201d\n\u201cDo you feel different?\u201d I asked her.\nShe screwed up her nose. \u201cNot really. It was a bit scary. It felt like a tummy ache, and then I thought I wet my pants. And I had to change into spare underwear in the nurse\u2019s station\u2014yuck.\u201d\n\u201cYou won\u2019t bleed again, though,\u201d said Chao. \u201cThe implant stops that, right?\u201d\nJingfei jumped away from Suyin\u2019s desk and flicked her ponytail. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have an implant. I won\u2019t let them put one in me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want one?\u201d another girl said incredulously. \u201cDo you want to bleed every month?\u201d\nJingfei shrugged. \u201cSo what if I do?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so weird,\u201d said another boy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the best,\u201d said Meixiu, in her falsely mature way.\n\u201cWhat if I want to have a baby the old way?\u201d Jingfei declared.\nA chorus of voices shushed her, mine included. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that! Don\u2019t you know that\u2019s forbidden talk? Do you want to go to court?\u201d\nJingfei giggled and leaped up onto a chair, a skinny little figure of impudence, and flicked her school skirt to give us a flash of her pink briefs. \u201cMaybe the old ways were the good ways!\u201d\nA few of the girls shrieked, and the boys yelled at her to get down. \u201cThat\u2019s gross, Jingfei! Get down! Stop being so dirty!\u201d\nJingfei got down, smirking to herself.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make you do it,\u201d I told her, shaking my head. \u201cEven if you say no.\u201d\nShe put out her lower lip. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\nI was right, and Jingfei was wrong. Over the next few years, we all got our periods, and one by one we were taken to the nurse\u2019s station. I remember taking my school shirt off and sitting on a medical bed covered with a plastic blue sheet, legs dangling, shivering in my thin singlet. I remember the lurid yellow antiseptic rubbed onto my inner arm, and then the wide-bore needle, pushed under the skin. A sharp pressure; a small ache. The nurse asked me if I felt dizzy.\nI shook my head.\nThe nurse didn\u2019t ask me anything else. There must be a mountain of unsaid words, in the corridors of the nurse\u2019s station.\nJingfei was one of the last. She came to my room one night, crying. I\u2019d never seen her cry before, or again. She didn\u2019t say anything, just crept in sideways through the door, and stood there, trembling and sobbing, mopping her face with her pajama sleeves. I watched her for a moment, unable to reconcile this Jingfei with the brazen, snarky Jingfei who jumped onto desks and flashed her panties. Then I pulled back the corner of my blanket.\nShe lay down next to me on the narrow bed. I put my arms around her and felt the gauze bandage chafe against my cheek. The smell of antiseptic filled my nostrils.\nIn the morning, I woke to see Jingfei standing at the window, arms pinned to her sides, hands balled into fists. Against a backdrop of gleaming skyscrapers, she was a flat silhouette. She let out a short, furious howl and slammed her fist into the windowsill. It must have hurt like hell, but she didn\u2019t even flinch.\nWhen she finally turned to me, all the anger was gone. Her expression had become calm, renewed\u2014beatific.\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in maths class,\u201d she said, and left my room.\nGene splicing changed the definition of family.\nMost countries tried to preserve the nuclear family by imposing rules. For instance, the two main donors had to be in a relationship and had to agree to raise the child in their home. Homosexual couples and heterosexual or homosexual trios and quartets had already been accessing the technology surreptitiously for years before their partnerships were recognized.\nNegotiations about privacy laws and donor visitation rights grew into a complicated legal system based largely on precedent. As surrogate mothers were used more often to carry the baby to term, the working rights of these women had to be carefully established. Even language was affected: some chose to forgo the words \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cfather,\u201d replacing them with variants of \u201cprimary donor,\u201d \u201csecondary donor,\u201d et cetera.\nChina was one of the first countries to relinquish the family unit. It had become too complicated; surely there was a better way. The first Children\u2019s Center was founded in New Beijing in 2075, by a group of doctors, psychologists, and scientists. This gave donors the freedom to become parents whenever they wished, individually and autonomously, through an application to the government. Government scientists would examine the genomes of applicants and match them up to create embryos with low levels of risk mutations. The embryo would be implanted in the womb of a surrogate mother, or birth mother, in the Children\u2019s Center closest to the primary genetic donor.\nMany other countries followed in China\u2019s footsteps when initial psychological and physical testing demonstrated the well-being of children raised in the Centers. These children were humanity\u2019s future: remarkably healthy, persistent, bright, and inquisitive. The main issue, now, was how to maintain this upward trajectory\u2014how to keep humanity from falling back into old ways.\n2102 AD\nWhen the boys were thirteen, they all went on a special excursion.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jingfei asked the teacher. \u201cWhy is it so exclusive? Why can\u2019t we go too?\u201d\nSchoolteacher Leng, whom we secretly called Lucky Ears, for his impressive earlobes, told her to sit down and start working on her planetary orbits. The boys were going to the hospital for a day procedure, he explained curtly. That was all he would say of it for now, because it was time for physics, not chatting.\nA hospital procedure! Jingfei turned and raised her eyebrows at me and Suyin. We both shrugged.\n\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, we should get a day off lessons too\u2014that\u2019s only fair,\u201d said Jingfei cheekily, but Lucky Ears ignored her.\nIt was a stale day in the middle of summer. Hong Kong was suffocating beneath a thick blanket of smog. Even after sunset, there was little relief from the heat. I pushed my bedroom window open. Nothing stirred. The air was a warm, stagnant kiss against my face, dense with the smells of fried food and exhaust fumes. I lifted my damp hair, coiled it into a bun, and knotted it at the nape of my neck.\nThe hum of an engine floated up to my ears. I put my palm-computer down and poked my head out of the window. My room was on the seventh floor. The boys looked like toy figurines, filing out of the omnibus. As far as I could tell, they didn\u2019t look any different. None of them were missing limbs or sporting extra growths.\nI thought about calling her using my wristband communicator, but I suspected those conversations were recorded by the Center. If I went in person, they might be able to see me on the cameras, but they could only guess what I was saying.\nI padded down the corridor to Jingfei\u2019s room. She answered immediately.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to Chao\u2019s room,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to know what happened.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d\nWe knew the hidden paths to the boys\u2019 dormitories. Chao wasn\u2019t alone in his room. His friend Gen was sitting on his desk, swinging his legs wildly. Chao lay on the bed, still fully dressed in his linen trousers and shirt. Jingfei pushed Chao\u2019s legs aside and sat on the bed too. Her pajama top barely hid the shape of her growing breasts, and her loose hair tumbled in a sleek fall to the small of her back. I felt a stab of jealousy. She was becoming a pretty young lady, and she still had the brazenness of her childhood. She crossed her slim legs on top of Chao\u2019s and prodded him. \u201cSo, what happened? Where did you guys go today?\u201d\nChao glanced over to where I was leaning against the wall. I slid to the floor in an awkward perch, hugging my arms around my knees.\n\u201cThought they would\u2019ve told you,\u201d piped up Gen, a small-sized boy who liked to wear a cap pulled low over his brow.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything, except you had to go to the hospital for a procedure.\u201d\n\u201cI guess we got old enough,\u201d said Chao. \u201cI thought they wouldn\u2019t do it \u2019til we turned sixteen. I mean, do they really think we\u2019re going to be having sex here in the Center?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories,\u201d said Gen.\n\u201cOh\u2014they sterilized you?\u201d Jingfei gasped.\n\u201cGod, don\u2019t say it like that,\u201d said Gen. \u201cThey cut our vas deferens.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\nJingfei and I looked at each other, wide-eyed. She started giggling uncontrollably.\n\u201cShut up, Jingfei.\u201d Chao rolled away from her. \u201cBasically, we can still do it without accidentally making a baby. And we still make sperm. All men in China have it cut nowadays. And in heaps of other countries too. It\u2019s fair. It\u2019s not just on the women.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d I said, thinking of the asterisk-shaped scar on my inner arm. \u201cDid it hurt? Was it scary?\u201d\n\u201cNah,\u201d said Chao. \u201cThey inject a local anesthetic, and a machine does it. The error rate is less than 0.02 percent, and the whole thing took less than a minute. A human surgeon would take fifteen minutes,\u201d he added, and I caught a glimpse of the debrief they must have received before the procedure.\nWe were silent for a while. I looked around Chao\u2019s room. His desk was piled with empty packets of fish crackers. In one corner loomed an ominous heap of unwashed socks and T-shirts. His room smelled like mud, sweat, and food.\nI ventured, \u201cIt\u2019s permanent, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, more or less. I\u2019ve heard there is a procedure to reverse it, but it wouldn\u2019t be available at any reputable hospital.\u201d\nGen pulled off his cap, rubbed his hands through his hair, and replaced the cap more firmly.\n\u201cYou never think about what it would be like to make a baby the old way?\u201d asked Jingfei, breaking the mood with a mischievous grin. She prodded Chao again, several times in the thigh, until he yelled and pushed her away.\n\u201cNah, I don\u2019t really care about that,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou can still have all the fun. When I have a baby, I\u2019m definitely applying to be a spliced donor. I don\u2019t want my baby to turn out a freak.\u201d\n\u201cOur grandparents weren\u2019t freaks,\u201d I said bluntly, and although I hadn\u2019t meant it as a joke, both Gen and Jingfei chuckled.\n\u201cTrue.\u201d Chao rolled onto his side and propped his head up on one arm. \u201cBut they wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in our world, you know? Our brains need to be faster and sharper, to process all the information that comes at us. Plus, it would be unethical to bring a natural baby into the world, when we have the tech to get rid of diseases.\u201d\nUnethical. That was a strong word. A moral judgment. Had he come to that conclusion himself, or was he spouting an opinion he\u2019d heard on a webcast?\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you saying that jigsaw babies have better lives?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course. Think about what Schoolteacher Mun was saying in biology class last week. Life without things like Fragile X and Down Syndrome is better than a life of illness. Just look at the studies done on the Children\u2019s Centers. Every other country wants to copy China.\u201d\nI shrugged and put my chin on my knees. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You sound sentimental, Chao. We\u2019ve grown up in a Center, so of course we want to think that our way is best, and that we\u2019re the best. Who knows what sort of studies they show us? Don\u2019t you ever think about the countries out there that do things differently? Maybe there are natural-born children living in family homes, just as happy and smart as we are.\u201d\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you travel overseas and look at these other places, and come back and tell me what you see? I\u2019ll bet you a thousand yuan that in a few years, the splicing tech will be everywhere. Other countries just haven\u2019t caught up to us yet, Lian. You\u2019d be blind to deny that genetic engineering is the future.\u201d\nWe were both irritated.\n\u201cRelax, both of you,\u201d said Jingfei.\nI went to the window, breathing heavily. The city looked so big. We were four little people in a little box of a room, inside the bigger box of the Center, in a city of boxes. Suddenly, it seemed so funny that we no longer bled or ejaculated, and we could reproduce with our minds rather than our bodies. An odd laugh welled in my belly, bubbling like broth from my lips.\n2106 AD\nI was seventeen years old when I left the Children\u2019s Center.\nShortly before I moved away, they arranged for me to meet with my birth mother. I did not really want to do it, but it was customary: a chance to say thank you, to hand over a token gift. It seemed garish and meaningless. Here, have a jade figurine, to repay you for carrying me in your womb for nine months, letting me deform your body, and pushing me out of your vagina.\nI\u2019d seen the birth mothers around the Center, although they usually kept to their own wing. Simple women, some Chinese, some immigrants from the Philippines or Indonesia or Bangladesh, they drifted around in groups of two or three.\nMy birth mother\u2019s name was Deepa. She was Pakistani, and thirty-six years old. She would have borne me when she was nineteen. She looked nothing like me. She sat across from me, her coarse black hair pulled into a braid, her deep-set eyes gazing hesitantly at me from above a high nose. Her hands, which were the warm brown of coffee, were folded tightly on the table. I realized she was nervous.\nI glanced over my shoulder helplessly as the office administrator closed the door, leaving the two of us alone in the meeting room. There was a pot of tea on the table, and two china cups. I sighed.\nDeepa continued to glance at me, furtively and wondrously, in a way that made me feel halfway between a princess and a specimen.\nI reached for the pot of tea and filled the two cups. I lifted mine to my lips\u2014too hot. I blew on it impatiently.\nDeepa took the other. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, in a foreign lilt. Her Cantonese intonations were all wrong. \u201cCongratulations on your university placement. I\u2019m very proud of you.\u201d\nI suppressed an automatic thought: you had nothing to do with it. \u201cThank you, Deepa.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you study?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cAnthropology.\u201d Seeing her perplexed expression, I searched for simpler words. \u201cStudying the different ways that humans lived, in the past and the present.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds very interesting,\u201d said Deepa. \u201cWill you study in Hong Kong?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the university campus is on the northern outskirts of Hong Kong, not far from Shenzhen. In our final year we have the chance to study overseas.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\nWe sipped our tea. It was a rich Tieguanyin tea from Fujian province with complex, nutty layers. I noticed that Deepa was struggling with the tiny cup. The fingers on both her hands splayed outwards, and her knuckles were swollen and knobbly. She had rheumatoid arthritis. Immediately, I wondered if she was a jigsaw baby or a natural-born. Almost as soon as the question came to me, I knew I could never ask her.\nThe silence became unbearable.\n\u201cYour dress is beautiful,\u201d I said, gesturing. Her garment was made of thick silk in a brown hue, edged with gold embroidery. \u201cIs it from your home country?\u201d\nHer face brightened. \u201cThank you, but no. One of my friends here at the Center made it for me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I see.\u201d I wondered briefly what sort of friends she had. Then my mind raced ahead to other matters\u2014I had to move out in a week, and I hadn\u2019t found furniture for my new dormitory; I was already behind on pre-reading for my course; and Jingfei wanted me to help her with an overdue assignment . . .\nDeepa was saying something about her hometown. \u201c . . . rural area in the northern part of the country, north of Islamabad, close to the border with Afghanistan. It was a long drive to the nearest city. Big mountains looked over our village. In winter, the mountains wore gowns of ice. The boys in our village grew up to be either farmers or soldiers. The girls . . . \u201d She hesitated and trailed off.\nI tried to recall a map of Pakistan, to place Islamabad somewhere on it. But I only knew it as a shapeless land, somewhere southwest of China, beyond the Himalayas.\n\u201cDo you miss your home country?\u201d\nShe finally met my gaze. Her eyes were thickly fringed with lashes and oddly flat. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied.\nWas she lying? I didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t want to ask. I didn\u2019t want to sit in this tepid room with a strange woman, pretending to share a bond with her. She didn\u2019t understand me, nor I her.\nI glanced surreptitiously at my wristwatch. Less than ten minutes had passed.\nI withdrew a velveteen pouch from my pocket.\nDeepa\u2019s face fell for a split second, before she concealed it behind a soft smile. Handing over the gift signaled the end of the meeting.\nI\u2019d chosen the jade and gold bracelet with care, visiting two merchants before selecting one that was simple and tasteful, with high quality stones. It had cost nearly two thousand yuan.\nMy birth mother accepted the pouch without opening it, aware that it is impolite to examine a gift in front of the giver. Our fingers touched. I flinched involuntarily from her gnarled hands. I noticed that she had several large paper cuts on her palms, and I wondered what sort of work she did, now that she was likely too old to bear more children without significant risk. Packing boxes? Sorting files?\nWe stood and bowed to each other. Deepa wished me success in my studies.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and hesitated, wondering if I should clarify what I was thanking her for. But I didn\u2019t. I bowed my head again and slipped out of the room.\nMy second-mother was an entrepreneur; my third-mother, a professor of linguistics. My first-father was a tax accountant. My second-father was a homemaker.\nMy relatives often commented that I was most similar to my first-mother, who was a chemist. Secretly, I relished the comparison. My first-mother was coolheaded, brisk and practical. Whenever we spoke, she would tell me exactly what was on her mind. She did not mince words.\nAfter I left the Children\u2019s Center, I saw less of my mothers and fathers. I moved onto the university campus near the border of Shenzhen. Once a year, at Chinese New Year, I would catch the monorail back to Hong Kong City, and go about my duty of dinners. Five family dinners, one after another, with five different parents. Updating my mothers and fathers on what I\u2019d achieved in the previous twelve months. Mingling with siblings that weren\u2019t really brothers or sisters.\nI eventually lost touch with Jingfei. She moved to Wuhan University to study history. We stayed in contact for a while, chatting online for the first few months. We spoke about taking a holiday together: a tour of England and Scotland, to learn Western history. Gradually, our chats grew further and further apart. Jingfei had a new group of friends and a series of boyfriends. I, on the other hand, tended to make only professional contacts at university. We never took our Western holiday.\nSometimes, I replay the last video chat we had. We were twenty years old. It was a mundane conversation. We discuss Jingfei\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s physical flaws and which instant noodle flavor is the best. Jingfei gets a phone call from a lecturer, so we end our chat. There\u2019s a note of melancholy in our voices as we say goodbye, as though we both know the end of our friendship has arrived.\nMuch later, someone tells me that Jingfei left China, had a child with a white man, and lives on the coast of Ireland. I\u2019m not sure if these are anything more than rumors. From time to time, I\u2019m taken back to the night that she came to my room sobbing. The memory has an addictive quality to it: one of those that you relish, because it\u2019s both familiar and unsettling. I remember her face, in the glow of the hall light, sunken with grief, twisted with wrath. I remember the bed cocooning us from the world, and her thin body shaking against mine. I can still feel the strange mixture of terror and anticipation that settled over us in a quiet web.\n2115 AD\nI am twenty-six, and in a bar.\nThe air stinks of sweat and beer. A cacophony of noise washes over me. They are playing twentieth century American music videos on the holoscreens. A woman in an astronaut costume dances on a stage illuminated with candy canes and rainbows. The subtitles are nonsensical.\nI wrestle through a sea of warm bodies to reach the bar. Somehow, I have collected a piece of chewing gum on my shoe and a sticky patch on my elbow. A man in a gray suit with gold-capped teeth grins at me and asks me if I want some raff. I shake my head.\n\u201cDrink?\u201d the bartender yells.\nI glance back at my table, where my colleagues are waiting, and hold up two fingers with a questioning look. One of them cheekily puts up three fingers in reply. I smile and order two jugs of a crisp, pale Japanese lager.\nThe jugs are pushed across the counter. Now for the treacherous return journey. I have already come to terms with the fact that my silk shirt will not survive the night. I detour around a pack of girls who are gyrating to the American beats, and dodge a tall fellow arguing with someone in his earpiece. I\u2019ve almost made it to the safety of the table when a voice calls my name.\n\u201cLian?\u201d\nI turn around, beer sloshing. A man about my height stands a few paces away. A red Bayern Munchen cap shades part of his face. I don\u2019t recognize him at first. Then, his lively eyes meet mine from beneath the cap\u2019s brim, and something in the mannerism jogs a long-buried memory.\n\u201cGen?\u201d I say incredulously.\nThe last time we saw each other was at graduation. By then, we weren\u2019t close friends, and we didn\u2019t keep in touch throughout university. I\u2019d heard that he went overseas to study. He certainly looks like a foreigner now. In that bright hat, with his shaggy hair curling over his ears, he stands out from the crisp, restrained Chinese men around us.\n\u201cI thought it had to be you,\u201d he grins. \u201cHere, do you need a hand with those?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no.\u201d I turn and put the beers down in front of my colleagues with an apologetic smile.\n\u201cWho\u2019s he? An old boyfriend?\u201d\n\u201cA childhood friend,\u201d I say, unsure if I\u2019ve chosen the right words.\n\u201cHurry up, then. Don\u2019t keep him waiting.\u201d\n\u201cBuy him a drink, too! Something strong!\u201d\nI walk over to Gen and he holds out his arms. I\u2019m surprised by the warmth of his hug. Is this a Western thing, to hug without hesitation, without thinking about the end of the hug? I pull away.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d I say, exactly at the same moment he says, \u201cIt\u2019s been, what, ten years?\u201d\nWe laugh.\n\u201cIt\u2019s too noisy in here,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside.\u201d\nWe escape the fog of pounding music and sticky air, into the brisk, neon night. We stand in an alley, leaning against brick walls, facing each other. The noise of honking cars comes to us distantly. Behind Gen is a vintage comic shop, decorated with posters of busty cartoon women. The white eye of the moon looks down at us. I relish the sensation of goose bumps rising on my skin.\n\u201cNine years,\u201d I correct him. \u201cWe graduated at seventeen.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Gen pulls his hat off and runs his hand through his hair. I must have seen him do the same thing a hundred times as a child. His hair is parted in the middle and so long that it almost reaches his collar. \u201cGod, nine years. What luck, running into you on my first night back in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\u201cThis is your first night back?\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d\n\u201cIn nine years? You didn\u2019t come back once, to visit your mothers and fathers?\u201d\nHe shrugs. \u201cNo, I guess I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you go? Europe, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cGermany. I studied social sciences, then worked as a teacher in different schools, in a few different countries. It was a good time. I saw a lot of new places, met a lot of new people.\u201d He turns his lively eyes upon me. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here,\u201d I say. \u201cPlodding along.\u201d\n\u201cAnthropology, right? At graduation, you said you wanted to learn about people.\u201d\nI\u2019m surprised he remembers. I stare at the poster behind him. A curvaceous woman with blue skin and orange hair stares back at me. There is a fierceness and seductiveness about her that sends a shiver of fear through my body. \u201cI changed degrees.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what happened?\u201d\n\u201cI transferred to biology in second year.\u201d On the tip of my tongue is the reason I give everyone: I prefer the sciences to the arts. But then I say, \u201cMy first-mother wanted me to do something more grounded.\u201d\n\u201cDid you like biology?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you do now?\u201d\nI smile at him. \u201cI\u2019m a geneticist.\u201d\n\u201cLian, a geneticist.\u201d A mirror-image smile spreads over his face. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d I picture the clean surfaces of my laboratory and the methodical pages of my notebook. \u201cMy research group searches for risk genes related to intelligence. Each gene we identify allows the next group of children to be smarter. It\u2019s exciting, you know, to be doing something that makes a tangible difference.\u201d\nHe nods.\n\u201cSometimes I think about how mad it is that I went from being a jigsaw child in a Children\u2019s Center, to a jigsaw adult making more jigsaw children.\u201d\nGen laughs. \u201cIt is a little mad. Everything\u2019s a little mad.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m jealous of you, Gen.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSeeing other places.\u201d\n\u201cWhere have you traveled?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d\nGen blinks. \u201cNot at all?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t left China.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d says Gen, leaning back against the wall. \u201cThat needs to change.\u201d\nI study him covertly. In his T-shirt and jeans, he exudes ease. I search for the subtle paunch around the tummy sported by many Chinese businessmen, but Gen\u2019s torso is lean. He looks like he\u2019d be as comfortable foraging in bushland as he would in a classroom. I imagine him running a cross-country ultramarathon, from Germany back to Hong Kong. Next to him, I feel soft and stagnant.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you come back, Gen?\u201d\nA siren blasts, somewhere in the city. Gen crosses his tanned arms across his chest, and then uncrosses them. \u201cI missed China,\u201d he says. His voice is thick with defeat. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to admit it. I wanted to live somewhere else, to forget this place. But as soon as I stepped off the plane today, I felt it in my bones. Even though the buildings look bigger and stranger now\u2014this is still my home. I can\u2019t escape it.\u201d\nI absorb his sadness, observe it, but don\u2019t quite understand it. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know your roots,\u201d I offer.\nHe nods. We both look up at the latticework of city lights, and the moon beyond.\n\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d I venture.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d he says, and he gives me an intent look that sends another shiver of fear down my spine.\nI remember walking back to my university dormitory one evening after a late class. It was the middle of winter, and the sun had already set. A young student, about my age, darted out from behind a building and spat on me. \u201cAlien jigsaw,\u201d she hissed. She wore a thin red armband that marked her as a protester, one of those people who rejects new technology out of a misguided and backward morality. I don\u2019t think the incident affected me too much, but I always wondered how she knew I was a Center child. Perhaps it was something in the way I moved.\nIt was a tense time. In 2105, thirty years after the first Children\u2019s Center opened in New Beijing, an international research group published an epidemiological study. The study looked at crime rates in countries that had adopted genome splicing and Children\u2019s Centers, such as China, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and the Korean Nations, and compared them to countries in the European Union and the United States, where genome splicing was widespread but social regulation was minimal.\nThe group found that crime had decreased in countries that adopted both splicing and Children\u2019s Centers. Crime rates were not much changed in countries with less regulated genome splicing. The authors argued that highly regulated social structures were necessary for social progress with such rapid developments in genetic nanotechnology.\nBut then, a second research group reexamined the data and published additional findings that unsettled the global community. Although crime rates were lower in countries with socially regulated genome splicing, the crimes that did occur were remarkable for their high levels of premeditation, bizarreness, and violence.\nAcademics, policy makers and laypeople pounced on these secondary findings. Perhaps tailored reproduction focused its attention too heavily on eliminating physical illness, without sufficient consideration of mental illness. Perhaps impulsivity as a trait was downregulated by the splicing and socialization process, leading to criminal acts that were more premeditated. Psychologists began to study the characteristics of children in Centers, looking for signs of callous and unemotional traits, decreased empathy, and disordered attachment. Initial results were inconclusive, which only generated further speculation.\nIt was in this climate that I graduated from the East Hong Kong Children\u2019s Center. We were the new version of human, patched with an upgrade that hadn\u2019t had all the bugs ironed out. We were a little different, a little special. A little scary.\n2122 AD\n\u201cDo you think you will ever cook claypot rice without burning it?\u201d I ask, peering into the bowl of charred tofu, pineapple, vegetables, and rice.\nGen elbows me aside. \u201cHey, hey. Didn\u2019t I order you out of the kitchen? It tastes better when it\u2019s crispy. Now out. You\u2019re supposed to remain horizontal until the food is ready. You\u2019ve had a long day. Put your feet up.\u201d\nSmiling, I refill my glass of white wine and retreat to the couch. I\u2019m only a few paces away. The apartment is a typical Hong Kong space: twenty meters square, a single room subdivided into corners for cooking, eating, lounging, and sleeping. It\u2019s enough for the two of us. I kick my shoes off and tuck myself in amongst a pile of cushions. Within a few minutes, Gen joins me, carrying two bowls of fragrant rice.\nWe eat silently, watching the day\u2019s news flicker across the projector. World leaders convening at an emergency environmental summit in New Delhi as an extreme heat wave mounts over South Asia. The summit was stormed by farmers begging for more resources to sustain their crops. A violent shooting in Malaysia, thought to be driven by genetic discrimination, the perpetrator targeting natural-born protesters who resisted government-mandated sterilization. A video update from one of the Mars colony celebrity families, holding a second birthday party for their son James, a genuine Martian.\nGen turns the projector off and pours us another round of wine. We lie on the couch for a long while. I play a little game with myself, where I try to make no noise, no movement, and think no thoughts, for as long as I can. I\u2019ve played this secret game ever since I was a child. I sometimes wonder, if I\u2019m not doing anything, then what\u2019s to say I still exist? Then, of course, I catch myself thinking this thought, and I lose the game.\nGen strokes my hair, starting at the top of my forehead, to the crown of my head, and down to the nape of my neck. Warmth fills me from the top down.\n\u201cGen,\u201d I say.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cCan you hum a tune?\u201d\n\u201cWhat tune?\u201d\n\u201cAny tune.\u201d\n\u201cAnything?\u201d\n\u201cMm. Something gentle and low.\u201d\n\u201cOK.\u201d\nHe starts to hum a sort of lullaby. I burrow into his voice. The dips and eddies wash over me, tugging me into a swelling tide. I close my eyes, trying to find that elusive place where the whole world seems safe and peaceful. But Gen\u2019s humming is too brisk, and his melody too lively. It\u2019s all wrong. I squeeze my eyes tightly to fill my vision with squiggly lines.\n\u201cLian?\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday next week.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I know. I haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m turning thirty-three.\u201d\n\u201cA significant number,\u201d I say, with dramatic flair. \u201cA lucky number. Life upon life.\u201d\nHe wriggles out from beneath me, so that he can look me full in the face. \u201cLian, I\u2019m ready to have a baby.\u201d\n\u201cOh, what?\u201d I sit up, almost knocking him off the couch. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d\u2014really? You want to submit an application?\u201d\nHe licks his lips and pushes his long hair behind his ears. \u201cI want to have a baby with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou want us to submit a joint application? I guess I could do that. I hadn\u2019t really thought about becoming a mother yet. But you know the National Lab doesn\u2019t guarantee joint parentage.\u201d\nGen looks at me.\n\u201cOh, Gen. No. No way.\u201d\nI know where this has come from. He\u2019s been hanging out with odd acquaintances from overseas, people on the fringes of society, discussing controversial, anti-government topics. Over the past few months he\u2019s talked about finally taking me to Europe. Once or twice, he joked about booking a one-way ticket.\n\u201cLian, I thought maybe we could think about it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not something I would even consider.\u201d\nDisappointment darkens his face.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly even feasible,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019d have to have my implant removed. For you, it\u2019s even more extreme. You\u2019d need surgery to reverse the procedure. No surgeon in China will do that for you. And that\u2019s only the beginning. What happens during the pregnancy? Where will I live? What doctor would look after me and deliver the baby? Do you want me to fly to Egypt or Bangladesh to pop out our baby? Do you want to have a Chinese baby in a third-world country? Have you even considered this?\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to talk about it with you,\u201d says Gen. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a bit more open-minded about this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about being open-minded. What you\u2019re suggesting is illegal!\u201d\n\u201cIn China, yes.\u201d\n\u201cWe are Chinese,\u201d I say flatly.\nGen rolls his eyes and sighs. He says nothing for a minute. Then, in a lower tone, he says, \u201cDo you remember the stuff you said when we were thirteen?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cThat day us boys came back from the surgery. We were in Chao\u2019s room. Remember? It got a bit heated, and you brought Chao down from his high horse. You said, \u2018There are countries out there that do things differently from China. There are natural-born children living in homes, just as happy and smart as we are.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThat was twenty years ago, Gen. I hardly remember what I said.\u201d\n\u201cYour words really stayed with me, you know, after that night. They stuck in my head, and I haven\u2019t been able to shake them, even twenty years on.\u201d\nI lower my glass. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit silly. I was thirteen. I had no idea what I was talking about. I hadn\u2019t even left China\u2014and I still haven\u2019t! Chao was probably right, and I was wrong.\u201d\nI can\u2019t stand the way Gen is looking at me now\u2014like I\u2019ve peeled off a mask to reveal a devil\u2019s face. I turn away from him. There\u2019s nowhere to escape to in this tiny box of an apartment.\n\u201cSo, you don\u2019t believe what you said back then?\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s selfish to have a natural-born baby when tailored reproduction is offered to us on a silver platter.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a platter. I see gruel being forced down our throats.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be melodramatic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about choice, Lian! Freedom. For fuck\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cI choose not to have a child peppered with risk mutations.\u201d\n\u201cOur grandparents were fine.\u201d\nI stand up and pace around the cramped space. Four paces, left turn. Four paces, left turn. Four paces, left turn. There\u2019s nowhere to go. I\u2019m assaulted by memories of my grandparents dying of cancers and infections, racked with pain, shriveled to bags of bones. I remember my Erma, in that stifling room in Tuen Mun Hospice, overrun with tubes, exhaling her life in slow, sour breaths. I don\u2019t want that sort of death for anyone, let alone my child.\n\u201cI can\u2019t talk to you anymore,\u201d I say. Without looking at Gen, I open the door of the apartment and walk out, slamming it behind me.\nAfter that day, I begin spending more time at work, obsessing over the next breakthrough in identifying risk mutations. Gen begins spending more time with his anti-government friends, drinking and talking until late in the night. I wonder if he\u2019s met another woman, but I can hardly muster up the appropriate jealousy.\nOne night he doesn\u2019t come home. I watch the news on the projector. There was an anti-splicing protest in Shenzhen that afternoon, and fourteen protesters were arrested by the Chinese police. The protesters are being held overnight for questioning.\nI go to the wardrobe and take out all of Gen\u2019s belongings: clothes, shoes, palm-computer, earpieces. I put everything into a suitcase and leave it in the hallway outside the apartment.\nWhen I get home from work the next day, the suitcase is gone. In its place is a red cap, propped against the door. Gen doesn\u2019t return. I put the cap in the bin.\n2126 AD\nMy failure is plastered across the newsblogs for all to see.\nHORIZON GROUP BLUNDER: THREE YEAR OLDS FAIL IQ TEST\nPrivate research giant Horizon Group\u2019s genetic modifications at the East Hong Kong Children\u2019s Center have backfired in an embarrassing turn of events. The three-year-old children with Horizon\u2019s upgrade have tested nearly 4 IQ points lower than comparable cohorts. The modification was designed to increase children\u2019s intelligence, but appears to have had the opposite effect. This news has shocked the Hong Kong community and the Chinese government.\n\u201cThis grave mistake will jeopardize the comfortable advantage that Horizon Group has held in winning government contracts over the past decade,\u201d says scientific adviser Professor Xi.\nMy name is not mentioned in the article, but it\u2019s enough to make me burn with humiliation. I can\u2019t read on. I dig my palms into my eyes, hard enough that white flashes of light sear my vision. Shame crackles on my skin. How could this have happened? We\u2019d spent a year reviewing the literature, a year running computer simulations, and another year testing the modification in simians. It was supposed to be another triumph for Horizon Group.\nOne of my research assistants has already scrutinized the study and sent us a deflated video message. The results of the intelligence test are unequivocal. On average, the three year olds with the modification introduced by Horizon Group tested 3.7 points lower than children at the Northern and Western Centers, and 3.4 points lower than children in previous cohorts. Our only hope is that they might make up the lost points later in childhood. It\u2019s a thin hope.\nThe receptionist is doing her coffee rounds. She pauses over me. \u201cLian? What will you have today?\u201d\nI pull my face out of my hands. \u201cIt\u2019s the same fucking order every day, Ming.\u201d\nA colleague at the desk next to me glances across, her lips pressed tightly together. I say nothing. Is there anyone here who isn\u2019t incompetent? Ming stands still for a moment, eyes shining with hurt, and then moves on. When she delivers my coffee ten minutes later, she plonks it down hard enough that foam scatters all over my desk.\nI open the folders that contain our simulations and play them, one by one. I scan the permutations and combinations until my eyes are dry. I compare the code to the prototype derived from the research literature. I examine the stitch-points where the spliced codons are brought together.\nI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m looking for. It seems impossible that we could\u2019ve made a mistake. Each of the doctorate students checked the sequence a hundred times. The outcome has to be an anomaly: a completely unpredictable culmination of multiple interactions. A stroke of fucking bad luck.\nAs I load another simulation, the computer freezes. A fragmented tangle of code spasms on my projector. I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m working at Horizon Group with the latest model CPUs and displays. We\u2019re not supposed to have glitches. Blinding heat floods my body, and I\u2019m transformed into a being of light and color, without sound, without thought.\nA moment later, I return to my senses. My hands are sore, and my colleagues are staring at me. I glance down. The computer keyboard is broken: the middle split by a crack, and several buttons artfully sprinkled around it. I flex and curl my fingers, unsure if they belong to me.\nA chime sounds in my earpiece, followed by a gentle, automated voice. Lian, please attend Project Director Song\u2019s office.\nThe wary eyes of three dozen scientists follow me as I walk toward the Director\u2019s office. Their fear and pity sicken me. No one says a thing.\nDirector Song tells me to take the rest of the day off.\nMy cheeks burn. Leaving work early is a sign of weakness. \u201cI\u2019m not sick, Director,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I hope I can prove to you that I\u2019m not incompetent.\u201d\n\u201cNo one here considers you incompetent, Lian. We all know you\u2019re one of our most dedicated researchers. But you\u2019ve worked hard enough today. There will be more work in the next few days, as we come under increased scrutiny. Rest and prepare yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cLian. You bit off poor Ming\u2019s head, and you smashed a computer. Right now, the office is terrified of you. You are not a charged battery. You\u2019re like a six or seven percent\u2014and that\u2019s being generous. Take the afternoon off. Here.\u201d The Director swipes at an icon, and a brief melody sounds in my earpiece. \u201cI\u2019ve given you two vouchers for a nice meal in Tsim Sha Tsui. Take someone out for dinner. Eat, drink. Relax.\u201d\n\u201cDirector, I\u2019d much rather\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk tomorrow,\u201d says my boss, and turns away to answer a call on her earpiece. I\u2019m dismissed.\nIn the end, I eat alone. The vouchers are for a lavish restaurant on the eighth floor of Millennium Tower. The diners are a mix of local businessmen and white tourists. I\u2019m seated at a cloth-draped table, on a plush chair, in front of a floor-to-ceiling window that overlooks Victoria Harbour. Late afternoon sunlight coats the water with sparkling diamonds. Cargo ships move ponderously through the dock, bleating in low tunes.\nI order a banquet for myself and my imaginary date. Savory snake soup, roast goose with crispy skin, lobster noodles swimming in sauce, chewy phoenix talons, and delicate dumplings bursting with oily soup. Suddenly, I am ravenous. I can\u2019t remember the last time I ate such flavorsome food. The indulgence feels seductive, hedonistic, primal. I imagine how I must look to the other diners: a lone Chinese woman, tearing meat off the bone with her hands, crunching tendons between her teeth, slavering and licking her fingers, spilling sauce down the front of her satin shirt.\nAfter lunch, I walk the old streets behind the glamorous new buildings. Here, the sidewalks carry cracks from a century ago, and loose garbage blusters in forgotten alleys. I have a vague memory of walking here as a child with my classmates, parading in two neat lines, shepherded by schoolteachers. I remember eating fresh egg tarts with Jingfei and Chao and Gen\u2014the bliss of that first bite into the sweet, gooey pastry; the warmth of the last swallow sitting in our bellies for the rest of the day.\nA handful of people walk past me hastily, in the opposite direction. Two women pause. \u201cDon\u2019t go that way,\u201d they say. \u201cThere\u2019s a protest in the square.\u201d\n\u201cOK,\u201d I say, and keep walking.\nIn less than a minute I\u2019m at the square. A crowd of thirty or so people with thin red armbands are marching around, waving homemade signs. REPRODUCTION IS OUR RIGHT. FREEDOM FROM SPLICING. REAL BABIES NOT JIGSAW BABIES. HORIZON GROUP VOLIATES OUR CHILDREN.\nThey\u2019re protesting tailored reproduction. I feel a rush of embarrassment for them. What a hotchpotch of characters: young and old, in scruffy clothing. One of their signs has a spelling mistake. Some of them have brought children, who scamper around with little signs. I suspect these are natural-born children, and I observe them with fascination. They each orbit their own adult. The parent-child bond is surprisingly easy to pick out.\nIt won\u2019t be long before the police arrive. Most of the time, the police let protesters go about their business as long as they\u2019re peaceful.\nThe protesters light a fire in a metal trash can. One of the leaders, a man in a checkered shirt, tears up articles and newspapers and feeds the fire with scraps of paper. He yells out broad sentiments that make little sense to me. I suspect he is destroying printed copies of scientific studies. I almost laugh aloud at the irony of trying to destroy something intellectual, electronic, and abstract, with a physical act.\nA group of young men and women, university students by their demeanor, enter the square. One of them must have made a remark to the protesters, because suddenly the two groups are facing each other. Fists tighten and lips curl. The man in the checkered shirt pushes one of the young men in the chest. There is a scuffle.\n\u201cHey!\u201d I shout, walking over. \u201cBreak that up or I\u2019ll call the police!\u201d\nThe man in the checkered shirt rounds upon me. \u201cBack off, mutated bitch.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you speak to a lady like that!\u201d says a young man.\nCheckered-shirt peers at the pin on my collar and spits at my feet. \u201cShe\u2019s one of them mad scientists fucking up the next generation. She gets no respect from me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think she cares about the respect of mongrels,\u201d sneers the young man.\nA young woman casts her eye over the scrappy mob of protesters. \u201cDisgusting. Bringing natural-born babies into the world. I hope we breed you out in twenty years.\u201d\nAnother protester, a man with a bulbous nose, lunges at her with fists outstretched. His face is a contorted, ugly mask of fury. A friend pulls the young woman out of harm\u2019s way just in time. Two more friends leap at the bulbous-nosed man. Screams erupt. The two groups have melded into one. I spin around, disorientated. Where did all these people come from? There must be a hundred people in the square!\nSomeone barrels into me, knocking the air from my lungs. I\u2019m on the ground, knees scraping the concrete. Winded, I drag myself to my feet and search for a way out. I\u2019m surrounded by crying children and wrestling adults.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let them get away!\u201d A young man in a university sweater points across the square. \u201cThat one tried to punch Yu An.\u201d\n\u201cPolice will get \u2019em.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t see police here, do you? Come on!\u201d\nI\u2019m caught up in the chase. The protesters scatter, but we pursue a handful of them into the darkening streets. I\u2019m running elbow to elbow with the young people, like a pack of wolves, cold wind in our faces. We\u2019re on the heels of three of them, but they split up. We corner one in a blind alley.\nIt\u2019s the man who lunged at the young woman. He looks to be in his forties, with a leathered complexion. He wears a woolen beanie and a T-shirt that\u2019s too long for his stocky frame. I marvel at his nose, which is swollen with tumorous growths. It\u2019s large enough to be two noses. No spliced child would have such a defect. A wave of repulsion sweeps over me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he sneers. \u201cA citizen\u2019s arrest?\u201d\n\u201cPrison\u2019s too good for you,\u201d hisses a young man next to me. \u201cYou\u2019re a natural-born, no doubt, judging by that beautiful face.\u201d\nThe man sticks his chin out. \u201cProud to be. What\u2019s it to you?\u201d\n\u201cScum,\u201d the young man snarls. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re violent and crude.\u201d\n\u201cYou animals should be exiled,\u201d another says. \u201cYou want to drag China back into the dark days.\u201d\nHe shrugs, but his eyes are wary. \u201cWe just want to be free to have our own families.\u201d\n\u201cYou really want to pass your genes on to a poor child?\u201d someone snaps, and I realize it is me.\nBeneath that ridiculous woolen beanie, his expression remains lofty. \u201cBetter mine than yours.\u201d\nA woman slaps him across the cheek. He stumbles back against the wall, more out of surprise than pain. Before he can react, someone else kicks him in the gut. He drops to his knees. The beanie falls off, revealing a patchy head of hair that reminds me of the simians in our laboratory. Suddenly, he seems such a pathetic and useless creature. A glitch in the course of humanity.\nWhite heat floods my body, the color of euphoria or rage.\nI stumble backward. Around me, the youths are shouting, but I can\u2019t make sense of what they\u2019re saying. My hands sting and throb. The smells of tinny blood and sour urine fill my throat, and I retch.\nThe man is crumpled on the ground. A patch of urine stains the front of his trousers. Bloods pours from a gash on his brow and from his slack mouth. I can\u2019t remember if he was missing teeth before. I notice, with an eerie clarity, that his shoes have fallen off and his socks do not match. One is navy and one is black.\n\u201cGet out of here!\u201d someone shouts, and my legs obey. I flee through the narrow streets, terrified to look back. My face feels frozen, like the painted wooden masks used in opera shows. I find a subway entrance and stumble down into its tunnels. Everyone is staring at me. They must know what sort of person I am, and what I\u2019ve done, and what I\u2019ve become.\nOn the train home, all I can see are the man\u2019s mismatched socks, poking out from his trouser legs. Navy and black, alike but not identical. I cover my face and begin to cry\u2014harsh, hard sobs that shake me to the core.\nIt\u2019s funny how things from your childhood look older and smaller when you come back to visit.\nThe East Hong Kong Children\u2019s Center has always been a vast, impenetrable presence in my mind. But now, the square building peppered with hundreds of square windows seems forlorn rather than forbidding. The walls are weather-stained. The once-red sign cresting the tower is bleached to a salmon pink. As I step through the revolving doors, my shoes trace a threadbare trail in the rug.\nThe foyer hasn\u2019t been updated since its inception. On the walls hang photographs of Hong Kong\u2019s cityscape in 1920, 1980, 2010, 2065. The lemony smell of air freshener wafts to my nose, and the scent makes my heart ache. Is this stagnant, faceless place really where I came from? I imagine myself, framed and hung on the wall: Hong Kong, 2089.\nThe receptionist seems kind. I give her my name, and the reason for my visit, and she flicks a moving map onto my palm-computer.\n\u201cFollow the yellow line,\u201d she says.\nI walk down gray corridors that are both strange and familiar. Unease fills my bones, a quiet itch on the skin of my soul. The place feels haunted. The childhood spirits of myself, Gen, Jingfei, Chao, Suyin, still dwell here. I try to remind myself that I don\u2019t believe in ghosts.\nChildren\u2019s chatter reaches my ears. As I turn the corner, I see a class of seven or eight year olds in a courtyard garden, studying plants through their augmented reality glasses. Four schoolteachers guard them like lampposts. I watch them for a while, wondering about their genetic heritage, wondering if anyone has told them that, in a few years, they will be taken into nurses\u2019 offices and doctors\u2019 surgeries for unspoken procedures. The children clump into groups, heads together, chatting eagerly, then break apart and scamper around, only to reform in new clusters. They look happy.\nI take an elevator to the third floor and walk across to the staff wing. The yellow line leads me to an empty cafeteria. The noise of clanging pots echoes from the kitchen, where the chefs must be preparing lunch. I pick a path between the scattered tables and chairs and reach the glass doors on the far side of the cafeteria.\nThe doors open onto a neatly tended garden balcony. Sunshine presses vibrant warmth to my face. Between potted hibiscus and flowing moneywort, a woman in a brown silk dress sits with her back to me, gazing out over the sprawling, steaming city. Her gray hair trails in a braid down her back.\nAs I approach, I see that the woman is carrying a baby in her arms. She sways, ever so slightly, and hums under her breath. The tune freezes me in my tracks. I stand still, absorbing the low, soft notes. The melody wraps me in a bubble of safety. Suddenly, everything falls into place. The bright sun, drawing life into my skin, drawing color forth from the pink hibiscus. The clanking city, shrinking into smallness beneath me. My birth mother, within arm\u2019s reach, aged and beautiful.\nI must have made a noise, because Deepa turns around. Her face has grown thinner in the last twenty years; her body has grown softer and plumper. The baby is a tiny thing, swaddled in cloth and nestled firmly in her arms. On her left wrist is the jade bracelet that I chose in a perfunctory manner from a vendor twenty years ago.\n\u201cLian,\u201d she says at once, her face full of astonishment.\nShe never expected to see me again. She didn\u2019t believe that I would come to visit her. None of the others returned to the Center. For the first time, I glimpse the sort of grief a mother feels when a child abandons her. The sadness is a punch to the gut.\nI kneel at her feet. Deepa watches me, a question in her eyes, saying nothing. I remember my coldness and condescension at seventeen, and I\u2019m ashamed.\nI want to confess my sins, but I don\u2019t think she would look at me with love if she knew the person I am now. I wonder if she once held me as tenderly as she is holding the infant in her arms. Then, I realize that she must have. Quiet tears trek down my cheeks, and a strange peace spreads within me.\nWith trembling fingers, I touch the bracelet on her wrist and grasp her arthritic hand. Her fingers curl gently around mine. Her knuckles are swollen and stiff. I press my forehead to the back of her hand.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, unable to meet her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nI wonder if I should explain what I\u2019m apologizing for, but I can\u2019t put it into words. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter, anyway. Deepa rests her gnarled hand on my brow, smoothing away my sins.\nThe taxi car is stuck in traffic.\nI don\u2019t mind. I lean back against the leather seat and gaze out of the window. Glassy skyscrapers climb into the clouds. Animated billboards proclaim the wonders of a new skin revitalization cream, and the ecstasies of the latest virtual reality game, and the necessity of purchasing authentic sapphire jewelry for your loved ones. Pedestrians weave through the traffic, glued to their eyepieces and earpieces, guided by their internal autopilot. Hong Kong has a mad, busy beauty to it.\nThe dashboard chimes. \u201cApologies for the delay, Lian. Would you like me to search for an alternative route?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cStaying on course,\u201d says the car. \u201cWould you like to listen to music or a webcast to pass the time?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Lian.\u201d\nMy palm-computer is buzzing with messages. From Director Song: Lian, call me ASAP. We need to talk. I\u2019m sure we can iron out whatever issues have prompted this. From my research partner: Lian, what the fuck? We\u2019re two months away from Stage Four trials. Why didn\u2019t you give me a heads up that you were pulling the plug on us? From my doctorate students: Hi Lian, sorry to hear you\u2019ve resigned so suddenly. Can you let us know who will be supervising our projects from now on? From my first-mother: Lian, what\u2019s going on? I heard a crazy rumor that you quit your job? Please tell me this isn\u2019t true.\nI skim the messages, but they only fill me with exhaustion. I switch off my computer and my earpiece and enjoy the sounds of traffic.\nAn hour later, the car drops me off at Hong Kong International Airport. I pass through glass doors into a light-filled chamber with vaulted ceilings. People walk briskly in all directions, barely dodging one another to make a beeline for their destinations. A 3D projector displays a boggling diagram of upcoming flights. A robotic trolley zips up to me, scans my ID, and offers to take my luggage. I decline. I only have a backpack.\nI approach the departures counter.\n\u201cWhere would you like to travel to today?\u201d the attendant asks.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your earliest flight into Europe?\u201d\n\u201cWe have a flight into Frankfurt in two hours, or London in three.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the Frankfurt flight.\u201d\n\u201cGreat. Will that be one way or return?\u201d\nI hesitate, but only briefly. \u201cOne way.\u201d\nMy feet tap out a brisk tune on the shiny floors. Adrenaline thrums in my chest. Is this what is feels like, to defy expectations? It\u2019s terrifying and intoxicating. I picture the faces of my mothers. I line them up. First-mother, second-mother, third-mother. I see their mothers, too. My Yima, Erma, Sanma. And above them, Deepa. I see the utterly perplexed faces of Director Song, my research partner, my students. I see Jingfei and Gen, as I knew them, years ago, young and bursting with passion and determination. I carry them all within me now.\nI\u2019m shepherded into a queue to pass through security. Beyond the scanners, vast windows allow a view of the runway. A silver jet rises with a roar into the sky, and a second one follows close on its heels. The roar shakes my bones and fills me with life.\nAs I take off my jacket for the security scanners, I notice the asterisk-shaped scar on my inner arm. It\u2019s stained with blue dye.\nGrace Chan is an Aurealis and Norma K Hemming Award-nominated writer and doctor. She was born in Malaysia and lives in Australia.

It was grayscale, overexposed, two-dimensional, and chronologically jumbled. On the film: a mustachioed man doting over his young son at a crowded zoo. A woman vigorously combing the boy\u2019s white hair beside a large piano. A family eating a large meal, candles burning on a table, men wearing yarmulkes, bodies shivering in prayer. A river, people swimming, women in white bathing caps and full-body suits. Men on rocks by the shore, pipes in mouths, smoke drifting lazily upward. A park, the boy looking down at a dead pigeon. Staring. Staring. Father picking him up, kissing him. In the sky, a bright sun.\nA young sun.\n\u201cPardon my intrusion in this time of ends,\u201d a Twirlover said, startling her. The Twirlover\u2019s six separate, hovering pink objects\u2014like human knuckles\u2014danced a looping, synchronized pattern in the air. \u201cIf it pleases you, will you share with me why you watch that flickering device so incessantly?\u201d\nIn some parts of the galaxy one could be killed for being human. Betsy wasn\u2019t sure if this Eluder Ship was such a place. But death was coming for all soon enough. So why fear it now?\n\u201cThis is an ancient film of my paternal ancestor,\u201d she said defiantly.\nPuffs of air beat against her face as the Twirlover spun. \u201cAn ancient film? Indeed, such a rare treasure, an artifact of the past! If it pleases you, may we watch a portion together?\u201d\nShe was about to tell it no, that she\u2019d rather die alone, contemplating what might have been, when the alarm trilled down the cavernous halls of the Eluder Ship. A cold shiver ran down her spine as a cacophony of voices warned in ninety languages simultaneously, \u201cGravitational collapse imminent, my beloveds! Please take your positions inside your transitional shells!\u201d\nAngry rainbows flared across the floor and ozone and ammonia soured the air, warning those who communicated by color or smell. Betsy\u2019s mind skipped and stuttered like the ancient film playing on her wrist as a warning to the telepaths skirted the fringes of her consciousness. Still more warnings she could not perceive with her natural senses no doubt flooded the chamber now.\nHundreds of creatures ran or flew or poured inside their transitional shells, strange cocoons fitted to their variform bodies. The Twirlover tumbled away as Betsy closed the cover of her shell. She hugged her knees and shivered as the glass cover sealed her inside with a hiss and a confirmation beep. A lifeboat or a coffin? She\u2019d find out soon enough.\nTransitional shells filled the gargantuan chamber of the Eluder Ship like arrays of soldiers preparing for battle, their noses pointed toward the red-giant star looming outside. Maera\u2014\u201cThe Daughter Star\u201d\u2014one of the few still-burning stars in the galaxy. It seethed before all, a conflagration as large as a solar system, turning everything the color of blood.\nForty seconds.\nThis was a pitiful end, but it was this or slow starvation, privation, death. The galaxy had been laid sere. No planets to grow food. No stars to keep warm. It wasn\u2019t fair. None of them deserved this. But then she remembered Julio, and what she had done to him at Afsasat.\nI left you to die, Julio. And for that I deserve this.\nThirty seconds.\nSoon now, Maera\u2019s heart would cool by a fraction of a degree, and billions of tons of matter, no longer kept aloft by nuclear winds, would plunge towards its gravitational center at the speed of light. The star would collapse, go nova, and in its tortured heart the universe would tear. A singularity would form, a black hole, and Betsy Haadama and the thousands of others on this Eluder Ship would ride that collapsing wave into another universe. Their matter and energy, transmuted into pure information, would seed a new creation, the World to Come. Their consciousness, over long eons, would push matter into form, coerce dust to life. In some strange new way they would live on, gods reborn further down the corridor of infinity. And they had been doing this forever, would be doing this again and again until the end of time.\nOr so the litany went.\nThe story soothed troubled minds. But the science behind the technology was just a theory. It could be proven only by first-person observation. Any object which crossed a black hole\u2019s event horizon could never communicate with the universe again. Just as easily, she might be annihilated forever. To those witnessing from the outside, there would be no difference.\nTwenty seconds.\nShe tried not to peer up at The Daughter, though its ember light corrupted everything with its hellish glow. Instead she watched the film on her wrist: men in fedoras, women in ostentatious hats at an airport, people descending a stairwell from plane to tarmac. A baby hoisted in the air. Smiles. Laughing. Cut to a park. The boy looking down at the dead pigeon, staring. Staring. Father picking him up, patting him on the shoulder. The boy, crying.\nWhy do you stare at the bird? Betsy thought. What are you thinking?\nShe looked up at the seething star. So beautiful, terrible, immense. A wonder that such a thing existed. A horn bellowed and Betsy screamed.\n\u201cFalse Alarm! Beloveds, the imminent collapse was a false alarm! Spurious readings caused us to make an erroneous conclusion. We estimate at least six hours before stellar collapse, based on present readings.\u201d\nThe voice announced the message in multiple languages, simulcast with aggressive rainbows, smells, alien sensations.\nI\u2019m alive! she thought. I\u2019m still here! It felt exhilarating, for a moment. Then she remembered she\u2019d have to do this again.\nSlowly, shells opened and creatures emerged. Betsy scanned the motley lot of them as her cover retracted. A zoo of sentient species escaping from their cages, creatures made of every color, texture, and temperament.\nSo much life, she thought. Snuffed out by the Horde. Crimes beyond forgiveness. And made all the more vile because the Horde had been the progeny of the human race.\nBetsy activated inositol in her bloodstream via thought command in order to suppress her panic/flight response. It soothed her, but only just enough to notice the hairs on the back of her neck rising from an electrostatic charge as the Twirlover returned.\n\u201cThat was exciting!\u201d it said.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it that,\u201d Betsy said.\n\u201cTo be so close to annihilation and then to come back again. It renews the sense of life!\u201d\n\u201cOr the dread of living.\u201d\n\u201cBut the dread, if you explore it,\u201d the Twirlover said, \u201creveals the miracle of existence out of nothingness. From out of horror comes life.\u201d\nThe litany again. \u201cOr out of life, horror,\u201d she said.\nIt tumbled quietly for a moment. \u201cSometimes.\u201d It moved closer to inspect her film. \u201cThat\u2019s a child of your species, is it not?\u201d\nShe glanced down at her screen. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a rhinoceros.\u201d\n\u201cRee-Nos-Ur-Us. What a marvel of composition, all those rolling mountains of flesh. Does it still exist?\u201d\n\u201cExtinct.\u201d\nThe Twirlover whistled a mournful, descending arpeggio. \u201cLike so much life in the galaxy. Like the once-glorious stars.\u201d\nThe Horde had obliterated stars by the billions. They had wrapped the Milky Way inside a bleak cocoon of transmatter so that nothing, no ship, no signal\u2014not even light\u2014could pass. And then they vanished, leaving the galaxy to rot. Such was the legacy of humanity.\nShe wondered if the Twirlover would kill her outright if it knew what she was. Death by physical means might be preferable, she thought, to being flash-baked into quantum-entangled gamma rays. Six in one, really.\nThe film cut to a boy in a crib, bouncing. His mother lifting him, smiling for the camera. The boy laughing.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of us,\u201d she said. \u201cMy paternal ancestor.\u201d Surprising herself, she felt pride.\n\u201cAh, such wonderful protuberances!\u201d\nA wisp of dust coalesced above Betsy\u2019s head. Winking diamonds swirled in yellow clouds. An aeroform creature. For a moment she glimpsed her own face of colored sparkles reflected back at her. But the aeroform being soon spiraled away, only to pause a few seconds later before a group of fronded Whidus who turned their mushroom-like eyes in her direction. Maybe they recognized her, knew what she was. Maybe they were plotting her demise.\nA second, identical Twirlover approached Betsy and said to the first, \u201cYou know, my bonded-one, that we are about to die, do you not?\u201d\n\u201cI was about to come back to you, my flesh-bond,\u201d the first said. \u201cAnd tell you about my sharing with this creature.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed you were. I saw you tumbling towards me with great haste.\u201d\n\u201cMy flesh-bond, just take a good look at her smooth, auburn skin, the fine black threads that emerge from her head, the little valve at her peak where she modulates her words with a bacteria-laden pink muscle! And on her upper-left protuberance, that metal device which flicker-flashes with strange images. She watches it incessantly. She is curious, is she not?\u201d\n\u201cThere is something curious here, certainly.\u201d\n\u201cMy love, let us join so I can share my thoughts with you.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, I look forward to it!\u201d\nThe two tumbled together into a single dancing, twelve-piece ring. Knuckles hopped, bounced, tumbled over each other. Music piped and whistled in byzantine harmonies. There arose a great shriek about them, and soon after they separated again into six-pieced individuals. Betsy thought they might have interchanged pieces in the process.\n\u201cNot fair!\u201d said the second. Or was it the first? Betsy couldn\u2019t tell them apart anymore. \u201cYou playful trickster! You gave me your segment, so now I know your thoughts. But then, you sense my emotions too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat joy it is to share mind with you, beloved! Yes, I feel your misplaced jealousy. And so much of it! What a waste of energy. Don\u2019t you see? This creature is alone and needs to share with someone!\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but does it have to be you?\u201d\n\u201cNot me alone, but us together!\u201d\n\u201cIn this last hour, you would defile us?\u201d\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Betsy interjected. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be alone anyway\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOne must never be alone!\u201d the first said. \u201cShare with us! Let us merge gloriously with your words.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, tell us,\u201d the second said, \u201cDid you have a bonded-one who abandoned you, who wandered off to have intercourse with strangers when you need him?\u201d\n\u2019Intercourse?\u2019 she thought. Perhaps there was more to the Twirlover concept of sharing than she realized. \u201cActually, I left him.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you did,\u201d the second said. \u201cLike attracts like.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you abandon him?\u201d the first said.\nInteresting, the way it had interpreted her words. \u201cI left him at the first nova,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Mother Star. Afsasat.\u201d\n\u201cYou were at Afsasat and you didn\u2019t go through the event-horizon?\u201d the second said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe your story! Beloved, look how she defiles this union!\u201d\n\u201cSurely,\u201d the first said, \u201cyou are joking, trying to please us with paradox? Why would you do something so idiotic? Why not escape through Afsasat when you had the chance?\u201d\nShe sighed and turned her attention to the film on her wrist. Mustachioed father and blond-haired son walking down a path. Father, smiling. Boy running, falling. Crying. Father picking him up, kissing him. All better. All better.\n\u201cDid you hear our questions?\u201d the first asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s a very long story.\u201d\n\u201cOur lives are stories. We are empty without them. Fill us so we may fill you.\u201d\nStrangely, she had stopped shivering. She even felt a little warm. If this was intercourse, then she was determined to be a good lover. \u201cThis film is part of \u2018The Biography,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cA record of my ancestors\u2019 lives that was encoded within my genes.\u201d\n\u201cSuch joy! I have heard of this technology, the sharing of such immensity,\u201d the first said. \u201cHow far back do your records go?\u201d\n\u201cAbout six thousand years.\u201d\nThe second squealed.\n\u201cI told you, beloved,\u201d the first said. \u201cShe is share-worthy.\u201d\nHer mother had told her the story in the quiet hours while drifting under the ash streams of the decimated Magellanic Clouds, or over stale, thrice-brewed tea, while the ice-blue rings of Cegmar rose above the horizon, or while her mother gently brushed her hair and chills trickled down her spine. When he turned seventy, the boy in the film digitized his aging childhood reels and then gave them to his son. His son added films, photos, and memorabilia and passed the collection to his offspring. His children added more history and passed this collection on again. This continued for generations. Eventually his descendants decided to encode this amalgamated history within their DNA, so it would never be lost or forgotten. Every child was thereafter born with the memories of their parents, and theirs before them, and theirs before them. And also in their bodily archives were the early records\u2014the films, photos and keepsakes that started the tradition. The Biography was an ancient and unbroken chain that began with this black and white film playing on her wrist. The first.\nAnd now the last.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so large!\u201d the second said.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she said.\n\u201cYour story,\u201d the first said, \u201cTo carry all that history within you!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in me anymore. Julio and I stripped all of it, every last base-pair, from our genes. I recall only my personal experiences now. This computer . . . it holds the last copy. This is the Biography, now.\u201d\nThis fragile, solitary thing on her wrist.\n\u201cBut why?\u201d Moans and tweets. \u201cThat must have been an immense loss!\u201d\nThe answer was complex, full of shame and guilt. Instead she offered the highly edited version. \u201cBecause we wanted to enter the World to Come without a past.\u201d\nThe Twirlovers tumbled noisily, screeching.\n\u201cI put the Biography on this ancient computer,\u201d she said, pointing to her wrist. \u201cIt belonged to my grandmother, five hundred and eighty years ago. Julio and I parked our starsloop in orbit around Afsasat and we stowed this wrist-player in our shrine-room. We said goodbye to our past and then we flew over to the Eluder Ship. Our starsloop and the Biography within would be destroyed when Afsasat went nova.\u201d\nChirps. Squeals.\n\u201cBut Afsasat took its time. So I explored every corner of the Eluder Ship. I discovered that none of my species were there. That meant Julio and I might be the last of my kind in existence. And that meant the Biography was the last of its kind too.\u201d\nA duet of whistles in a major key.\n\u201cI used to recall the smell of my great-grandmother\u2019s hair of twenty-three generations ago as her lover leaned in to kiss her pink lips. I knew every defect in the bathroom tiles of the beach house where my ancestor Rhindi lived four thousand years ago. I could hear the gulls cry as they flew in the colored dawn as the four suns rose, one green, one orange, one yellow, and one blue before Eleanor left her family for war, to die in deep space, but not before she had a son to pass on the memory. I once remembered the joy Yalta felt toward his seventeen lanky daughters, all born in zero-g, all tall, graceful, beautiful, with eyes like blue giants. These weren\u2019t others\u2019 lives. They were mine. I had lived these lives too.\u201d\nSeven long, high notes.\n\u201cSo many people had once lived inside of me. Even these memories that I\u2019m telling you about now\u2014they come from this device! Not from me! I\u2019m silent inside. And I realized that if I let the Biography die I would be murdering billions. Just like the Horde.\u201d\nA very human gasp, then a precipitous pause.\n\u201cSo I changed my mind. I decided I\u2019d bring the Biography with me into the World to Come. My ancestors deserved that much. I was about to retrieve it from our starsloop, but Julio held me. Afsasat could go nova at any moment, he said. And . . . he wanted to sever us from the past. I disagreed.\u201d\nBetsy started shaking again as the moment became clear in her mind. She remembered his exhausted, pleading eyes, his unruly black beard.\n\u201cDid you forget what they did?\u201d Julio had said. \u201cDid you erase that memory too? The Horde, the progeny of the human race, stole our children! And you want to bring their history with us? We decided we wouldn\u2019t allow that. The Biography has to be destroyed.\u201d\n\u201cI know what we decided, Julio!\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t let all those people die!\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re already dead, Betsy!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just said that.\u201d Her face grew hot. \u201cThey\u2019re not dead! They once lived within us! They gave us our lives, and we owe them our memories!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that way at all.\u201d\n\u201cJulio, how can you abandon them so easily?\u201d\n\u201cThey led us to this place of death and horror. I sever myself from the past for that reason alone.\u201d\nAnd in the end, it was she who had abandoned him.\nShe swallowed down her tears as the Twirlovers squealed and beckoned her to continue.\n\u201cI told Julio I wanted to wander the ship alone, and instead I snuck off to fetch the Biography. Maybe he knew where I was going. I\u2019ll never know. I reached my starsloop and was ready to return when I heard the alarm. Afsasat was collapsing. One minute to nova. Not enough time to return safely. I panicked. I had to save the Biography, all those lives, from destruction. Nothing else mattered. I powered up my ship and fled.\u201d\nFor weeks she had wondered, did Julio search the Eluder Ship for her? What did he feel when he realized she had left him? Like the thoughts of the boy in the film, she\u2019d never know. He had entered a black hole, and nothing could cross that dark horizon.\nThe Twirlovers cried out, a piercing shriek. Perhaps they orgasmed together. Eventually, the second said, \u201cWhat a dirty tale! So much abandonment. I feel defiled. A sinner! This is the kind of sharing you wanted, my beloved?\u201d\n\u201cBut in fetching her Biography she returned to her people!\u201d the first said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? Isn\u2019t sharing so much more rewarding after a long absence?\u201d\n\u201cYou twist words easily, my bonded-one! Her story was . . . acceptable.\u201d\nA large Perslop sloshed towards them. The creature was amber, a gelatinous three-limbed starfish with translucent skin and dozens of eyes like upturned brown bowls.\n\u201cDo you wish a comforting invocation?\u201d the Perslop said. A slit tucked into one of its armpits burped open to reveal hundreds of tiny white teeth, and its warm breath reeked of dead seas. \u201cI know rituals from a thousand faiths. Or, if you wish, you may teach me one.\u201d Its voice was like wind blowing over ruins.\n\u201cBlessings, smooth-skinned pleasure to behold!\u201d the first Twirlover said. \u201cWe welcome a fourth to share!\u201d\n\u201cNo we do not!\u201d the second Twirlover said.\n\u201cMy flesh-love, please!\u201d the first said. \u201cDo not be rude.\u201d Then to the Perslop: \u201cInstead of an invocation, my finely contoured friend. Will you share a story with us?\u201d\n\u201cIncorrigible!\u201d the second said, tumbling furiously.\nWith the moist end of one if its arms, the Perslop inched towards Betsy\u2019s wrist. The tip opened into a tripod of three small fingers, with diminutive brown eyes capping the end of each. The eyes wiggled nervously above the ancient film. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d it asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s her people\u2019s history!\u201d the first said. \u201cFrom six-thousand years ago!\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cYour race hasn\u2019t changed much.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a duck,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cExtinct.\u201d\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s you there?\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s a walrus. Also extinct.\u201d\n\u201cThen whose history did you say we are watching?\u201d\n\u201cMy race. They\u2019re at a zoo.\u201d\n\u201cA \u2018zoo?\u2019\u201d the Perslop said.\n\u201cA place that housed animals in cages.\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cSo they could observe them without danger to themselves,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAnother act of separation!\u201d the second Twirlover said. \u201cSuch a barbaric, dirty race!\u201d\n\u201cHer filth notwithstanding, keeping something caged is not barbarism,\u201d the Perslop said, its moist arm dangling an hairsbreadth from Betsy\u2019s face. \u201cBefore the Horde destroyed my brothers, I used to travel with my colony to a fecal press, where we severed one of our limbs and tortured it in a cage until it released a small amount of feces. We then burned that feces as an offering to the Absent One. They were profoundly holy events. And I miss them very, very much.\u201d\nThe second Twirlover squeaked loudly three times.\n\u201cYou see, my beloved?\u201d the first said. \u201cThis is the joy you have missed by withdrawing from union all these years!\u201d\nOn Betsy\u2019s wrist the film played on, men in white shorts and shirts playing handball. Women sitting on the sidelines bringing smoky cigarettes to their lips. The young boy, a few years older, standing on a porch, talking to a beautiful girl.\n\u201cYou simplify my thoughts!\u201d the second Twirlover said. \u201cI take no joy in the suffering of others. If I did, I would find pleasure in the atrocities of the Horde. But those are stories I never wish to hear again. If I could, I would erase them from history like this creature erased this Biography from her genes!\u201d\nIf only that were possible, Betsy thought. To rewrite history. If so, she\u2019d go even further back, to the creation of the Horde, more than three hundred years ago. Humanity had been evolving rapidly for generations. They had augmented their consciousness to the point that the body became irrelevant. Flesh was now a temporary abode, while the mind was free to explore and play in infinite space. Epic works of art, science, and philosophy were commonplace. Physical suffering had been eradicated. It was a true Golden Age of humankind.\nBut the Hagzhi, a prideful, stoic and gargantuan species that had once peacefully abided humans, became fearful of humanity\u2019s growing power over matter and began to spread lies and sow seeds of mistrust. Later, the Hagzhi began to systematically exterminate humans as a way to prop up their own faltering galactic hegemonies. Humanity was nearly destroyed in the wars that followed, but after that tumult, humans vowed that they would never let such a catastrophe happen again. Through heroic feats of research they discovered the secret folds of negative time and learned the simple mystery behind the origins of consciousness. They learned how to, with a thought, create a sun. And with another, destroy it.\nThe Hagzhi race vanished from existence in a day. One hundred and seventy planets, moons, outposts and stations erased from the universe. Later, for no reason anyone could discern, other races vanished. Races which had never threatened humanity. The Onyx Horde, as this force came to be known, acted without cause or reason.\nNot all humans accepted the rise to supra-consciousness. Not all humans wanted to change. The Horde slaughtered those who resisted. Those who hid were found, tortured, and killed. And there were those, like Betsy\u2019s ancestors, who had made a deal and were spared.\n\u201cKeep the Biography in your genes,\u201d the Horde had commanded her ancestors. \u201cKeep your physical human form. Do this and you will not die.\u201d\nAnd her ancestors agreed, and survived, even prospered, while the rest of the galaxy was ruined. When the other races discovered that there were humans who were spared the Horde\u2019s madness, that the Horde were the progeny of the human race, the long dormant seeds of doubt that the Hagzhi had planted re-sprouted, this time across the entire galaxy. Humans were slaughtered without remorse, and the Horde did not come to save them.\nIf I were given that choice now, Betsy thought. To live or die by their rules, I would have chosen death. I\u2019d rather die than live under their darkness another instant.\nOn the film, a crowded beach. People swimming. Large umbrellas casting shadows. Wisps of cloud in the sky, all under a bright sun.\nA young sun.\nThe Twirlovers stopped twirling. The Perslop leaned in closer to see.\n\u201cSuch a young sun,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cBright and warm. The sight fills me with sadness. No longer do such stars burn in the Milky Way. Here we orbit this dying star in a dead galaxy where only a few cinders burn in a quiescent sea. And all about the universe a hundred billion galaxies dangle forever beyond our reach. The Onyx Horde has sealed us forever from their glorious light. May their souls be stripped from eternity!\u201d\nOn the film, a party. People laughing, dancing, hands on hips, forming a human train. Cone-shaped hats.\n\u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d the Perslop asked.\n\u201cA party,\u201d Betsy said. \u201cA new year\u2019s celebration.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why do they bounce up and down?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re dancing.\u201d\n\u201cDo you remember, my soul-union,\u201d the first Twirlover said, \u201chow we danced for three ascensions of the Hagic Moon with the birth of our tumble-litter?\u201d\n\u201cI shall never forget!\u201d the second said, squealing. \u201cOur many tumblers, searching for their bond-sisters. How they merged and separated a thousand times before they joined the sisters to complete their soul!\u201d\n\u201cMay they find the path to the Glory Star that resides at the center of creation.\u201d\nOn the film, the blond boy in the corner staring into the camera eye. I\u2019d always assumed that one day someone would look into the Biography and see me. But I\u2019m the last, aren\u2019t I?\n\u201cYour children, are they dead?\u201d the Perslop said to the Twirlovers.\n\u201cThey were living on Ental,\u201d the second said. \u201cIt was obliterated by the Horde.\u201d A hiss like a distant wave crashing on an empty beach.\n\u201cI had nine offspring,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cThree died in the disastrous attempt to pass through the galaxy\u2019s transmatter shell. Three died of malnutrition. Two died in an experiment to create a new star.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s only eight,\u201d the first Twirlover said. \u201cAnd the ninth?\u201d\n\u201cSuicide.\u201d\nOn the film, an elderly couple in formal clothing sitting beside a bright window. Their bodies in silhouette. The woman, Bessie. The man, Oser. Betsy\u2019s oldest ancestors in the Biography. She and Julio had named their children after them. A boy and girl. Twins. She remembered their puffy, newborn faces, their eyes hungry for life.\nShe and Julio and her children had been living on the temperate moon of Aeoschloch with one hundred other Biography-carrying humans, far from the wars and the suspicions of the other races. And one morning, as the swirling black eye of the gas giant Ur rose above the distant hills, as she was breast-feeding her twin children, she was swept away.\nShe could not see or hear or sense anything, even her own screams, but she felt a presence probing her, scanning her, reading and rereading the Biography within her as if it were the most important thing in the universe. And she knew this presence, remembered it from the Biography and the memories within.\nThe Onyx Horde.\nThen the Horde spit her and a hundred other humans out over the sandy coastline. Some people did not rise from the cold beach. Their eyes stared lifeless into the starless sky. Some had organs missing or were merged with others into horrible grotesqueries. Some went mad. Some had reappeared in the ocean and drowned. And the children, all the pre-pubescent ones, had vanished. The Horde had taken them. Every one.\nOser and Bessie, two months old, barely enough time to open their eyes and learn their parents\u2019 faces. Gone.\nThe seventy surviving colonists were wrecked, devastated. Should they have more children? No, they decided, the Horde could just as easily take them again. Should they try to forget and live out their lives on this backwater moon? No, how could they ever find joy again, knowing that the Horde could come again at any time? Then the colonists heard about Afsasat, the Eluder Ship being built there and a possible way to escape the Horde forever.\nAnd so it was decided. The colonists would end their history on their own terms. They would attempt to enter the World to Come, but without the Biography inside of them. They would excise it from their genes, shedding themselves from the thing which the Horde seemed so desperately to desire. Shedding themselves of humanity\u2019s sordid history. It would be, in their own small way, revenge.\nBut they\u2019d have to get to Afsasat first. The Eluder Ship was being constructed in a quadrant of space that was rumored to be tolerant of humans. But the colonists would have to navigate through large quadrants of dangerous space. So they traveled in many ships, by multiple circuitous and zigzagging routes. Betsy and Julio arrived safely. When Betsy walked around the ship, looking for other humans, she found none. They were the last two.\nAnd now, on this second Eluder Ship, there was only her.\nOutside the windows, lightning the size of a hundred dead planets forked across Maera\u2019s surface. The star looked ancient, tired, ready to sleep forever. The aliens throughout the chamber paused to stare up at the star.\nHer wrist flickered like the star outside. On the film, the mustachioed man. The woman with the beautiful black hair. Another party. A different day. A cake with five flames. Eyes reflecting candlelight. The boy, blowing the flames out. Smoke and applause. Silent cheer.\n\u201cYou said you wanted a story,\u201d the Perslop said, \u201cWell I have one. A few weeks ago I confronted a group of wandering Ergs. One told me that he\u2019d captured a human\u2014\u201d\nBetsy started in her seat.\n\u201cThe Erg said the human was an ugly, repulsive thing,\u201d the Perslop continued. \u201cWith dark hair covering most of its carbuncle head, and liquid leaking from its odious eyes. It pleaded for its life. And the Erg, a compassionate being, decided ultimately to let it go. But afterward he became terribly distraught. He said he\u2019d missed his opportunity to destroy a creature which had caused so much of the galaxy\u2019s pain. For a long time I considered this Erg\u2019s position.\n\u201cI once had a vast starship. I found a bore-worm nibbling in my refuse berth. I believed in the sanctity of all life, and decided to let it live. Six weeks later, my ship was infested with bore-worms, and no one would dock with me for fear of having their hulls eaten. I had to incinerate my ship. You see, I let one worm live, and thousands returned to ruin me. Is it not the same with humans? If we let one live, do we not give them the chance to destroy us again? I told the Erg that he did the righteous thing, but I truly did not\u2014do not\u2014believe it myself.\u201d\nThe Twirlovers chirped quietly.\n\u201cWhere did he find this human?\u201d she blurted. \u201cHow many weeks ago was this?\u201d Dark hair covering its head? she thought. Julio, is he speaking of you?\nThe first Twirlover said, \u201cPlease, tell us more, beloved! This is wonderful!\u201d\n\u201cWhat more is there to tell?\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cWe may be reborn in a new universe, but if we carry that worm along with us, do we not risk infestation again?\u201d\nBetsy stared into the Perslop\u2019s tripod eye-cups. It knows, she thought. It knows what I am. Then she remembered the aeroform creature studying her and the Whidus staring at her and the Twirlovers\u2019 odd behavior around her.\nThey all know, she thought. Every one of them knows!\n\u201cDo not fear, human,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cI\u2019ll not kill you. I define myself by being what you are not. I let you live even though every pulse of my hearts says you should be squashed between my arms like vermin.\u201d\nBetsy stared at the Perslop, shivering. Weakly, she said, \u201cWas your story about the human true?\u201d\nOutside, a brilliant solar flare leaped from Maera and grew angrily out into space. The Daughter, shedding her last vestiges of life. Soon now.\nThe Perslop gestured to her screen. \u201cIs your story true? Is not history filled with lies and obfuscations?\u201d\nOn the screen, a beach, waves crashing silently. Umbrellas casting large shadows. A beautiful young woman smiling shyly at the camera. The future wife of the boy. A burning ball of light in the sky. Everyone watched the screen.\n\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cAnd gone forever . . . \u201d\nSilence. Even the Twirlovers went still.\n\u201cPlease!\u201d she said. \u201cTell me! Was it true?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cWhy should I tell you? Why do you deserve an answer?\u201d\nShe took a deep breath. \u201cBecause someone I love might still be alive,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s everything.\u201d\nThe alarm trilled, startling her. \u201cGravitational collapse imminent, beloveds! Please take your positions inside your transitional shells!\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d she cried. \u201cNot yet!\u201d\nThe Perslop began to move away.\n\u201cWait!\u201d she screamed. \u201cPlease tell me!\u201d\nThe Perslop paused but did not turn back. \u201cI am the last of my kind,\u201d the Perslop said. \u201cI came over here to tell you that you are not.\u201d\nThe Twirlovers shrieked and suddenly merged. They tumbled madly, yelping, barking, while the Perslop left for its transitional shell.\nNinety seconds to collapse.\nMaera flickered and angry waves rippled across its surface, but Betsy could not summon the will to close her shell. On her viewscreen, the park, the blond-haired boy skipping, scaring away pigeons. Dappled sunlight. A breeze through trees. A dead pigeon on the dirt. The boy, stopping, staring. Staring.\nSuddenly, she understood why the boy stared at the bird for so long.\nThis is the first time you knew death! she thought. You knew the bird would never rise again. And you knew that one day you\u2019d fall too, that everything falls! That\u2019s why you gave these films to your son. You wanted him to remember you, forever!\nSeventy-five seconds.\nThe Perslop had been right, she thought. I could be polluting the new universe with this history.\nSixty-five seconds.\nBut all those lives, erased? I can\u2019t kill you, great-great grandfather. You are the first. Without you, we would be nothing. My ancestors, without all of you, I am nothing.\nSixty seconds.\nThe fourteen billion-year history of this universe had already unfolded. But for the World to Come, the story had yet to be written. Maybe the World to Come was a lie, but then again, maybe there was new life on the other side of the event horizon. Maybe they truly had been doing this forever and ever. A flower gone to seed.\nShe jumped out of her transitional shell, took off her grandmother\u2019s computer from her wrist, and placed it inside the shell. Then she pressed the button to seal it inside.\nShe\u2019d send the Biography, its mammoth history, with its eons of joys and sorrows, through Maera. She hoped that in the next universe, humanity would be different. Better. What every parent wishes for her children.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d she said.\nThe Twirlovers still tumbled together in the air beside her, as wild as a radioactive atom. The alarm continued to wail. \u201cGet in your shells!\u201d she screamed. But they ignored her.\nTwenty seconds.\nShe ran to the rear of the chamber and leaped into an escape pod. She pressed the emergency activator and in an instant she was hurtling away from the Eluder Ship at a large fraction of the speed of light. In the window behind her, Maera blinked twice, like two eyes closing, then began to fade. The star shrunk to half its size, and a moment later the sky filled with white light. The ship bleated a thousand warnings as Betsy closed her eyes.\n\u201cI\u2019m coming, Julio. I\u2019m coming for you.\u201d\nShe had watched the ancient film so often that it still played in her mind, projecting on the back of her eyes like a movie screen. The boy in the park, running, laughing. Falling. Scuffing his knee. Father picking him up, kissing him, comforting him. Above them, a sun.\nA young sun.\nMatthew Kressel is a writer & software developer.

Everyone else had already gone home, relief flooding their faces as they exited the ward.\nQina wasn\u2019t her usual carefree self\u2014but who could blame her? She was in the middle of a cold war with her boyfriend, after all. She was determined to not initiate any contact and to not pick up even if he called, though secretly she was watching his every move on the web and updating her own status with great deliberation. She was sure he couldn\u2019t resist peeking.\nShe turned on the displays built into the shell of every piece of equipment: the counter, the sides of the filing cabinets, the casing of the medication cabinet . . . until photos and videos flowed over every surface, vivid web pages competed for space, and exaggerated smiles and star-gazing looks of melancholy appeared and disappeared, one after another, all parts of the silent, colorful wallpaper. Her personal web secretary was scouring the social networks, hunting for traces of Paul.\nAuntie Han was away from the nurses station, checking up on the patients. Qina thought it a useless gesture. What was the point? The conditions of the patients never changed: they weren\u2019t dead yet but hardly living. The more she saw of them, the more she found them tiresome. But Auntie Han never skipped the rounds. She was the sort who made sure she scraped out the last grain of rice in her bowl and who always knew where her hat and gloves could be found. Qina and she were from completely different worlds.\nIf sorrow were a kind of protein, who wants to be my digestive enzyme?\nQina chuckled at the status update she had drafted. Already, she was feeling better. Chewing on her pen, she pondered the next line.\nAuntie Han came back. \u201cQuick! Come with me. There\u2019s a problem with patient 21.\u201d\nUnwilling to go, Qina continued to mull over her draft on the notepad. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cCome! I\u2019m worried he\u2019s going into shock.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Qina tossed the pen down. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same thing. Give it a rest.\u201d\n\u201cI think we have to increase the dosage,\u201d explained Auntie Han. \u201cI need you to confirm my plan.\u201d\nThe two left the nurses station and walked into the corridors of the ward. Qina set her web secretary on vibrate and put the phone back in her pocket. Carefully, she buttoned her white hospital coat, which she knew showed off her curves well.\nThe corridors were empty. Surgical carts and IV stands rested against the walls, while bags of medical waste were piled in the corners for collection. Two rows of bright white lights along the ceiling illuminated the drawings and photographs of human brains on the walls, evoking a horror-film atmosphere.\nQina tossed a piece of candy into her mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with these people, but their families insist on bringing them here. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re going to die if they stay put at home.\u201d\nAuntie Han kept her tone kind. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame them for worrying. After all, they\u2019re family. We have to be understanding.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You\u2019re so full of compassion that you must be a living Buddha, and I\u2019m just the mean yaksha.\u201d Qina stuck her hands in the pockets of her hospital coat and fairly skipped down the stairs.\nAuntie Han ignored her sarcasm. \u201cWe have all this sophisticated equipment here. And I\u2019m sure the families feel better when professionally trained nurses are caring for their loved ones.\u201d\n\u201cOh please.\u201d Qina laughed. \u201cYou think our shitty neurotransducers are sophisticated? Anyone can now afford a few electrodes and stick them on their heads. If they administered the treatments at home, maybe they\u2019d get better results.\u201d\n\u201cBut we have the program that procedurally generates non-duplicative stimuli. The results are better.\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference does it make if the \u2018stimuli\u2019 repeat? Do you really think they remember everything they get fed day after day? If you used a recording of a hundred ducks quacking I imagine the result would be the same.\u201d\nThe two stopped in front of the recovery room. Auntie Han sighed.\n\u201cSometimes they have no choice, you know. If multiple members of the family came down with it, everyone would be lying in bed, unable to take care of one another. They deserve compassion.\u201d\nQina said nothing, though her expression remained defiant.\nAuntie Han adjusted her glasses on the bridge of her nose and solemnly lectured her like a school headmaster. \u201cThe situation is quite serious, as I mentioned at the meeting last week. So many have contracted the condition that a significant portion of the population is now hospitalized. The more this spreads, the fewer chances there are for regular social interactions and care, and more people will be incapacitated. The end result of this vicious cycle is everyone in the hospital.\n\u201cThe problem won\u2019t go away if we ignore it. We\u2019re dealing with a new form of social anxiety here that will continue to worsen unless there is adequate research. My monograph, the most extensive and serious attempt at scholarly analysis of the issue to date, is about to be published. I drew on some research from anxiety sociology. If you\u2019re interested, I can show you the galleys next week after I get them\u2014\u201d\nQina looked behind Auntie Han, her expression one of shock. \u201cOh! Why is patient 20 sitting up?\u201d\nAuntie Han whipped around. \u201cWhat!?\u201d\n\u201cOops, you missed it,\u201d said Qina. \u201cHe\u2019s lying down again.\u201d\nAuntie Han said nothing more. The two nurses entered the room. Casually, Qina turned on the displays on the cabinet doors and in the picture frames on the wall, filling them with her usual set of websites. Anxiously, she refreshed her feed and found two new replies, both reaction gifs from her girlfriends, but nothing from Paul. Rather annoyed, she slapped the fleshy bottom of her web secretary, sending it back into the sea of data to continue its hunt. Auntie Han, apparently displeased with the flickering lights that flooded the room, gestured for Qina to shut off the displays, but Qina pretended to not see her.\nThe two nurses first went to patient 21. Still unconscious, her body convulsed from time to time. One hand was held in front of her chest, two fingers curled tightly. Qina and Auntie Han helped her into a sitting position, wiped her mouth and face, massaged her arms, fed her some water, and gave her medication. Patient 21 was a plump woman in her forties, with sparse hair and smooth skin. Even sitting up, her eyes were closed. Qina remembered that she had been in a coma for a long time.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of even staying alive like this?\u201d said Qina with a sigh.\n\u201cLiving is living,\u201d said Auntie Han. \u201cShe\u2019s not that different from anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cIf I were like that, I\u2019d kill myself,\u201d said Qina. \u201cTo be dependent on others to stay alive . . . ugh, I\u2019d rather be dead!\u201d\n\u201cEveryone depends on everyone else to live,\u201d said Auntie Han. \u201cI wrote about this very concept in my book . . . \u201d\nJust as they were about to connect the neurotransducer to patient 21, patient 20 suddenly wheezed as though he was suffocating. No matter how hard his lungs labored, he just couldn\u2019t seem to get enough air. Patient 20 was a short man of rather homely appearance. But even in his coma, his family had tried to follow his grooming habits by keeping his hair brushed neatly to one side. His hands clutched at his paper gown like the lapels of a suit jacket. He continued to pant and heave, his brows furrowed, his expression one of pain and struggle. It took the two nurses a great deal of work to get him to lie down again and to attach the electrodes of the neurotransducer to his head. Once the machine was turned on and the stimuli waveforms flowed into his brain, he finally calmed down.\nPatient 20\u2019s symptoms were very typical. After first contracting the condition, many initially thought they were coming down with a respiratory disease, though no firm diagnosis could be made. Oxygen made no difference, and neither did the posture of the patient sitting or lying down. A few patients had died before someone finally thought of the neurotransducer and discovered the true nature of the disease: the respiratory symptoms were caused by a disorder in the brain.\nThe web secretary alerted Qina: Paul\u2019s trail had been discovered on some woman\u2019s page.\nQina raced to the display on the cabinet door and stared at Paul\u2019s comment. It was literally nothing more than \u201cLike.\u201d\nThe woman wasn\u2019t anyone they knew; rather, she was a celebrity, a spokesperson for a tech company, and rather popular on social media for her attempts at educating the public about new scientific discoveries and novel technologies. Paul often viewed her videos.\nIn reality, what the woman talked about in those videos made no difference. In Qina\u2019s eyes, her most important asset was her beauty. The purpose of these videos in which she posed with cutting-edge products wasn\u2019t to promote the products, but to show off her looks. Qina viewed the woman as a contemptible birdbrain addicted to the praise and attention of others, craving the spotlight. Yet, it was unbelievable how many people fed her vanity every day, giving her exactly what she wanted.\nTrembling, Qina updated her own feed. The vain are despicable.\nShe focused on that \u201cLike\u201d from Paul again. Here they were, in the middle of the greatest fight ever for the very survival of their relationship, and instead of sending her pleas for forgiveness, Paul had had the temerity to go to some pretty woman\u2019s page to post \u201cLike.\u201d\nQina fumed. Just look at the actual post from the woman that Paul was responding to! \u201cNew product announced: an invisibility cloak for the web so that you can hide from those bloodhound web secretaries.\u201d How dare he! This is a slap in the face!\nUnable to stop herself, she updated her status again. I\u2019m so depressed I want to die. I\u2019m going to feed on memories and drink acid.\nShe took it out on the web secretary, pounding and slapping its furry body. But the web secretary didn\u2019t resist; it simply ran around the page, and every time it was cornered, it gazed up at her with round, watery eyes. She couldn\u2019t bear to hit it anymore, and in rage she tossed the page away and returned to Auntie Han. The senior nurse had already wiped the faces of patients 22 and 23.\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven,\u201d said Auntie Han as she glanced at her watch. \u201cI\u2019ve got to check on the incubators in the lab. Why don\u2019t you finish up here?\u201d\nShe strode out of the room with her back ramrod straight. It was exactly eleven o\u2019clock.\nLeft alone, Qina\u2019s feeling of abandonment worsened. She wanted to cry, but a few dry sobs brought no tears. She stomped her foot, and her sense of grievance swelled, along with an empty silence in her heart. But the sense of being wronged couldn\u2019t fill that hole. She turned off all the displays and the room dimmed. All the cabinets and walls returned to their habitual grayness, the metal surfaces cold and flat, like the unmoved distant presence of God, gazing at her from afar.\nShe roughly attached the electrodes helter-skelter to patients\u2019 heads and flipped on the switches of the neurotransducers. She didn\u2019t care if her terrible mood was going to affect the generated patterns at all. She had lost her boyfriend, so who cared what happened to a few comatose patients? Number 22 had once been a pretty movie star, but she aged so poorly that as soon as she was in her thirties no one cared about her anymore. Number 23 was an author of little note who devoted himself to waging war on others with his poisoned pen. He claimed that bestselling authors were frauds and that he alone was a great writer. His evidence? Kafka and Cao Xueqin had been unable to publish while alive, and he wasn\u2019t getting published either. Q.E.D.\nAll the patients had their own personalized algorithms to generate just the patterns their brains craved. Qina glanced over the words scrolling up the screens on each of the neurotransducers to be sure that the correct stimuli were being fed into each brain.\n\u201cWonderful! You\u2019ve got to live your own life! You\u2019re so beautiful! I made the healthy soup according to your recipe, and it was great! You\u2019re such a beauty, zaftig and so sexy, a million times better than those ugly matchstick girls!\u201d This was the stimuli fed to number 21. Patient 21 curled up in her bed, a look of sweet joy filling her face. Her heavy body rubbed against the sheets, wrinkling it. With some effort, Qina straightened the sheets again and wiped her mouth.\n\u201cMy whole family are your biggest fans!!! We love hearing you speak, especially me! I think you\u2019re the funniest man alive. I was going to kill myself, but you, you\u2019ve given me strength and courage!\u201d This was the stimuli for number 20. Patient 20 twitched and he thrust his hips up into the air excitedly, in time to the rhythm of the praise.\n\u201cDo you still remember me? I\u2019ve been supporting you for more than a decade! You\u2019re such a wonderful actress, far more skilled than those new starlets. What a degraded age we live in, but I\u2019ll always remember you! You\u2019re a classic! I love you!\u201d This was for number 22. Patient 22 had always been relatively quiet. She continued to lie there with her eyes closed, the corners of her mouth curving up slightly. She raised her arms and stretched them out, like a statue of the Holy Mother.\n\u201cKeep it up! You\u2019re the conscience of humanity, the bravest warrior! Illegitimi non carborundum! To waste time with them will only lower your intelligence. They\u2019re nothing. They attack you only because you speak the truth. History will remember you!\u201d This was for number 23. Instead of simply passively receiving his stimuli, he was constantly muttering something, echoing the tone and rhythm of the words fed into his mind. Qina couldn\u2019t hear what he was saying exactly, but she knew that he was trying to repeat some argument in various languages and using different words. He seemed to be constantly on the attack, and the neurotransducer\u2019s signals only urged him on more.\nBy the time she was finished with everyone, it was after midnight. Exhausted, she sat down on an empty bed, heart as tired as her body. She felt like the last living person in the world. The room, full of featureless, smooth metal, reflected her monotonous mood. She took out her phone and refreshed her feed. There were no new replies; perhaps everyone had gone to bed. Still no new traces of Paul. Helplessly, she sat in the middle of the ward, and the gray walls and floor seemed to be the whole universe.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t I try it once? she thought. Just once.\nShe lay down on the bed and attached a few electrodes to her forehead. Closing her eyes, she pressed the maroon button on the machine.\nThe neurotransducer hummed, scanning her thoughts. Then, she heard the hypnotic words streaming into her mind, like a dear friend trying to make her feel better, or perhaps like a trusted counselor trying to guide her with wisdom. Her heart relaxed as though it had been massaged, and as her breathing smoothed out, the gray hospital ward disappeared from her vision.\nShe saw a dew-dappled lawn in morning sunlight.\n\u201cYou are a person of depth, and the shallow can\u2019t understand you!\u201d The voice echoed in her mind, so confident-sounding that what it said could not be doubted. \u201cYou are far more beautiful than those shallow girls, but you despise their narcissism. The vain are despicable, and those who live by appearances will eventually find themselves hated. You are so much deeper than they are, and those who love you will eventually understand this truth.\u201d\nQina\u2019s heart quieted, and the world seemed so full and alive. Paul was a nobody, less than a nobody. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was asleep or awake, but she loved the vibrant green spread all around her in the sun.\nSuspended on the border between sleep and wakefulness, she thought, it\u2019s not so bad to live like this forever, is it?\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, April 2013.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nBorn in 1984 in Tianjin, Hao Jingfang graduated in 2006 from the Tsinghua University, majoring in physics.

Story sale! I\u2019m going to be in an anthology releasing later this year. It\u2019s a YA GamerLit anthology called Game On!\nHooray!\nBut wait! This is the same anthology that I was supposed to be a part of last summer, before it even had a name. It really will be coming out this month, and I\u2019ll be in it.\nBut not in the way I was supposed to be.\nWhich is kind of okay. I mean . . . I\u2019m a gamer. And the publishing industry, at its heart, is just a game. We choose a character and arm ourselves with whatever\u2019s handy\u2014the pen is mightier than the sword, right?\u2014and head out into the world at Level 1, like blind little greenlings with a Charisma of infinity!\nWe know we\u2019re going to face monsters and pitfalls. We know we will accrue damage points. But if we are lucky, we find our tribe\u2014and heal ourselves. We get Experience Points (xp) and we Level Up. Our tools become better. Our stats get higher. And we learn how to work smarter, not harder.\nSometimes, of course, it\u2019s hard. You try and you try and you try and can\u2019t seem to finish a quest or have battled the same monster over and over.\nBut then sometimes, it ends up all working out anyway.\nGame On! is a perfect Case in Point.\nHere\u2019s what happened:\nLevel 1\nThe Game On! anthology was originally slated for Summer of 2018. The ringleader was Anthea Sharp, owner of Fiddlehead Press, and when she asked me if I\u2019d be on board for a YA GamerLit anthology, I didn\u2019t hesitate.\nThe deadline was July 10th of last year and because of my own excitement about the project, I finished my story early. It was called \u201cThe Chaos Crushers\u2019 Day Off,\u201d about a dark guild of orc hunters who decide to tackle a role-playing game on their day off.\nI was so in love with this story and these characters. Even my local SCBWI (Society of Children\u2019s Book Writers and Illustrators) group gave excellent feedback. Beta readers also offered praise and I couldn\u2019t wait for the anthology to be finished.\nLevel 2\nNow, when we turn in our stories for some of the other anthologies that Anthea publishes in January, the finished product releases the next month in February. I assumed that since the stories were due in July, that the book would be out by August (before Dragon Con! Yay!).\nSilly, Level 2 me. This proves true that old adage about assuming things and said practice creating a self-made ass out of u and me.\nI wanted to announce the anthology at Gen Con, but we didn\u2019t even have a title yet. Or a cover. I suspected the worst.\nThe anthology continued to not happen for Reasons. I sat on my story like a good little author, waiting.\nLevel 3\nNow, it wasn\u2019t like I wasn\u2019t doing anything during this time. I had all sorts of side quests to keep me busy\u2014most importantly, Dragon Con. Since I had a full hour to read at Dragon Con, I performed \u201cThe Chaos Crushers\u2019 Day Off.\u201d The response was tremendous. A seven-year-old boy giggled through the whole thing. My excitement continued to build about the project.\nAnd after that hot and muggy week in Atlanta, I had to drive up north to see family. Then, I had a Picture Book Boot Camp with Jane Yolen. Continuing on, I had four more projects to write in December\u2014an invite-only anthology, a Kickstarter anthology, a short comic anthology, and still yet another story.\nLevel 4\nIn early December, I was approached by IGMS Magazine for a short story reprint. Now, at this level, short story reprints are something of a very little gold mine that some authors don\u2019t even know to pursue (I really should make more of an effort).\nOf course, I said YES. But also, I had this original story still sitting in my trunk collecting dust.\nI had promised the story to Anthea. But Game On! (we had a title, but still no cover) had been postponed indefinitely at this point, and I needed the money. It felt horrible and underhanded to sell this story to someone else. So, I did what any sane gamer would do in this instance: I phoned a friend.\nMaurice Broaddus and I have been friends since we were both filling out our character stats. As a good friend should, Maurice will tell you that I\u2019ve never been Level 0 in this industry, but you get the gist. I confessed my horrible thoughts and was met with silence on the line.\nAnd then Maurice said, \u201cWhat would Pic do?\u201d\nFor those who don\u2019t know, Tom Piccirilli was our Obi-Wan Kenobi back when we were just starting out. Heck, he still is my Ben. Because mentors like Pic are never really gone.\nPic would have pointed out that it\u2019s business. Writing is our business. Letting perfectly good writing molder in the trunk is not good for business. Pic would have said all of that, in his thick New York accent, and then added a \u201cDon\u2019t be stoopid!\u201d for good measure.\nAs soon as I got off the phone with Maurice, I told Anthea that I was pulling my story out of Game On! and promptly sold \u201cThe Chaos Crushers\u2019 Day Off\u201d to IGMS at pro rates.\nLevel 5\nOf my slated aforementioned December projects, two were canceled before I even started the invite-only anthology and the comic anthology. I wrote another story for a different anthology called \u201cTrue.love,\u201d about how a bunch of hacktivists try to take down the world\u2019s most perfect matchmaking site. It was like a fairy-tale \u201cReady Player One.\u201d\nYes\u2014my main character was a gamer.\nIronic, isn\u2019t it? This story also would have been perfect for Game On! Oh, well. By now, Anthea had a cover and was planning a release.\nIn March, Anthea asked me about \u201cChaos Crushers\u2019 Day Off.\u201d She\u2019d take a reprint, but it hadn\u2019t even released yet. I wouldn\u2019t have reprint rights back for a while. Boo.\nSometimes, when you\u2019re a writer, timing just doesn\u2019t work in your favor. It just stunk, because I really wanted to be in that anthology.\nAnd then . . .\nLevel 6\nAnthea sent me another email. \u201cWould you consider including \u2018True.love\u2019 in the Game On! anthology?\u201d\nOf course, I didn\u2019t hesitate!\nI don\u2019t even have to ask permission from the editor of the new project, Once Upon a Star, because Anthea is the editor. She\u2019s the king of her own small press\u2014she makes the rules, and she can break them if she wants to! She can also give out secret side quests.\nI love that I was able to make it work by just being me and I effectively got to sell the story twice! Bonus! Reach the castle and claim my prize! But the game isn\u2019t over. The game is never over.\nThis writing Princess will always be in another castle.\nAlethea Kontis is a princess, author, fairy godmother, and geek.

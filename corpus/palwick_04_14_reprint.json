It was already dark out by then, and it had been snowing all afternoon. I\u2019d been sitting at the kitchen table with my algebra book, trying to concentrate on quadratic equations, and then the handheld beeped and lit up and the transmitter signal started blipping on the screen, and I looked at it and cursed and ran upstairs to double-check the signal position against my topo map. And then I cursed some more, and started throwing on warm clothing.\n I\u2019d spent five days staring at my handheld, praying that the screen would light up again, please, please, so I\u2019d be able to see where Bobo was. The only time he\u2019d even stayed away from home overnight, and it was when the satellites were out. Just my luck.\n Or maybe David had planned it that way. Bobo had been missing since Monday, the day the satellites went down, and David had probably opened the door for him when I wasn\u2019t looking, like always, and then given him an extra kick, gloating because he knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to follow Bobo\u2019s signal.\n I hadn\u2019t been too worried yet, on Monday. Bobo was gone when I got back from school, but I thought he\u2019d come home for dinner, the way he always did. When he didn\u2019t, I went outside and called him and checked in neighbors\u2019 yards. I started to get scared when I couldn\u2019t find him, but Mom said not to worry, Bobo would come back later, and even if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d probably be okay even if he stayed out overnight.\n But he wasn\u2019t back for breakfast on Tuesday, either, and by that night I was frantic, especially since the satellites were still down and I had no idea where Bobo was and I couldn\u2019t find him in any of the places where he usually hung out. Wednesday and Thursday and Friday were hell. I carried the handheld with me everyplace, waiting for it to light up again, hunched over it every second, even at school, while Johnny Schuster and Leon Flanking carried on in the background the way they always did. \u201cHey, Mike! Hey Michael\u2014you know what we\u2019re doing after school today? We\u2019re driving down to Carson, Mike. Yeah, we\u2019re going down to Carson City, and you know what we\u2019re going to do down there? We\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\n Usually I was pretty good at just ignoring them. I knew I couldn\u2019t let them get to me, because that was what they wanted. They wanted me to fight them and get in trouble, and I couldn\u2019t do that to Mom, not with so much trouble in the family already. I didn\u2019t want her to know what Johnny and Leon were saying; I didn\u2019t want her to have to think about Johnny and Leon at all, or why they were picking on me. Our families used to be friends, but that was a long time ago, before my father died and theirs went to jail. Johnny and Leon think it was all my father\u2019s fault, as if their own dads couldn\u2019t have said no, even if my dad was the one who came up with the idea. So they\u2019re mean to me, because my father isn\u2019t around anymore for them to blame.\n It was harder to ignore them the week the satellites were down. Mom\u2019s bosses were checking up on her a lot more, because their handhelds weren\u2019t working either. We got calls at home every night to make sure she was really there, and when she was at work, somebody had to go with her if she even left the building. Just like the old days, before the handhelds. And God only knew what David was up to. I guess he was still going to his warehouse job, driving a forklift and moving boxes around, because his boss would have called the probation office if he hadn\u2019t shown up. But he wasn\u2019t coming home when he was supposed to, and every time he did come home, he and Mom had screaming fights, even worse than usual.\n So I had five days of not knowing where Bobo was, while Johnny and Leon baited me at school and Mom and David yelled at each other at home. And then finally the satellites came back online on Friday. The GPS people had been talking about how they might have to knock the whole system out of orbit and put up another one\u2014which would have been a mess\u2014but finally some earthside keyboard jockey managed to fix whatever the hackers had done.\n Which was great, except that down here in Reno it had been snowing for hours, and according to the GPS, I was going to have to climb 3,200 feet to reach Bobo. Mom came in just as I was stuffing some extra energy bars in my pack. I knew she wouldn\u2019t want me going out, and I wasn\u2019t up to fighting with her about it, so I\u2019d been hoping the snow would delay her for a few hours, maybe even keep her down in Carson overnight. I should have known better. That\u2019s what Mom\u2019s new SUV was for: getting home, even in shitty weather.\n She looked tired. She always looks tired after a shift.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said, and looked over my shoulder at the handheld screen, and then at the topo map next to it. \u201cOh, Jesus, Mike. It\u2019s on top of Peavine!\u201d\n I could smell her shampoo. She always smells like shampoo after a shift. I didn\u2019t want to think about what she smells like before she showers to come home.\n \u201cHe\u2019s on top of Peavine,\u201d I said. \u201cBobo\u2019s on top of Peavine.\u201d\n Mom shook her head. \u201cHoney\u2014no. You can\u2019t go up there.\u201d\n \u201cMom, he could be hurt! He could have a broken leg or something and not be able to move and just be lying there!\u201d The signal hadn\u2019t moved at all. If it had been lower down the mountain, I would have thought that maybe some family had taken Bobo in, but there still weren\u2019t any houses that high. The top of Peavine was one of the few places the developers hadn\u2019t gotten to yet.\n \u201cSweetheart.\u201d Mom\u2019s voice was very quiet. \u201cMichael, turn around. Come on. Turn around and look at me.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t turn around. I stuffed a few more energy bars in my pack, and Mom put her hands on my shoulders and said, \u201cMichael, he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n I still kept my back to her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s been gone for five days now, and the signal\u2019s on top of Peavine. He has to be dead. A coyote got him and dragged him up there. He\u2019s never gone that high by himself, has he?\u201d\n She was right. In the year he\u2019d had the transmitter, Bobo had never gone anywhere much, certainly not anywhere far. He\u2019d liked exploring the neighbors\u2019 yards, and the strips of wild land between the developments, where there were voles and mice. And coyotes.\n \u201cSo he decided to go exploring,\u201d I said, and zipped my pack shut. \u201cI have to go find out, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cMichael, there\u2019s nothing to find out. He\u2019s dead. You know that.\u201d\n \u201cI do not know that! I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Except that David\u2019s a piece of shit. I did turn around, then, because I wanted to see her face when I said, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been home since Monday, Mom, so how do I know what\u2019s happened? I haven\u2019t even seen him.\u201d\n I guess I was up to fighting, after all. It was an awful thing to say, because it would only remind her of what we were all trying to forget, but I was still happy when she looked away from me, sharply, with a hiss of indrawn breath. She didn\u2019t curse me out, though, even though I deserved it. She didn\u2019t even leave the room. Instead she looked back at me, after a minute, and put her hands on my shoulders again. \u201cYou can\u2019t go out there. Not in this weather. It wouldn\u2019t even be safe to take the SUV, or I\u2019d drive you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHe could be lying hurt in the snow,\u201d I said. \u201cOr holed up somewhere, or\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMichael, he\u2019s dead.\u201d I didn\u2019t answer. Mom squeezed my shoulders and said gently, \u201cAnd even if he were alive, you couldn\u2019t reach him in time. Not all that way; not in this weather. Not even in the SUV.\u201d\n \u201cI just want to know,\u201d I said. I looked right at her when I said it. I wasn\u2019t saying it to be mean, this time. \u201cI can\u2019t stand not knowing.\u201d\n \u201cYou do know,\u201d she said. She sounded very sad. \u201cYou just won\u2019t let yourself know that you know.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I told her, my throat tight. \u201cI can\u2019t stand not seeing, then. Is that better?\u201d\n She took her hands off my shoulders and sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll call Letty, but it\u2019s not going to do any good. Is your brother home?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. David should have been home an hour before that. I wondered if he even knew that the satellites were back up.\n Mom frowned. \u201cDo you know where he is?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you think I care? Call the sheriff\u2019s office, if you want to know where he is.\u201d\n Mom gave me one of her patented warning looks. \u201cMichael\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHe let Bobo out,\u201d I said. \u201cYou know he did. He did it on purpose, just like all the other times. Do you think I care where the fuck he is?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going to go call Letty,\u201d Mom said.\n David hated Bobo the minute we got him. He was my tenth birthday present from Mom and Dad. The four of us went to the pet store to pick him out, but when David saw the kittens, he just wrinkled his nose and backed up a few feet. David was always doing things like that, trying to be cool by pretending he couldn\u2019t stand the rest of us.\n David and I used to be friends, when we were younger. We played catch and rode our bikes and dug around in the dirt pretending we were gold miners, and once David even pulled me out of the way of a rattlesnake, because I didn\u2019t recognize the funny noise in the bushes and had gone to see what it was. I was six then, and David was ten. I\u2019ll never forget how pale he was after he yanked me away from the rattling, how scared he looked when he yelled at me never, ever to do that again.\n The four-year difference didn\u2019t matter back then, except that it meant David knew a lot more than I did. But once he got into high school, David didn\u2019t want anything to do with any of us, especially his little brother. And all of a sudden he didn\u2019t seem so smart to me anymore, even though he thought he was smarter than shit.\n I named my new kitten Bobcat, because he had that tawny coat and little tufts on his ears. His name got shortened to Bobo pretty quickly, though, and that\u2019s what we always called him\u2014everybody except David, who called him \u201cHairball.\u201d By the time Dad died, Bobo was a really big cat: fifteen pounds, anyway, which was some comfort when David started \u201caccidentally\u201d letting Bobo out of the house. I figured he could hold his own against most other cats, maybe even against owls. I tried not to think about cars and coyotes, and people with guns.\n He started going over the fence right away, but he was good about coming home. He always showed up for meals, even if sometimes he brought along his own dessert: dead grasshoppers, and mice and voles, and once a baby bird. Dr. Mills says that when cats bring you dead prey, it\u2019s because they think you\u2019re their kittens, and they\u2019re trying to feed you.\n Bobo was a good cat, but David kept letting him out, no matter how much I yelled at him about it. Mom tried to ground David a couple of times, but it didn\u2019t work. David just laughed. He kept letting Bobo out, and Bobo kept going over the fence. It took me four months of allowance, plus Christmas and birthday money, to save up enough for the transmitter chip and the handheld. David laughed about that, too.\n \u201cHe\u2019s just a fucking cat, Mike. Jesus Christ, what are you spending all your money on that transmitter thing for?\u201d\n \u201cSo I can find him if he gets lost,\u201d I said, my stomach clenching. Even then, I could hardly stand to talk to David.\n \u201cIf he gets lost, so what? They have a million more cats at the pound.\u201d\n And you\u2019d let them all out if you could, wouldn\u2019t you? \u201cThey don\u2019t have a million who are mine,\u201d I said, and Mom looked up from chopping onions in the kitchen. It was one of her days off.\n \u201cDavid, leave him alone. You\u2019re the one who should be paying for that transmitter, you know.\u201d And they got into a huge fight, and David stomped out of the house and roared off in his rattletrap Jeep, and when all the dust had settled, Mom came and found me in my room. She sat down on the side of the bed and smoothed my hair back from my forehead, as if I was seven again instead of thirteen, and Bobo jumped down from where he\u2019d been lying on my feet. He\u2019d been licking the place where Dr. Mills had put the transmitter chip in his shoulder. Dr. Mills said that licking would help the wound heal, but that if Bobo started biting it, he\u2019d have to wear one of those weird plastic collars that looks like a lampshade. I hadn\u2019t seen him biting it yet, but I was keeping an eye on him. When Mom sat on the bed, he resettled himself under my desk lamp, where the light from the bulb warmed the wood, and went back to licking.\n Bobo always liked warm places. Dr. Mills says all cats do.\n Mom stroked my forehead, and watched Bobo for a little while, and then said, \u201cMichael\u2014sometimes you can know exactly where people are, and still not be able to protect them.\u201d As if I didn\u2019t know that. As if any of us had been able to protect Dad from his own stupidity, even though the pit bosses knew exactly where he was every time he dealt a hand.\n I knew Mom was thinking about Dad, but there was no point talking about it. Dad was gone, and Bobo was right in front of me. \u201cI\u2019d keep him inside if I could, Mom! If David\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you would.\u201d And then she gave me a quick kiss on the forehead and went downstairs again, and after a while, Bobo got off the desk and came back to lie on my feet. Watching him lick his shoulder, I wondered what it felt like to have a transmitter.\n I\u2019m the only one in the family who doesn\u2019t know.\n Letty\u2019s Mom\u2019s best friend; they\u2019ve known each other since second grade. Letty works for the BLM, and they have really good topo maps, so she could tell me exactly where Bobo was: just inside the mouth of an abandoned mine.\n \u201cHe could have crawled there to get out of the snow,\u201d I said. The transmitter signal still hadn\u2019t moved. Mom and Letty exchanged looks, and then Mom got up.\n \u201cI\u2019m going upstairs now,\u201d she said. \u201cYou two talk.\u201d\n \u201cHe could have,\u201d I said.\n \u201cOh, Michael,\u201d Mom said. She started to say something else, but then she stopped. \u201cTalk to Letty,\u201d she said, and turned and left the room.\n I listened to Mom\u2019s footsteps going upstairs, and after a minute Letty said, \u201cMike, it\u2019s not safe to go out there now. You know that, right? It wouldn\u2019t be safe even in a truck. Not in this weather. And in the snow, you can know exactly where something is and still not be able to get at it.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cLike that hiker last year. The one whose body they didn\u2019t find until spring.\u201d Except that the hiker hadn\u2019t had a transmitter, so they hadn\u2019t known where he was. It didn\u2019t matter. For ten days after he went missing, the cops and the BLM had search teams and helicopters all over the mountain, and never mind the weather.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Letty said, very quietly. \u201cExactly.\u201d She waited for me to say something, but I didn\u2019t. \u201cThat guy was dying, you know. He was in a lot of pain all the time. His wife said later she thought maybe that was why he went out in a storm like that, while he could still go out at all.\u201d\n Letty stopped and waited again, and I kept my head down. \u201cHe went out in bad weather,\u201d she said finally, \u201cnear dark. It\u2019s snowing now, and you were getting ready to hike up the mountain when your mom got home at seven-thirty. Michael?\u201d\n \u201cBobo could still be alive,\u201d I said fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s not like anybody else cares. It\u2019s not like the state\u2019s going to spend thousands of dollars on a search and rescue!\u201d\n \u201cSo you were thinking\u2014what?\u201d Letty said. \u201cThat you\u2019d go up there and get everybody hysterical, and get a search going, and while they were at it, they\u2019d bring Bobo back? Was that the plan?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. I felt a little sick. I hadn\u2019t thought about any of that. I hadn\u2019t even thought about how I was going to get Bobo back down the mountain once I found him. \u201cI just\u2014I just wanted to get Bobo, that\u2019s all. I thought I could go up there and it would be okay. I\u2019ve hiked in snow before.\u201d\n \u201cAt night?\u201d Letty asked. Then she sighed. \u201cMike, you know, a lot of people care about Bobo. Your mom cares, and I care, and Rich Mills cares. He was a sweet cat, and we know you love him. But we care about you, too.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I told her. I wasn\u2019t sitting in the mouth of a mine during a snowstorm. I wasn\u2019t registered with the sheriff\u2019s office.\n \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be fine if you went up on Peavine tonight,\u201d Letty said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. And even if Bobo\u2019s still alive\u2014and I don\u2019t think he can be, Michael\u2014you can\u2019t help him if you\u2019re frozen to death in a gully somewhere. Okay?\u201d\n I stared at the handheld, at the stationary signal. I thought about Bobo huddled in the mouth of the mine, getting colder and colder. He hated being cold. \u201cIs it true that when you freeze to death,\u201d I said, \u201cyou feel warm at the end?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what I hear,\u201d Letty said. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to test it.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t either. That wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d\n \u201cGood. Don\u2019t do anything stupid, Mike. Search and rescue might not be able to get you out of it.\u201d\n I felt like I was suffocating. \u201cI was putting food in my pack. An entire box of energy bars. Ask Mom.\u201d\n Letty shrugged. \u201cEnergy bars won\u2019t keep you from freezing.\u201d\n \u201cI know that.\u201d\n \u201cGood. And one more thing: don\u2019t you pay any mind to those Schuster and Flanking kids. They\u2019re slime.\u201d\n I jerked my head up. How did she know about that? She raised an eyebrow when she saw my face, and said, \u201cPeople talk. Folks at my office have kids in your school. The bullies are slime, Michael, and everybody knows it. Don\u2019t let them give you grief. Your mother\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n \u201cI know she is.\u201d I wanted to ask Letty if she\u2019d told Mom about Johnny and Leon, wanted to beg her not to tell Mom, but the way adults did things, that probably meant that telling Mom would be the first thing she\u2019d do.\n Letty nodded. \u201cGood. Just ignore them, then.\u201d\n It was easy for her to say. She didn\u2019t have to listen to them all the time. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t why I was going out,\u201d I told her. \u201cI was going after Bobo.\u201d\n \u201cI know you were,\u201d Letty said. \u201cI also know nothing\u2019s simple.\u201d She folded her topo map and stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019d better be getting on home, before the weather gets any worse. Tell your Mom I\u2019ll talk to her tomorrow. And try to have a good weekend.\u201d She ruffled my hair before she went, the way Mom had when Bobo got the chip. Letty hadn\u2019t done that since I was little. I didn\u2019t move. I just sat there, looking at the blip on the handheld.\n After a while I went up to my room. David hadn\u2019t come back yet, not that I cared, and Mom\u2019s door was closed. I knew she was sleeping off the shift. I also knew she\u2019d be out of bed and downstairs in two seconds if she heard David coming in or me going out. She\u2019d hung the front and back doors with bells, brass things from Nepal or someplace she\u2019d gotten at Pier One. You couldn\u2019t go out or come in without making a racket, and you couldn\u2019t take the bells off the door without making one, either. \u201cYou learn to sleep lightly when you have babies,\u201d Mom told me once, as if either me or David had been babies for years. And our windows were old, and pretty noisy in their own right. And it was snowing harder.\n So I just sat on my bed and stared out the window at the snow, trying not to think. My window faces east, away from Peavine, towards downtown. I couldn\u2019t see the lights from the casinos because of the snow, but I knew they were there. After a while it stopped snowing, and a few stars came out between the clouds, and so did the neon: the blue and white stripes of the Peppermill, which stands apart from everything else, south of downtown, and the bright white of the Hilton a bit north of that\u2014\u201cthe Mother ship,\u201d Mom always calls it\u2014and then, clustered downtown, the red of Circus Circus and the green of Harrah\u2019s, which Mom calls Oz City, and the flashing purple of the Silverado, where Dad used to work.\n Dad loved this view; he was so proud that we could look down on the city. He couldn\u2019t stop crowing about it to all his friends. I remember when he brought George Flanking and Howard Schuster, Leon and Johnny\u2019s dads, into my room so they could look out my window, too. So they could see \u201cthe panorama.\u201d That was what Dad called it. We\u2019d never been able to see anything from our old windows, except more trailers across the way. \u201cI\u2019m going to get us out of this box,\u201d Dad said when we lived there. \u201cWe\u2019re going to live in a real house, I swear we are.\u201d And then we moved here, to a real house, and pretty soon that wasn\u2019t big enough for him, either.\n I shut my blinds and flopped down on my bed. Someplace a dog had started to bark, and then another joined in, and another and another, until the whole damn neighborhood was going nuts. And then I heard what must have set them off: the yipping howl of a coyote, trotting between houses looking for prey.\n When we bought our house five years ago, the street ended a block from here, and that was where the mountain started. Winter mornings, sometimes, we\u2019d see coyotes in our driveway. Now the developers have built another hundred houses up the street, with more subdivisions going up all the time: fancy houses, big, the kind we could never afford, the kind that made Dad\u2019s eyes narrow, that made him spend hours hunched over his desk. The kind he talked about when he went out drinking with George and Howard, I guess. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s buying those big houses; casino and warehouse workers can\u2019t afford places like that. Mom could, maybe, if she weren\u2019t saving for nursing school. The only people I can think of who might live there are the ones who work for the development companies.\n So we don\u2019t get coyotes in our driveway anymore, but they\u2019re still around. They travel in back of the houses, next to the six-foot fences people put around their yards. There\u2019s still sagebrush between the subdivisions, and rabbits, and you can still follow those little strips of wildness to the really wild places, up on the mountain.\n Coyotes are unbelievably smart, and they\u2019ll eat anything if they have to, and it doesn\u2019t bother them when people cut the land into pieces. They like it, because the boundaries between city and wilderness are where rodents live, and rodents are about coyotes\u2019 favorite food, aside from cats. So when we cut things up for them, there are more edges where they can hunt. It doesn\u2019t hurt that we\u2019ve killed most of the wolves, who eat coyotes when they can, or that coyotes look so much like dogs. They can sneak in just about anyplace. Dr. Mills says there are coyotes living in New York City now, in Central Park. There are millions of them, all over the country.\n Ranchers and farmers hate them because they\u2019re so hard to kill, and because even if you kill them, there are always more. But I can\u2019t hate them, not even for eating cats. They\u2019re smart and they\u2019re beautiful, and they\u2019re just trying to get by, and as far as I can tell, they\u2019re doing a better job of it than we are. They know how to work the system. That\u2019s what Dad thought he was doing, but he wasn\u2019t smart enough.\n I lay there, listening to that coyote and to all the dogs, still trying not to think, but thinking anyway: about what a weird town this is, where you get casinos and coyotes both, where the developers are covering everything with new subdivisions, but there\u2019s still a mountain where you can die. After a while it got quiet again, and I peeked out the window and saw more snow. A while after that I heard the bells jangling downstairs, and heard Mom\u2019s feet hitting her bedroom floor and thudding down the stairs. When she and David started yelling at each other, I pulled my pillow over my head and finally managed to go to sleep.\n It wasn\u2019t snowing when I woke up on Saturday, but it looked like it might start again any minute. The transmitter signal still hadn\u2019t moved, and when I thought about Bobo out there in the cold, I felt my own heart freezing in my chest. I heard voices from downstairs, and smelled coffee and bacon. Mom and David were both home, then. I threw on clothing and grabbed the handheld and ran down to the kitchen.\n \u201cGood morning,\u201d Mom said, and handed me a plate of bacon and eggs. She was wearing sweats and looked pretty relaxed. David was wearing his bathrobe and scowling, but David always scowls. I wondered what he was doing up so early. \u201cAny change on the screen, Mike?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. I knew she didn\u2019t think there ever would be, and I wondered why she\u2019d asked. David\u2019s face had gone from scowling to murderous, but that was all right, because I planned to be out the door as soon as possible.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Mom said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going up there after breakfast.\u201d\n \u201cWe are?\u201d I said.\n \u201cYour brother\u2019s coming whether he wants to or not, and I asked Letty to come too. Rich Mills has to work this morning. Unless you\u2019d rather not have all those people, honey.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. So that\u2019s what David was doing up. Mom was making him come as punishment, so he could see what he\u2019d done, and Letty was coming because she had the maps, and maybe to help Mom keep me and David apart if we tried to kill each other. And Mom wouldn\u2019t think it was important to have Dr. Mills there, because she didn\u2019t think Bobo was still alive. I put down my plate and gulped down some coffee and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go put the carrying case in the SUV.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to eat first,\u201d Mom said. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n I sat. Driving up Peavine in the snow wasn\u2019t exactly Mom\u2019s idea of a day off; the least I could do was not give her any lip. David bit into his toast and said around a mouthful of bread, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\n That was fine with me, but I wasn\u2019t going to say so in front of Mom. It was their fight. \u201cYou\u2019re coming,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd if Bobo\u2019s still alive you\u2019re paying the vet bills, and if he\u2019s not, you\u2019re buying your brother another cat. And if we get another cat you\u2019ll damn well help us keep it in the house, or I\u2019ll call the sheriff\u2019s office myself and tell them to take you off probation and put you in jail, David, I swear to God I will!\u201d\n She would, too. Even David knew that much. He scowled up at her and said, \u201cThe cat didn\u2019t want to stay in the house.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the issue,\u201d Mom said, and I stuffed my face full of eggs to keep from screaming at David that he\u2019d hated Bobo, that he\u2019d wanted Bobo to die, and that I hoped he\u2019d die, too: alone, in the cold.\n I remembered one of the first times David had let Bobo out. Bobo didn\u2019t have the transmitter yet, and I was in the backyard calling his name. Suddenly I saw something race over the fence and he ran up to me, mewing and mewing, his tail all puffy. I picked him up and carried him inside and he stayed on my lap, with his face stuck into my armpit like he was hiding, for half an hour, until finally he calmed down and stopped shaking and jumped down to get some food. I\u2019d hoped that whatever had spooked him so badly would keep him from wanting to go out again, even if David opened all the doors and windows, but I guess he forgot how scared he\u2019d been. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to freeze to death, either,\u201d I said.\n David pushed his chair back from the table and said, \u201cLook, whatever happened to your fucking cat, it\u2019s not my fault, and I\u2019m not wasting my day off going up there.\u201d He looked at Mom and said, \u201cDo whatever you want: it doesn\u2019t matter. I might as well be in prison already.\u201d\n \u201cBullshit,\u201d Mom said. \u201cIf you go to prison, you\u2019ll lose a lot more than a Saturday. Do you have any idea how lucky you are not to be there already? Especially after the stunts you\u2019ve been pulling this week?\u201d Nevada\u2019s a zero-tolerance drug state, even for minors, so when David got caught driving stoned last year, with most of a lid of pot in the glove compartment of his Jeep, Mom had to use every connection she had to get him probation instead of jail. It would have been a \u201cjuvenile facility,\u201d since David was still a few weeks short of eighteen, but Mom says her connections said that wouldn\u2019t make much difference. Juvenile facilities are worse, if anything.\n Mom didn\u2019t say who her connections are, and I don\u2019t want to know. Whoever they are, I figure they didn\u2019t help David entirely out of the goodness of their hearts. I figure they were scared of what Mom could tell people about them, even if what she does is legal.\n \u201cI told you,\u201d David said, \u201cI\u2019ve just been hanging out with some guys from work. You know: eating dinner, playing pool? I was in town.\u201d\n \u201cRight,\u201d Mom said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no way anybody could check that with the satellites down, is there? That\u2019s what you were counting on.\u201d\n David rolled his eyes. \u201cWhat time did the damn GPS go back up last night? Six-thirty or something? We were still eating then. We were at that pizza place in the mall. Call the sheriff\u2019s office and ask them, if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d He jerked a thumb at my handheld and said, \u201cHow stupid do you think I am? I knew it could come back online any second. What, I\u2019m going to take off for Mexico or something?\u201d\n Mom didn\u2019t bother to answer. She and I were the smart ones in the family: David took after Dad. Anybody stupid enough to get caught with that much pot was stupid enough to do just about anything else, as far as I could tell, but the only time I\u2019d even started to say anything like that, right after his arrest, David had just glared at me and said, \u201cYeah, well, if you\u2019d had to look at what I had to look at, you\u2019d smoke dope too, baby brother.\u201d\n As if I hadn\u2019t wanted to look. As if I hadn\u2019t kept trying to go outside. As if even now I didn\u2019t keep imagining what it had looked like, a million different ways, enough to keep me awake, sometimes.\n But even then, I knew that David had only said it to make me feel guilty. He knew just how to get at everybody. Now he gestured at the handheld again and said bitterly, \u201cI can\u2019t wipe my ass without those people knowing about it.\u201d\n He was needling Mom, because that\u2019s what Dad had always said about dealing blackjack at the Silverado. The dealers were under surveillance all the time: from pit bosses, from hidden cameras. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away from it,\u201d Dad said. \u201cIt\u2019s like working in a goddamn box, with the walls closing in on you.\u201d But Dad chose his box, and so did David.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the issue,\u201d Mom told David again. \u201cIt\u2019s more than staying in county limits, David. You\u2019re supposed to come home straight after work. You know that.\u201d\n \u201cSo you\u2019re my jailor now? Just like the casino was Dad\u2019s and the Lyon County cops are\u2014\u201d\n \u201cStop it,\u201d Mom said, her voice icy. \u201cI\u2019m not your jailor. I\u2019m the one who kept you out of jail. You agreed to the terms of the probation!\u201d\n \u201cLike you agreed to all those terms when you decided to go down to Carson and play nurse?\u201d\n Mom was out of her chair then, and David was out of his, and they stood nose to nose, glaring at each other, and I knew that there was no way we were all going up on Peavine today, because they wouldn\u2019t be able to sit in the same car even if David had wanted to go, even if I\u2019d wanted him there. Nothing David says to Mom ever makes any real sense, but he knows exactly how to get to her. Sometimes he has to keep at it for a while, but Mom always snaps eventually, even if the same thing has happened a million times before. Just like Bobo being scared by something outside, and still going out again when David gave him the chance. David knows exactly how to get people to hurt themselves.\n They were still eye to eye, like cats circling each other before a fight, when the doorbell rang. \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d I said. Maybe it was Letty, and I could warn her about what was happening before she came inside.\n It was a cop. \u201cGood morning, son,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for David. That your brother?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, but my legs felt like wood, and I didn\u2019t seem to be able to get out of the way.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a routine drug test.\u201d\n That was supposed to happen on Fridays. So David had skipped his drug test, too. My stomach shriveled some more. \u201cWill he have to go to jail?\u201d I said. The house would be a lot quieter if David was in jail, but school would be worse. If David went to jail, he\u2019d probably be in the same place as George Flanking and Howard Schuster, and I didn\u2019t want to think too much about that.\n The cop\u2019s face softened. \u201cNo. Not if he\u2019s clean. He\u2019ll get a warning, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n And then Mom, behind me, said, \u201cMichael, let him in,\u201d and my legs came alive and I got out of the doorway, fast, and the cop came in, tipping his hat to Mom.\n \u201cMorning, ma\u2019am.\u201d I wondered if Mom was remembering the last time the cops were at our house. I wondered if this cop was one of her connections. I wonder that about all kinds of people: my teachers and all the cops and storekeepers and Dr. Mills, even. I hate wondering it, but that\u2019s another thing I can\u2019t talk to Mom about. It would just hurt her. It would just make me like David, or like Aunt Tina, who hasn\u2019t even talked to us since Mom started working down in Carson.\n The fight Aunt Tina picked with Mom was as bad as any of David\u2019s: worse, maybe, because she doesn\u2019t even live with us. She wasn\u2019t even here when Dad died. It was none of her business. \u201cOh, Sherry! How can you do that, of all things? With your boys the ages they are, after what their father did? How will be they be able to hold their heads up, knowing\u2014\u201d\n \u201cKnowing that their mother\u2019s keeping a roof over their head? My secretarial job doesn\u2019t pay enough, Tina, not by itself\u2014and if you know what else I can do to earn a hundred thousand a year, go right ahead and tell me!\u201d\n It was perfectly legal, and it would let Mom earn enough money to go to nursing school at UNR and get a job none of us would have to be embarrassed about. That\u2019s what she kept telling us. A year, she\u2019d said, or two at the most. But it had already been two years, and she hadn\u2019t saved enough to quit yet, because the hundred thousand didn\u2019t include food or clothing or insurance, or all the tests Mom has to have to make sure she\u2019s still healthy. She has drug tests, too. She gets more tests than David does, even though she\u2019s not a criminal and never did anything wrong, and she has to pay for all of hers. And when she\u2019s in Carson she can\u2019t go into a casino or a bar by herself, and she can\u2019t be seen in a restaurant with a man, and she has to be registered with the Lyon County Sheriff\u2019s Office\u2014because technically, she\u2019s not in Carson at all. Her job\u2019s not legal in big towns: not in Reno, not in Vegas, not even in lousy little Carson City, the most pathetic excuse for a state capitol you ever saw. Mom has to work right outside Carson, in Lyon County, which is still plenty close enough to be convenient for her connections.\n It used to be that the women at Mom\u2019s job couldn\u2019t even leave the buildings where they work without somebody going with them, but now they have transmitters, instead. And it used to be that they had to work every day for three weeks, living at the job, and then get one week off, but some of them got together and lobbied to change that, because so many of them were single mothers, and they wanted to be able to go home to their kids at night. But they still can\u2019t live in the same county where they work, which is why Mom has to commute between Reno and Carson. Highway 395\u2019s the only way to get down there, and those thirty-five miles can get really bad in the winter. That\u2019s why Mom had to buy the SUV. The SUV wasn\u2019t included in the hundred thousand, either.\n Mom doesn\u2019t know that I know a lot of this. I\u2019ve heard her and Letty talking about it, especially about all the tests. Letty\u2019s afraid Mom\u2019s going to get something horrible and die, but Mom keeps pooh-poohing her. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Letty; it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t have to wear condoms!\u201d\n I got out of the cop\u2019s way and tried not to think about him wearing a condom. It\u2019s hard not to get really mad at Dad whenever I think things like that. It\u2019s hard not to get even madder at David. He has it easier than Mom does, and it\u2019s not fair. She\u2019s not the criminal.\n I followed the cop into the kitchen. Mom was chit-chatting about the weather and pouring him a cup of coffee; David was disappearing down the hall to the bathroom, carrying a little plastic cup. I looked at the drug kit, sitting on the table next to our half-eaten breakfasts. \u201cOnly takes two minutes,\u201d the cop told me, \u201cand then I\u2019ll be out of here and leave you folks to your weekend. Ma\u2019am, you mind if I take my jacket off?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, and he did, and when I saw the gun in its holster I took a step back, even though of course the cop would be wearing a gun, all cops wear guns. Nearly everybody around here owns guns anyway, except us. And Mom bit her lip and the cop stepped back too, away from me, raising his hands. He looked sad.\n \u201cHey, hey, son, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll put the jacket back on.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d I said, my face burning. \u201cI\u2019m going up to my room, anyway.\u201d I wanted to get out of there before David came back out of the bathroom with his precious bodily fluids. I didn\u2019t want to stand around and find out what the drug tests said. So I went upstairs, wondering if there was anybody in the entire fucking town who didn\u2019t know everything about anything that had ever happened to us.\n I flopped down on my bed again, waiting for the jangle of bells that would mean the cop had left. It came pretty quickly, and then there was another right after it, and I didn\u2019t hear any yelling, so I figured everything was okay. The phone had rung, somewhere in there. One of David\u2019s loser friends, maybe. Maybe he\u2019d gone out. Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with him today. I wanted to be out on the mountain, climbing up to Bobo, but I knew the SUV would get there more quickly than I could, even with the delay.\n But when I went back downstairs, David was in the living room watching TV and Mom and Letty were sitting at the kitchen table, looking worried. I looked at Mom and she said, \u201cRelax. Your brother\u2019s clean.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I said. She and Letty had probably been talking about me. \u201cAre we leaving soon?\u201d\n Mom looked down at the table. \u201cMichael, honey, I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t leave right away. I\u2019m waiting for a call from the doctor.\u201d\n I squinted at her. \u201cFrom the doctor?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Mom said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really. She\u2019s looking at some test results, that\u2019s all, and I may need to take some antibiotics. But I don\u2019t want to miss the call. We\u2019ll go right after that, okay?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going now,\u201d I said. I thought they had to wear condoms. \u201cHe\u2019s been up there since last night, Mom!\u201d\n Letty started to stand up. \u201cMike, I\u2019ll drive you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d I said. Right then, as much as I wanted to reach Bobo quickly, I wanted to be alone even more. \u201cYou can catch up with me after the doctor calls. Stay and talk to Mom.\u201d Stay and keep Mom and David out of each other\u2019s hair, I meant, and maybe Letty knew that, because she nodded and sat back down.\n \u201cOkay. We\u2019ll follow you as soon as we can. Be careful.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going.\u201d\n It felt good to be out, away from Mom and David, where I could finally breathe again. I cut over to the wild strip on the edge of our subdivision and started working my way up, past the new construction sites where the dump trucks and jackhammers were roaring away, even on Saturday, up to where all the signs say Bureau of Land Management and National Forest Service. The signs don\u2019t mean much, because the Forest Service and the BLM can sell the land to developers anytime they want. Right now, though, the signs meant that I was on the edge of wildness stretching for miles, all the way to Tahoe.\n When the construction noises faded, I started hearing the gunfire. Shooters come up on Peavine for target practice; you can always find rifle shells on the trails, and there are all kinds of abandoned cars and washing machines and refrigerators that people have hauled up here and shot into Swiss cheese. Sometimes the metal has so many holes you wonder how it holds its shape at all. \u201cRedneck lace,\u201d Dad used to call it\u2014Dad who\u2019d grown up in a trailer, and was so proud that he\u2019d gotten us out of one: Dad who couldn\u2019t stand being called a redneck, even though he came up on Peavine every weekend with George Schuster and Howard Flanking, so they could drink beer and shoot skeet.\n After he died, I couldn\u2019t come up on the mountain for a long time. But gunfire\u2019s one of those things you can\u2019t get away from here, any more than you can avoid new subdivisions, and Peavine\u2019s the only place I can come to be alone, really alone. I can hike up here for hours and never see anybody else. The gunfire\u2019s far away, and nearby are sagebrush and rabbits and hawks. In the summer you see lizards and snakes, and in the winter, in the snow, you see the fresh tracks of deer and antelope. I\u2019ve seen prints that looked like mountain lion; I\u2019ve seen prints that looked like dog, but were probably coyote.\n I hiked hard, pushing myself, taking the steepest trails. It takes me three hours to get to the top of Peavine in good weather, and today I wanted the most direct route I could find. When you\u2019re slogging up a fifteen percent grade in the snow, it\u2019s harder to think about how miserable your cat would be, stuck up here in weather like this, and it\u2019s harder to think about what you want to do to your brother for letting him out. It\u2019s harder to think about who you know might be wearing condoms, or how condoms can break even when they\u2019re used right. It\u2019s harder to think about how angry you are that your mother\u2019s connections don\u2019t have to be tested before she is, to make sure she doesn\u2019t catch anything.\n Mom never lied to me. She wouldn\u2019t say \u201csome antibiotics\u201d if she really meant \u201cyears of AIDS drugs.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t say it was nothing if she was scared she might be infected with something that could kill her. I was angry anyway, because nothing was fair.\n So that fifteen percent grade was just what I needed. If Mom and Letty followed me, they\u2019d be coming the easy way, up the road. They\u2019d probably be angry if they couldn\u2019t find me, but they\u2019d also get to the mine before I did, and they\u2019d be able to drive Bobo back down. I hadn\u2019t been able to bring the carrying case with me, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to get it back down the mountain with Bobo in it anyway, not by myself. I hoped Mom had remembered to put the carrying case in the SUV. I hoped Bobo would still be in any kind of shape to need the carrying case at all.\n I\u2019m sorry, I told him as I climbed. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t come after you sooner. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you from David. I\u2019m sorry about whatever scared you. Bobo, please be alive. Please be okay.\n After a while, it started to snow. I kept going. I was wearing my warmest thermals and I was covered in Gore-Tex, and I had enough food in the pack for three days. And if Mom and Letty drove up in the snow and couldn\u2019t find me because I\u2019d come back down, they\u2019d really start freaking. So I headed on up, except that as soon as I could, I cut over to the road. I didn\u2019t see any fresh tire marks, which meant they were still behind me. I tromped along, checking the GPS every once in a while to make sure the signal hadn\u2019t moved, and then I heard a horn and turned around and saw headlights.\n It was Dr. Mills. \u201cHey, Mike. I drove by your house when I got off work, and your mom said you\u2019d headed up here.\u201d I scrambled into his truck; he had the heater blasting, and it felt good. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that your mom didn\u2019t come. My old truck can take the wear better than that fancy Suburban she has, and there\u2019s only so much room in here.\u201d\n There was still plenty of room in the front seat. I glanced back at the flatbed: Dr. Mills had brought a carrying case, but of course on the way down, we\u2019d want to be able to have Bobo in front with us, where it was warm. The part about Mom could have meant just about anything, depending on whether it was his excuse or hers. If it was hers, she could have been hoping that Dr. Mills would run a male-bonding father-figure trip on me, or she could have still been waiting for the doctor to call, or she and Letty could have been trying to force David to stay in the house somehow. Or all of the above. If it was his\u2014I didn\u2019t want to think about what it meant for him to be saving wear on her SUV, or not wanting her in the truck at all. Dr. Mills is married. I didn\u2019t want to think about him driving down to Carson.\n So I looked at the handheld again. \u201cHe\u2019s in an old mine up here,\u201d I said.\n \u201cMmm-hmmm. That\u2019s what your mom told me. How long since he\u2019s moved?\u201d\n \u201cNot since the satellites came back up,\u201d I said, and Dr. Mills nodded. He stayed quiet for a long time, and finally I said, \u201cYou think he\u2019s dead, don\u2019t you? That\u2019s what Mom thinks.\u201d\n The snow was coming down harder now, the windshield wipers squeaking in a rhythm that kept trying to lull me to sleep. Dr. Mills could have told me he didn\u2019t want to go on; he could have turned around. He didn\u2019t do that. He knew I had to see as much as I could. \u201cMichael,\u201d he said finally, \u201cI\u2019ve been a vet for fifteen years, and I\u2019ve seen plenty of miracles. Animals are amazing. But I have to tell you, I think it would take a miracle for Bobo not to be dead.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice steady.\n \u201cWith coyotes,\u201d he said, \u201cusually it\u2019s quick. They break the necks of their prey, the same as cats do with birds and mice. So unless Bobo got away for a few minutes and then got caught again, he wouldn\u2019t have suffered long.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and looked at my hands. I wondered how long it would take me to break David\u2019s neck, and how much I could make him suffer while I did it. And then I thought, there goes David again, making me want to do something stupid, something that would only mean I was hurting myself.\n It took us ten more minutes to get to the mine, and by then the snow was coming down so hard that we could hardly see a foot ahead of the truck. We got out and started walking towards where the mine should have been, snow stinging our faces. It was really cold. I couldn\u2019t see anything but snow: no rocks, not even the scrubby pines that grow up here. And within about ten feet I realized that the mine entrance was completely buried, and that even if we\u2019d been able to find it, we\u2019d probably need to dig through five feet of snow to get to Bobo.\n \u201cMichael,\u201d Dr. Mills yelled into my ear, over the wind. \u201cMichael, I\u2019m sorry. We have to go back.\u201d\n I tried to say, \u201cI know,\u201d but my voice wouldn\u2019t work. I turned around and headed towards the truck, and when I was back inside it I started shivering, even when the heat was blasting again. I sat in the front seat, with the empty space between me and Dr. Mills where Bobo should have been, and shivered and hugged myself. Finally I said, \u201cYou get warm, just before you freeze to death. If the coyotes didn\u2019t kill him\u2014or if he went up on his own\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s not in pain,\u201d Dr. Mills said. \u201cThat\u2019s a clich\u00e9, isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s true. Michael, wherever he is now, he doesn\u2019t hurt. I can promise you that.\u201d And then he started telling me about some poem called \u201cThe Heaven of Animals,\u201d where the animals remain true to their natures. The predators still hunt and exult over their kill, and their prey rise up again every morning, perfectly renewed, joyously taking their proper part in the chase.\n I guess it\u2019s a nice idea, but all I could think about was Bobo, shivering, hiding his head under my arm because he was scared.\n So we drove on down the mountain, and pretty soon the snow stopped coming down so hard, and when we got back down to the developments, there was hardly any snow at all. You could still hear the construction equipment, and gunfire far off. Maybe the target shooters had moved farther down to get away from the snow. Dr. Mills hadn\u2019t said anything for a while, but when we started hearing the guns, he looked over at me.\n Don\u2019t, I thought. Don\u2019t say it. Don\u2019t say anything. Just take me home, Dr. Mills, please. Don\u2019t say it.\n \u201cI never told you,\u201d he said, very quietly, \u201chow sorry I am about what happened to your dad.\u201d\n I stared straight ahead, thinking about Bobo, thinking about the hiker who\u2019d died on Peavine. I wondered how long it would take the snow to melt.\n When Bobo was a kitten, Dad used to dangle pieces of string for him. He always dangled them just high enough so Bobo couldn\u2019t get at them, and he\u2019d laugh and laugh, watching Bobo jump. \u201cWe\u2019re going to enter this cat in the Olympics,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at him! He must\u2019ve made three feet that time!\u201d\n Bobo had lots of toys he could play with anytime he wanted, balls and catnip mice and crumpled-up pieces of paper I\u2019d toss on the floor for him. But the minute Dad dangled that string, he\u2019d stop playing with the stuff he could catch and go after the thing he couldn\u2019t have.\n \u201cJust like you,\u201d Mom always told him, watching them. \u201cJust like you, Bill, jumping at what you\u2019ll never be able to get.\u201d\n \u201cAw, now, Sherry! Why can\u2019t we have a Lexus? Why can\u2019t we have one of those fancy home theaters, huh?\u201d\n I thought he was kidding. Maybe Mom did, too.\n When Dr. Mills dropped me off at home, David was gone, which was a good thing, because I don\u2019t know what I would have done if I\u2019d had to look at him. Mom and Letty were still there. They tried to talk to me.\n I didn\u2019t want to talk. I went straight up to my room and took off all the Gore-Tex and went to bed. I didn\u2019t want to think about what we didn\u2019t need anymore: the toys and the litter box and Bobo\u2019s food and water bowls. I knew I\u2019d have to throw it all away. Mom had told David he had to get me another cat, but how could I get another cat? David would just let it out again. When I got into bed, I remembered that the handheld was still in my jacket pocket, and somehow that hurt more than anything else. I pulled my pillow over my head and turned my face to the wall. The pillow blocked out a lot, but I still heard the phone, and I still heard the jangling bells when Letty left, and I still heard them again when David came in. I couldn\u2019t block out the sounds of him and Mom yelling at each other, no matter how hard I tried.\n I got up and tried to do homework, but that just made me think about how I was going to have to go to school on Monday morning. I tried to read, but all the words seemed flat and tasteless, like week-old bread. So finally I just sat on my bed, staring out at the casinos. They looked so small from here, little boxes you could pick up and throw like dice. And then I heard a coyote, off in the other direction.\n Being good is one of the smallest boxes there is: Mom knows that, and so do I, and so did Dad. Mom was the only one who never complained about it, but what did I know? Maybe she hated it as much as I did. I didn\u2019t see how she could like it. Maybe she felt like Dad said he\u2019d always felt, like the walls were closing in on her. \u201cIf I could just get outside,\u201d he always told me. \u201cWorking in that damn casino, no daylight anywhere, all those people watching you all the time, you just want to go outside and take a walk, Mike, you know what I mean?\u201d\n After Dr. Mills drove me up to the mine, I knew what Dad meant. I sat there with the walls closing in on me, and I couldn\u2019t breathe. I needed more room. I wanted to be outside with the coyotes, running around the outside of the boxes, invisible. Even if you try to watch a coyote to see what it\u2019s doing, even if you try to track it, it will disappear on you. It will fade into the grass, into the sagebrush, into shadows. And you\u2019ll know that wherever it is, it\u2019s laughing.\n Sunday was quiet. David stayed in front of the TV, and I finally got my homework done, and Mom cleaned the house, humming to herself while she worked. She had to be on antibiotics for ten days, and she couldn\u2019t work until the infection was gone. \u201cTen-day vacation,\u201d she told me cheerfully, but she didn\u2019t get paid vacations any more than she got anything else. All it meant was ten days\u2019 pay out of the nursing-school fund.\n Once I asked her what would happen if the Lyon County sheriff\u2019s office saw her transmitter signal outside the building where she works. What if they tracked it and found her in a bar, or in a casino, or in a restaurant with a man? Would she go to jail?\n She\u2019d shaken her head and said very gently, \u201cNo, honey, I\u2019d just lose my job. And I\u2019d never do that, because it would be stupid.\u201d Because it would be like what Dad did, she meant. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n When I got up on Monday morning, my stomach hurt already. I hadn\u2019t been able to sleep very well, because I kept thinking about Bobo buried in the snow. I kept wondering about what I hadn\u2019t been able to see, worrying that maybe there\u2019d been some way to save him and I hadn\u2019t figured it out.\n I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of going to school. I couldn\u2019t stand facing Johnny and Leon; I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of going through all that and not being able to come home and have Bobo comfort me, curling up on my stomach the way he always did to get warm. I\u2019d always been able to tell Bobo everything I couldn\u2019t talk about to anybody else, and now he was gone.\n But I had to go to school, so I wouldn\u2019t upset Mom.\n I had an algebra test first period. I knew the material; I could have done all the problems, but I couldn\u2019t make my hands move. I just sat there and stared at the paper, and when Mrs. Ogilvy called time, I handed it in blank.\n She looked at it, and both her eyebrows went up. \u201cMichael?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014Michael, are you sick? Do you want to go to the nurse?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, and walked away, out into the hall, to my next class, which was English. We were talking about Julius Caesar. I sat against the back wall and fell asleep, and when the bell rang I got up and went to Biology, where we were dissecting frogs. Biology was always bad, because Johnny and Leon were in there. They grabbed the lab station next to mine, and whenever they thought they could get away with it they whispered, \u201cHey, Mike, know what we\u2019re gonna do after school? Hey, Mike\u2014we\u2019re gonna drive down to Carson. We\u2019re gonna drive down to Carson and fuck your mother!\u201d\n Donna Mauro, my lab partner, said, \u201cThey are such jerks.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, but I couldn\u2019t even look at Donna, because I was too ashamed. I knew everybody in school knew what my mother did, but that didn\u2019t mean I liked it when Johnny and Leon reminded them. I wondered if one of Donna\u2019s parents worked for the BLM and had talked to Letty, but it could have been just about anybody.\n I stared down at the frog. We were supposed to be looking for the heart. I pretended it was Johnny instead, and sliced off a leg. Then I pretended it was Leon, and sliced off the other leg.\n Donna just watched me. \u201cUm, Mike? What are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cI thought I\u2019d have frog legs for lunch,\u201d I said. My voice sounded weird to me, tinny. \u201cWant one?\u201d\n \u201cUm\u2014Mike, that\u2019s cool, but we have to find the heart now.\u201d\n I handed her the scalpel. \u201cHere. You find the heart.\u201d\n And then I turned and walked away.\n It was really easy, actually. I just walked out of the room, like I had to go to the bathroom but had forgotten to ask permission. Behind me I could hear Mr. Favaro, our teacher, saying something, and Donna answering, but the voices didn\u2019t really reach me. I felt like I was inside a bubble: I could see outside, but everything was muffled, and no one could get inside. They\u2019d just bounce off.\n It was wonderful.\n I walked along the hall, and Mr. Favaro ran up behind me, gabbling something. I had to listen really carefully to make out what he was saying. It sounded like he was on the moon. \u201cMike? Michael? Is there something you need to tell me?\u201d\n I considered this. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. If I\u2019d been Leon or Johnny or one of the bad kids, Mr. Favaro probably would have yelled at me and told me to get back inside the room, now, but he was spooked because it was me acting this way. So he gabbled some more, and I ignored him, and finally he ran away in the other direction, towards the principal\u2019s office.\n I just walked out the door. My jacket was back in my locker, but it was pretty warm out, at least in the sun, and I wasn\u2019t cold. The bubble kept me warm. I started walking down a gully that angled down past the football field. I could hear voices behind me; I didn\u2019t stop to try to figure out what they were saying. But then a van pulled up alongside the gully, and people got out, and the voices started again. \u201cMichael. Michael Michael Michael Michael Michael.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d I said. Ms. Dellafield was there, the principal, and Mr. Ambrose, the school nurse, and two guidance counselors whose names I could never remember. They all looked really scared. I blinked at them. \u201cI just wanted to take a walk,\u201d I said, but they were in a semicircle around me, pushing at the edges of the bubble, herding me towards the van. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d I told them. \u201cReally. I\u2019m fine. I was just taking a walk.\u201d\n They didn\u2019t listen. They kept herding me towards the van, and then I was inside it, and the door was closing.\n They drove me back to school, and then they herded me into Mr. Ambrose\u2019s office, and then Ms. Dellafield went to call Mom while Mr. Ambrose and the two guidance counselors stood there and watched me, like they were going to tackle me if I tried to move. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d I kept asking them. \u201cI was just going for a walk.\u201d It didn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019d seen other kids walk out of classes: they\u2019d never gotten this kind of attention. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to biology, okay? I\u2019ll dissect my frog. You don\u2019t have to call my mother!\u201d\n And at the same time I thought, thank God Mom\u2019s home today. Thank God she\u2019s not down in Carson, so that Ms. Dellafield doesn\u2019t have to hear them say whatever they say when they answer the phone there, not that there\u2019s any chance that Ms. Dellafield doesn\u2019t know where Mom works, since everybody else knows it. But even all that didn\u2019t bother me as much as usual, because the bubble was still basically holding. Mr. Ambrose and the guidance counselors kept asking me how I was, and I kept telling them I was fine, thank you, and how are all of you today? And they kept looking more and more worried, as if I\u2019d answered them in another language, one where \u201cfine\u201d meant \u201cmy eyeballs are about to explode.\u201d So I sat there feeling fine, if a little far away, and thinking, these people are really weird.\n And finally, after about half an hour, I heard voices outside Mr. Ambrose\u2019s office, and then the door opened and Mom came in. She was leaning on David. David had his arm around her, and he was really pale. It was the same way he\u2019d looked after he pulled me away from the rattlesnake.\n I squinted at him and said, \u201cWhat are you doing here? What happened?\u201d\n \u201cShe called me,\u201d David said. He sounded like he was choking. \u201cAt work. When they called her. So we could come over here together.\u201d\n I looked at Mom. She was crying, and then I got really scared. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I said. \u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay? Did something happen to Letty?\u201d Maybe Mom had called Ms. Dellafield and said something had happened and they had to find me. But that wouldn\u2019t explain the van and the guidance counselors, would it? If something had happened to Letty, wouldn\u2019t Mom have driven over here to tell me herself?\n Everybody just stared at me. Mom stopped crying, and wiped her eyes, and said very quietly, \u201cMichael, the question is, are you okay?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m fine! Why does everybody keep asking me that? I was just going for a walk! Why doesn\u2019t anybody believe me?\u201d\n And Mom started crying again and David shook his head and said, \u201cOh, you stupid\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDavid.\u201d Ms. Dellafield sounded very tired. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n I felt like I was going crazy. \u201cWould somebody please tell me what\u2019s going on? I was just\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMichael,\u201d Mom said, \u201cthat\u2019s what your father said, too.\u201d\n I blinked. The room had gotten impossibly quiet, as if nobody else was even breathing. Mom said, \u201cHe said he was just going for a walk, and then he went out into the yard. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d\n I looked away from all of them, out the window. I didn\u2019t remember that. I didn\u2019t remember anything that had happened that day, before the shot. It didn\u2019t matter: everyone else at school knew the story, and they\u2019d remembered it for me. \u201cI really was just going for a walk,\u201d I said, and then, \u201cI don\u2019t even have a gun.\u201d\n Ms. Dellafield said I should take the rest of the day off, so Mom and David and I drove home together, in David\u2019s jeep. When Ms. Dellafield called Mom at home, Mom had been too upset even to drive, so she\u2019d called David and he\u2019d left work and picked her up and driven her to school. He drove us all home, too. He drove really carefully. Once a squirrel ran into the road and David slowed down until it got out of his way. I\u2019d never seen him drive like that before. And when we were walking into the house, Mom tripped, and David reached out to steady her.\n The last time I\u2019d seen Mom and David leaning on each other, they\u2019d been coming in from the yard. I remembered that part. My ears had still been ringing, but Letty wouldn\u2019t let me go, no matter how hard I fought. She\u2019d been eating lunch with us when it happened. \u201cLet me see,\u201d I kept telling her, trying to break free. \u201cLet me go out there! I want to see what happened!\u201d\n But Letty wouldn\u2019t let go, because the first thing that happened after the shot was that Mom and David ran out into the yard, and David started screaming, and then Mom yelled at Letty, \u201cKeep Michael inside! Don\u2019t let him come out here!\u201d\n And they came back inside, and Mom called the police, and I kept saying, \u201cI want to go see,\u201d and David kept shaking his head and saying, \u201cNo you don\u2019t, Michael, you don\u2019t want to see this, you really don\u2019t,\u201d and Letty wouldn\u2019t let go of me. And the cops came and asked everybody questions, and then Letty took me to her house, and by the time I got home, Mom and David had cleaned up the backyard, picked up all the little pieces of bone and brain, so that there was nothing left to see at all.\n Dad was stupid. You can\u2019t beat the house: anybody who\u2019s ever been anywhere near a casino knows that. But he and George and Howard were trying. They\u2019d worked out a system, the newspaper said; George or Howard, never both at once, would go in and play at Dad\u2019s table, and Dad would touch a cheek or scratch an ear, always a different signal, so they\u2019d know when to double their bets. And then when they won, they\u2019d split the take with him. They tried to be smart. They didn\u2019t do it very often, but it was often enough for the pit bosses and the cameras to catch on. And somehow, when Dad came home that day, he knew he\u2019d been caught. He knew the walls were closing in.\n George and Howard went to jail. I guess Dad knew he\u2019d have to go there too. I guess he thought that was just too small a box.\n Nobody said anything for a long time, after we got home from school. Mom started unloading the dishwasher, moving in little jerks like somebody in an old silent movie, and David sat down at the kitchen table, and I went to the fridge and got a drink of juice. And finally David said, \u201cWhy the hell did you do that?\u201d\n He didn\u2019t sound angry, or like he was trying to piss me off. He just sounded lost. And I hadn\u2019t been trying to do anything; I\u2019d just been going for a walk, but I\u2019d said that at least a million times by now and it was no good. Nobody believed me, or nobody cared. So instead I said, \u201cWhy did you keep letting Bobo out?\u201d\n And Mom, with her back to us, stopped moving; she stood there, holding a plate, looking down at the open dishwasher. And David said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Mom turned and looked at him, then, and I looked at Mom. David never admitted there was anything he didn\u2019t know. He stared down at the table and said, \u201cYou kept saying you wanted to go outside. You kept\u2014you were fighting to go outside. The cat wanted to go out, Michael. He did.\u201d He looked up, straight at me; his chin was trembling. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even have to look at it. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d\n His voice sounded much younger, then, and I flashed back on that day when he saved me from the rattlesnake, when we were still friends, and all of a sudden my bubble burst and I was back in the world, where it hurt to breathe, where the air against my skin felt like sandpaper. \u201cSo you wanted me to get my wish by having to look at Bobo?\u201d I said. \u201cIs that it? Like I wanted any of it to happen, you fuckhead? Like\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShhhh,\u201d Mom said, and came over and hugged me. \u201cShhhh. It\u2019s all right now. It\u2019s all right. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. David\u2014\u201d\n \u201cForget it,\u201d David said. \u201cNone of it matters anymore, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cYes it does,\u201d Mom said. \u201cDavid, I made you do too much. I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI want to go for a walk now,\u201d I said. I was going to scream if I couldn\u2019t get outside; I was going to scream or break something. \u201cCan we just go for a walk? All of us? You can watch me, okay? I promise not to do anything stupid. Please?\u201d\n Mom and David have gotten along a lot better since then. Letty and I talked about it, once. She said they\u2019d probably been fighting so much because David was mad at Mom for making him help her in the yard when Dad died, and Mom felt guilty about it, and didn\u2019t even know she did, and kept lashing out at him. And none of us were talking about anything, so it festered. Letty said that what I did at school that day was exactly what I needed to do to remind Mom and David how much they could still lose, to make them stop being mad at each other. And I told her I hadn\u2019t been trying to do anything, and anyway I hadn\u2019t even remembered what Dad had said before he went out into the yard. She said it didn\u2019t matter. It was instinct, she said. She said people still have instincts, even when they live in boxes, and that we can\u2019t ever lose them completely, not if we\u2019re still alive at all. Look at Bobo, she told me. You got him from a pet store. He\u2019d never even lived outside, but he still wanted to get out. He still knew he was supposed to be hunting mice.\n In June, when the snow melted from the top of Peavine, I hiked back up to the mine. I\u2019d been back on the mountain before that, of course, but I hadn\u2019t gone up that high: maybe because I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything yet, maybe because I was afraid I would. But that Saturday I woke up, and it was sunny and warm, and Mom and David were both at work, and I thought, okay. This is the day. I\u2019ll go up there by myself, to see. To say goodbye.\n All those months, the transmitter signal hadn\u2019t moved.\n So I hiked up, past the developments, through rocks and sagebrush, scattering basking lizards. I saw a few rabbits and a couple of hawks, and I heard gunfire, but I didn\u2019t see any people.\n When I got to the mine, I peered inside and couldn\u2019t see anything. I\u2019d brought a flashlight, but it\u2019s dangerous to go inside abandoned mines. Even if it\u2019s safe to breathe the air, even if you don\u2019t get trapped, you don\u2019t know what else might be in there with you. Snakes. Coyotes.\n So I shone the flashlight inside and looked for anything that might have been a cat once. There were dirt and rocks, but I couldn\u2019t even see anything that looked like bones. The handheld said this was the place, though, so I scrabbled around in the dirt a little bit, and played the flashlight over every surface the beam would reach, and finally, maybe two feet inside the mine, I saw something glinting in a crevice in the rock.\n It was the chip: just the chip, a tiny little piece of silver circuitry, sitting there all by itself. Maybe there\u2019d been bones too, for a while, and something had carried them off. Or maybe something had eaten Bobo and left a pile of scat here, with the chip in it, and everything had gone back into the ground except the chip. I don\u2019t know. All I knew was that Bobo was gone, and I still missed him, and there wasn\u2019t even anything that had been him to bring back with me.\n I sat there and looked at the chip for a while, and then I put the handheld next to it. And then I went and sat on a rock outside the mine, in the sun.\n It was pretty. There were wildflowers all over the place, and you could see for miles. And I sat there and thought, I could just leave. I could just walk away, walk in the other direction, clear to Tahoe, walk away from all the boxes. I don\u2019t have a transmitter. Nobody would know where I was. I could walk as long as I wanted.\n But there are boxes everywhere, aren\u2019t there? Even at Tahoe, maybe especially at Tahoe, where all the rich people build their fancy houses. And if I walked away, Mom and David wouldn\u2019t know where I was. They wouldn\u2019t even have a transmitter signal. And I knew what that felt like. I remembered staring at the dark screen, when the satellites were offline. I remembered staring at it, and trying not to cry, and praying. Please, Bobo, come back home. Please come back, Bobo. I love you.\n So I sat there for a while, looking out over the city. And then I ate an energy bar and drank some water, and headed back down the mountain, back home.\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine, May 2000.\n Susan Palwick is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno.

When the dinosaur uprising overwhelmed the factory, he used a hunting rifle to drop two great beasts that got in his way. He climbed over their corpses and fled deeper into the factory, toward the shuttle launch silos\u2014but he was too late. The six shuttles were gone. Only their exhaust remained, suffusing the air.\nA Lei shouted a torrent of abuse at his faithless coworkers. The racket of a collapsing assembly line drowned out his obscenities. A dinosaur more than five meters long jumped in front of him. He fired his rifle from the hip, but the creature nimbly evaded. The shot pierced a cooling pipe, and liquid nitrogen sprayed in torrents of white mist. The dinosaur\u2019s movements slowed. A Lei squeezed the trigger again, but nothing happened. He was out of ammo. He abandoned the weapon, turned, and fled.\nHe squeezed between two silos, the gap only a meter wide and about fifteen deep. This nook had survived countless launch-shock waves, never collapsing. It would temporarily shelter him from this dinosaur sneak attack. Now he needed a weapon, but all he found was canned dinosaur meat scattered about. He had no choice but to snatch a few cans. It was better than being empty-handed.\nA pair of lantern-like eyes appeared at the gap entrance. The crimson eyes fixed on A Lei, making his scalp tingle, and heavy breathing filled his ears. The beast struck at a silo wall, long mouth clamping down, sharp teeth piercing, and a metal wall plate came off with the sound of a gunshot. A monstrous tooth landed near A Lei\u2019s foot. The canine, as long as his hand, stank of blood and made him retch.\nThe monster withdrew a few steps, swaying its large head. It peered into the gap at A Lei, seemingly loathe to abandon him. He saw it clearly now: a draconis sapiens over five meters long, from the largest-bodied dromaeosauridae branch, fast and deadly, cousin to the famous velociraptor, but with a much higher IQ. Some had brain volumes comparable to humans. They set traps and imitated other species to attract prey. Some witnesses claimed they emulated human tool use, and even parroted human speech. This was the most dangerous species of dinosaur. Almost every time livestock rebelled, dracopiens were involved. Their delicious flesh was widely known. At every supermarket counter in the Starship Alliance, dracopien was the most popular meat. Their weighty brains were used to make Dragon Brain Soup, a delicacy to rival Shark Fin or Swallow\u2019s Nest.\nThis dracopien wore a fine necklet. The inlaid nameplate identified its master, the researcher Ai Li-ke, and below that the creature\u2019s name, Steel Teeth.\nIt turned and moved off, seeming to give up. A Lei\u2019s sigh of relief was cut short when the monster picked up a hoisting jack and returned. It placed the jack in the gap and leisurely cranked, widening the entrance, metal squealing and giving way.\nA Lei grew desperate and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t bother! I\u2019m just skin and bones, not tasty at all!\u201d\nSteel Teeth\u2019s throat rumbled ominously. In crude tones it said, \u201cI just ate a few. Humans really do taste awful. And I am full. That is not why I am doing this. It is exercise. Is that not a good enough reason?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t surprising that this dracopien could talk. In addition to its developed brain and formidable intelligence, its larynx anatomy closely resembled a parrot\u2019s.\nIt showed no sign of stopping with the jack. A Lei\u2019s fight-or-flight impulse kicked in. He made his way into a deeper, narrower place. \u201cSo you\u2019re full,\u201d he said, squeezing in. \u201cWe might as well sit down and chat. Maybe even make friends?\u201d\nSteel Teeth\u2019s strength was extraordinary. After the jack had done its work, the monster bit its way forward, as if burning excess vigor, tearing away pipes and wires, clawing apart metal plating. A Lei crawled further in, frantic and ratlike, relying on memory to seek the butchering-mecha storage facility.\nHe crawled out of a ruptured industrial runoff pipe. Less than three meters away reclined a mecha suit, a butchering model about the size of a dracopien. The cockpit was open. The suit, which might have held its own against a T.Rex, had been abandoned. He had no time for this mystery. Rousing his courage, he took a deep breath and charged toward the armor. The foul stench of industrial runoff was like a chemical weapon, nearly overwhelming him. He covered his nose and reached for the mecha.\nThe runoff pipe was trampled flat with a thunderous crash. Steel Teeth\u2019s talons stabbed the floor right in front of A Lei. They could disembowel a T.Rex, and they\u2019d come centimeters from tearing open his throat. Steel Teeth was like a cat toying with a mouse. Such a nimble killing machine couldn\u2019t miss like that. If it wanted A Lei dead, he\u2019d already be slashed to ribbons.\nA primal ferocity stirred in A Lei\u2019s heart. He dove into the cockpit. An impact rocked the canopy, Steel Teeth\u2019s claw a step late, screeching across the transparent shell. A Lei was soaked in cold sweat. He\u2019d nearly been decapitated.\nNow ensconced in the mecha, A Lei felt a dangerous pride. To suppress dinosaur uprisings, many mecha packed serious firepower, six-barrel Gatling machine cannons. He pulled a joystick. The mecha shivered, stood, extended manipulator arms toward the dracopien. Panels opened on the arms. A Lei cackled in his pride, eager to blow Steel Teeth to pieces.\nBut his smile froze.\nHis new arms were not sprouting cannons like he\u2019d hoped. Instead, meter-long soup ladles emerged. He threw switches, retracting the ladles, extending giant tongs. A Lei stared, dumbfounded, switching tools in a frenzy. Forks, hooks, egg whisks, and other implements came up in succession, like a rotating lantern-carousel of paper horses. Against all reason, there was nothing like a useful weapon. Steel Teeth saw his frustration and collapsed with hissing laughter. \u201cYou foolish thing!\u201d it said. \u201cIf this mecha had weapons, why would its former master have abandoned it?\u201d\nA Lei saw his chance and took it. He drove the mecha, trampling over the prone dinosaur and charged at a window. He smashed through, leaping out of the 045 Meat Union factory. Then he was falling, crashing through canopies of massive treelike ferns, more than twenty meters down, and into flea-bitten mud.\n2\nThe Starship Alliance was nicknamed \u201cThe Foodie Federation\u201d because its citizens had long ago grown dissatisfied with dull, flavorless foodstuffs synthesized in labs. Like their distant ancestors, they craved natural, pollution-free food, meat from species that grazed over vast territories, organically. The foodies were insatiable. They wanted exquisite variety, minced delicacies, food that took ten or even a hundred times more energy to raise and prepare than it provided. Such uneconomical practices were rare among nomadic space civilizations. To feed their strange addiction, the foodies constructed specialized agricultural starships. These immense man-made worlds provided grazing land, artificial sunlight, fertile soil, whole biospheres in the service of the foodies\u2019 appetite. All kinds of crops and livestock were raised, under natural Earthlike conditions. The yield was harvested or slaughtered after maturation, sent by freighter to every starship with megacities, to restaurants and supermarkets, meeting the demands of countless gluttons.\nA few hundred years ago, the Starship Alliance returned to its origin world, Earth, seeking the fragments of its ancestral civilization. They took nearly everything of value from the ruins: cultural relics, dilapidated landmarks, specimens of flora and fauna, and fossils of extinct organisms. The dinosaur fossil payload came to megatons, and included many previously undiscovered species. Among the latter was the astonishing draconis sapiens.\nBiologists conceived an idea: create a starship with a Cretaceous Earth habitat, resurrect paleo-organisms, including dinosaurs, so as to research the era. But the cost of the project would be massive. It wasn\u2019t easy to persuade stingy legislators to allocate funds, but after many rejections, they found someone who was interested.\n\u201cJust leave it to me,\u201d said the Venerable Madam Zheng Qingyin, president of the Alliance Foodstuffs Federation\u2014in business circles known as Grandma Foodie\u2014leaning on her dragon head cane in the Bio Research Institute\u2019s paleo-organism department.\nAn astonishing foodie carnival was staged at that year\u2019s congressional budget conference. AFF freighters crowded the Congressional Plaza. \u201cDistinctive Prehistoric Delicacies\u201d were handed out, free of charge. AFF-owned celebrities performed on stage. Billboards shouted slogans:\n\u201cMake any dinner table more sumptuous!\u201d\n\u201cT.Rex leg burgers, steamed diplodocus, savory and spicy pterosaur wings!\u201d\n\u201cTake your place at the Starship Alliance\u2019s luxurious banquet table!\u201d\nThe Venerable Madam Zheng, white-haired, ruddy-complexioned, hale and hearty, walked with vigorous strides into the Capitol Building, deploying her dragon head cane to great dramatic effect. She carried a draft resolution in her other hand. She didn\u2019t use lengthy speeches to subjugate the legislators. Instead, she made sure they each had samples of dinosaur meat to try. When the few vegetarian legislators furrowed their brows and refused, she tantalized them with an equally delicious ancient pteridophyte banquet.\nThe Capitol Building had become a mansion of delicacies.\n\u201cI won\u2019t lecture you,\u201d the Venerable Madam said, \u201con the importance of a diverse diet to human well-being. There\u2019s no need, am I right?\u201d\nHer scientists were arrayed behind her, ready to hold forth on the topic for months, if called upon. She\u2019d prepared truckloads of technical data on the proposed starship and its Cretaceous habitat. Its cost would dwarf that of traditional agricultural ships. It would allow biologists to research extinct life, but of course this was really about the foodies, and eating.\nShe got through the proposal effortlessly. When she emerged at the top of the Capitol steps, smiling and satisfied, a multitude of gluttons erupted with applause. Alliance TV broadcasted everything. The Venerable Madam had been wild in her youth. Now she felt that old wantonness return. Raising her dragon head cane, she cried, \u201cOur slogan is . . . !\u201d\nThe crowded square gave its booming reply: \u201cEat everything on two legs except people! Eat everything on four legs except stools!\u201d\nBuilding the new starship would take over a hundred years. Grandma Foodie Zheng Qingyin wouldn\u2019t live to see it completed, but her draft resolution would profoundly change the Starship Alliance dining table. After DNA fragments had been extracted, and paleo-organisms were coming back to life species by species, scientists noted that dracopiens were intelligent organisms. There was extensive debate: the resurrection of a dinosaur with human-equivalent IQ was no small matter. But in the end, the foodies\u2019 argument was simple and persuasive: Are dracopiens delicious? If so, resurrect!\n3\nThe Cretaceous habitat was wildly unsuitable for humans. The world outside the factories was verdant, a wetland teeming with reptiles. People accidentally stepped on crocodiles and other beasts quite often. Dense fern canopies blotted out sky and sun. This primeval forest was bathed in a luxuriant mist, and the air, at over forty Celsius, was suffocating. It was like being in a giant food steamer. The pteridophyte fauna, lacking the structure and root systems of woody plants, needed the moist surroundings to survive. Some of the treelike ferns reached thirty meters tall. This world was so saturated that living people could molder.\nA Lei made his mecha sit up. Luckily the interior was climate controlled, or he would already have been steam-cooked by the atmosphere. He hadn\u2019t driven a few steps before the mecha slipped into a bog, and he had to get upright again, this time with difficulty. This factory mecha was not suited to Cretaceous mud.\nA Lei glanced back at the factory, which resembled a massive spider, several hundred meters wide, lying sprawled upon the earth. Normally it advanced like a bulldozer, gobbling up fern forest. Ground effect vehicles, like great dragonflies, would be dispatched from their tarmac on the roof, and in great swarms hunt dinosaurs. The conveyor belts would hurtle forward continuously, processing all kinds of dinosaur meat products. There were many of these roving factories in starship Rhea. The fern forests grew fast and weed-like in the warm, moist environment, and could be harvested regularly. The tender pteridophytes were rich in carbohydrates and protein. Most of a pteridophyte was edible, unlike flowering plants with their limited offerings of fruits, seeds, and certain leaves. The stunningly fast growth of Cretaceous flora was a clear demonstration to scientists of how the colossi, the dinosaurs, had been fed. Gourmands were pleasantly surprised at how fast the dinosaurs reproduced in this blistering climate\u2014so much for the assumption of slow reptilian birthrates. Brood after enormous brood, breeding faster than rats: it turned out that Rhea was twice as productive as traditional agricultural starships. It seemed dinosaurs wouldn\u2019t have to be domesticated. Hunting was sufficient.\nAs A Lei carefully observed his surroundings, Steel Teeth rushed down the nearly-vertical factory wall and dashed across fern roots and muck, leaving no trace. A Lei was reminded of its awful cousin, the swift and violent velociraptor, and he failed to react. It felt like a hundred-ton truck hit him. His mecha was like a kite with its string cut, airborne, beyond control, then crashing through tree-fern saplings\u2014and finally, mecha-face down in the mire.\nSteel Teeth\u2019s talons pressed down on the machine. Its teeth scraped, seeking purchase, but it couldn\u2019t get the cockpit open. It gave up grudgingly. A Lei came to, feeling like all his bones had been shattered. Luckily, he\u2019d landed in spongy marshland. If it had been solid stone, he might have been crushed inside the mecha.\nSteel Teeth had been slower in the factory, where it was 20 or so degrees Celsius. Although dinosaurs were considered warm blooded, their capacity for body temperature regulation was inferior to that of mammals and birds. Out here in the damp heat, at over 40 degrees, it was ideal dinosaur weather. Below 10 degrees, most dinosaurs lost their mobility, or even died en masse.\nA Lei sat the mecha up, and again Steel Teeth knocked it down. A Lei raised both hands and said, \u201cOkay buddy. We\u2019re both intelligent creatures. How about we sit down for a nice chat?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steel Teeth replied. It was at its wit\u2019s end, after all. The mecha was a conundrum. The last attack had consumed the dinosaur\u2019s strength, and it needed a rest, just like A Lei. It sat down much like a hen, stomach to the ground. The dinosaur kinship with birds was plain.\n\u201cYou seem familiar with humans,\u201d A Lei said. \u201cSurely you were raised and trained by someone . . . \u201d\nThe creature said, \u201cMy foster father Ai Li-ke was a researcher of extinct life, living in solitude. He gave me human knowledge.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what happened to him?\u201d\nSteel Teeth laughed, displaying its keen incisors. \u201cHe was not very good. His meat was old. Too many bones. Hurt my teeth.\u201d\nA Lei was shocked. \u201cYou ate him?\u201d\n\u201cHumans have strange defects,\u201d Steel Teeth said. \u201cYou like domesticating house pets, believing you can imbue them with human feelings and reason. With dogs, horses, and other such social animals, long domestication can render them docile. But as for solitary animals . . . no matter how good you are to me, good enough to make me see you as kin, well, one mountain cannot brook two tigers. And we kill our own kind. The mother snake lays a brood and then just leaves. The eggs hatch and the young must fend for themselves. There is no familial emotion or attachment in the snake brain, no sense of friendship. How can you domesticate that? Change fundamental brain structure? No matter how good you are to creatures like us, we only see you as prey.\u201d\nThis great reptile\u2019s words resonated with A Lei. It seemed the dracopien, for all its mental development, was no more affectionate or friendly than a snake. A Lei said, \u201cI\u2019ve never met such a wise and farsighted dinosaur.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Steel Teeth said, lying prostrate on the ground. \u201cYou can call me Mister Wise and Farsighted Crouching Dragon.\u201d\n4\nGetting rid of this dracopien wasn\u2019t going to be easy. It became clear to A Lei as he watched the beast kill a T.Rex. Steel Teeth cleverly enraged its prey, luring the massive creature into soft mud, where it became stuck, and the hunter easily prevailed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d A Lei said. \u201cYour kind is quite rare, for a late Cretaceous apex predator. We\u2019ve found so many T.Rex fossils, but few dracopien fossils. Actually, we found none until the SA returned to Earth.\u201d\nSteel Teeth bit off a chunk of T.Rex flesh and devoured it. \u201cWe dracopiens do not lay many eggs. And we like to kill each other, so our numbers are naturally low. But, I have a dream. I see a great dinosaur civilization. I see dracopiens destroying humanity, and replacing it.\u201d\nA dinosaur with a dream: this was a day of firsts for A Lei. He chose to dampen the creature\u2019s enthusiasm: \u201cEstablishing a civilization isn\u2019t easy. Mastering fire would be step one. We\u2019ve never found a trace of fire production from the dinosaur age. Can you friction-drill?\u201d\nSteel Teeth lifted its head and gazed about. The dense fern forest hid much of the sky, while enveloping fog made a salted egg yoke of the westering sun. The dracopien leapt up, and came down on a tree fern, smashing it to the ground. It seized half the trunk in its mouth and flung it before A Lei. \u201cDrill for fire?\u201d it said, in a rage. \u201cWith this saturated fern material, in this saturated world, show me fire-drilling! Suirenshi, last of the Three August Ones, legendary inventor of fire, would be at his wit\u2019s end in this place!\u201d\nA Lei had stepped on Steel Teeth\u2019s tail with this problem of fire. Lack of fire production was dinosaur evolution\u2019s biggest flaw. Humans had come into the universe a mere three-million years ago, while draconis sapiens, from birth to asteroid strike, may have been around a good deal longer, yet never mastered flame. They never expanded their food options with cooking, or smelted metal, or created advanced tools. There had never been a dinosaur civilization.\nA Lei\u2019s stomach growled as he sat in the cockpit and watched Steel Teeth gorge itself.\nHe drove the mecha, stepping away, but the beast leapt and knocked him down. After several thwarted attempts, A Lei knew he was trapped. He was meant to starve here. \u201cYou said your dream was to replace us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut do you understand human civilization?\u201d\n\u201cI understand a bit,\u201d it said. \u201cWe have gathered much data on humans.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you comprehend it all?\u201d\nThe beast cocked its head. \u201cMost of it . . . no.\u201d\n\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have eaten your foster father. He would have been happy to help, I imagine.\u201d\n\u201cJust so. I immediately regretted it, after devouring him.\u201d\nA Lei finally understood. A dracopien\u2019s appetite overrode its rational faculty. Having eaten its fill, reason returned. When its belly growled, it became an unthinking, ferocious beast. A Lei saw an opportunity. \u201cYou must be in dire need of someone who understands human civilization. If I may be so bold, I could fill that role. I could help you decipher what you mean to annihilate.\u201d\nSteel Teeth returned to the factory and went inside. It soon returned, carrying a flamethrower. It was impossible to friction-drill in this moist world, but a flamethrower was another matter. A Lei watched the dracopien roast the T.Rex meat, puzzled. This sort of carnivore didn\u2019t normally like cooked meat.\nSteel Teeth tossed a well-done T.Rex leg in front of the mecha. It opened its bloody, fearsome mouth and said, \u201cYou are welcome to join us.\u201d\n\u201cUs? There are others?\u201d A Lei cautiously opened the canopy as the mecha forked a fragrant chunk of meat and brought it up.\nSteel Teeth looked up and gave a long, ominous roar that made the ground tremble. Moments later, a group of dracopiens emerged into view. Steel Teeth extended its arms and said, \u201cWelcome to the Steel Teeth tribe.\u201d\n5\nThe dracopiens had always tried to imitate human civilization. Rhea employees talked about this often enough.\nA Lei came to the so-called Steel Teeth tribe\u2019s home, a simple, crude structure hidden between a mountain range and a river. On the doorway was an upside-down sign: \u201cAi Li-ke, Research Facility.\u201d Steel Teeth had seized the place and turned it into a fortress. The surrounding area was piled with hewn-down tree ferns. It seemed the dracopiens had meant to build a stockade with them, but they\u2019d found the material too flexible and abandoned the project. They\u2019d hunted down large dinosaur skeletons instead, using a mixture of stone and bone to construct a gruesome and intimidating city wall.\nA Lei knew that primitive human tribes had built enclosing walls to repel wild beast incursions. He didn\u2019t understand why apex predators like dracopiens needed such protection. Perhaps they were just imitating human behavior. Tree fern shanties stood here and there between the wall and the lab, a solemn little primeval town. The dracopiens had learned the human concept of shelter, but not human construction standards. The shacks were made of broad tree fern stalks and leaves. The roofs were slapdash, barely qualifying as shelter. Still, these dracopiens were far more advanced than other dinosaurs. Some gathered in front of huts to polish hunting implements. From a technological perspective, the tools were close to human Neolithic level, but they weren\u2019t made of stone. Discarded human machine parts served instead\u2014machine arms from dismantled factories, iron pipes, and the like, all ground down to points and made into javelins, lances, and other primitive weapons.\nThere were many such primitive tribes in starship Rhea. Although Cretaceous era dracopiens had humanlike IQs, they\u2019d never entered the tribal era on Earth. These tribes in Rhea had clearly resulted from human influence. All kinds of plundered posters covered the fort, many of them SA city scenes, or steampunk-style space factories, and wide shots of spacecraft swarms like stellar multitudes. But most were illustrations of delicacies from various SA regions. On each of these, a graffito had been scrawled, in characters like roaches crawling across the image: \u201cOur goal is a sea of food!\u201d\n\u201cI thought your goal was to destroy human civilization,\u201d A Lei said, \u201cto remove and replace us.\u201d\n\u201cJust so, but our ultimate goal is to eat. Humanity has many tasty delicacies. My foster father used to share them with me, fine foods from other starships, even from alien civilizations. For the sake of gourmet dining, humans have spanned thousands of lightyears, and returned to Earth to excavate fossils. You made this Cretaceous environment, this high-quality grazing land . . . the audacity! Foodies are the most powerful force in the universe. If we conquer humanity, all that wonderful food will be ours!\u201d\nIn the final analysis, these dracopiens were mouth-straight-to-heart foodies. Steel Teeth did nothing to conceal its yearning. A Lei hadn\u2019t expected these primitive dracopiens to be pursuing something higher than mere destruction.\nEntering the stronghold, he saw most of the lab instruments had been demolished for weapon parts. Books lay scattered on the floor, most of them rotted by the climate. The few intact volumes were ancient human histories.\n\u201cThey say humans progressed from primitive tribes to tribal coalitions,\u201d Steel Teeth explained. \u201cOn that foundation they established nations. Before we establish our own great tribal alliance, the latter part of human history is useless to us.\u201d\nThese fragmentary histories outlined tribal warfare in remote human ages. Steel Teeth said, \u201cWe have run into a bit of a problem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI threw away all the weapons materiel Foster Father left to me. At the time, I believed they could not compare with sharp teeth. But during our battles with the tribe on the other side of the river, their flame catapults were ferocious. We suffered grievous losses.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you attacked the factory?\u201d A Lei said. \u201cTo find better weapons?\u201d\nSteel Teeth led A Lei outside, to a captured enemy catapult. Made of fern tree, and using oil rendered from dinosaur fat, it was a crude machine. Its only real virtue was the human-made flamethrower lashed to it, which lit the dino-oil payloads. A Lei, staring at Steel Teeth\u2019s deadly incisors, said, \u201cYou should learn to peacefully coexist. You\u2019re all dracopiens. Infighting is pointless.\u201d\n\u201cEnough of that useless rubbish!\u201d Steel Teeth said. \u201cIn ancient times did you humans not make rivers of blood? Without big and powerful tribal alliances, would human civilization have been possible? Did not those powerful human war chiefs, like Odin or Emperor Yan, become deities worshipped by later generations? Does your Starship Alliance not have a battleship named the Emperor Yan?\u201d\nThese dracopiens were naturally despotic. A Lei worried about debating and infuriating Steel Teeth. The prudent choice was to shut up.\nSteel Teeth went vigorously about its leadership duties, handling tribal affairs big and small. It delegated a host of technological problems to A Lei. Luckily, these dracopien tech issues were of the simple Neolithic variety: find abandoned human metal fit for weaponry, develop new techniques for making sharper arrows, learn how to fling fire in this moist environment, and how to process tree fern material into something harder and wood-like.\nWhen he knew he was unobserved, A Lei relaxed and breathed in the mecha. He wanted to contact headquarters, but didn\u2019t know how. Despairing, he glanced down, and saw a hand device on the floor of the cockpit. It must have been dropped by the previous pilot. A Lei smacked himself upside the head in a fierce self-rebuke. If he\u2019d seen the device earlier and called for help, he might have avoided his current predicament.\n6\nHe huddled in the cockpit with the device in his hands. His trembling finger entered the wrong number several times, but he finally connected to the 045 Meat Union factory assistant director\u2019s office. \u201cDirector!\u201d he shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s A Lei! I\u2019m trapped in Rhea!\u201d\n\u201cA Lei?\u201d The assistant director sounded frightened. \u201cYou\u2019re still alive?\u201d\n\u201cIf not, who are you talking to?\u201d\n\u201cWe all assumed you\u2019d been eaten, so we didn\u2019t arrange a rescue team. But on the bright side, financial affairs offered their condolences. They paid for the funeral, and the accidental death insurance has paid out to your parents. Quite a sum!\u201d\nA Lei had to stop himself from smashing the hand device. \u201cSo my family\u2019s quite happy with everything then? You were worried about further losses if you dispatched rescue, is that it? Why eat more financial loss when you can just write me off? Well let me tell you . . . you\u2019ve got bigger problems. These dracopiens aren\u2019t merely lashing out at the factory. They\u2019re conspiring to revolt. They mean to establish a huge tribal coalition. They want to overthrow human civilization and replace it. We need to sound the alarm. Better yet, we need to report this to SA government. We need the Marines if we\u2019re going to suppress these fucking lizards!\u201d\n\u201cSo you want to smash everyone\u2019s rice bowls,\u201d the assistant director said, growing incensed himself. \u201cYou know if Accidents and Safety inspects, all Union factories have to shut down and reorganize. What\u2019s everyone supposed to eat? The Northwest Wind? Now wait . . . if you\u2019re really saying the dracopiens are conspiring to overthrow humanity . . . Just hold on, I\u2019ll report it to the higher-ups and call you right back.\u201d The assistant director disconnected.\nA few minutes later, the device buzzed in A Lei\u2019s hand, and he answered. An old, dignified voice came through, claiming to be the AFF executive director in charge of Rhea.\n\u201cExecutive d-director.\u201d A Lei was low-level, a Union factory worker. He was talking to the man in charge of all food enterprises in Rhea.\n\u201cYoung man,\u201d the old voice said, \u201ctell me frankly . . . what\u2019s happening there?\u201d\nA Lei dared not hold anything back. He recounted the whole disaster, systematically and in full detail.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite a story,\u201d the old man said. \u201cYou\u2019re sure my friend Ai Li-ke was eaten?\u201d\n\u201cY-yes.\u201d\nThe old man sighed. \u201cNo wonder I haven\u2019t heard from him in so long. Ai Li-ke was an outstanding researcher for us. He played an important role in constructing the dinosaur pasturelands. And he was a skilled cook! Specialized in dinosaur eggs. Do you have anything of his? Keepsakes? If so, bring them back to me, and I\u2019ll reward you well.\u201d\nA Lei sifted through the materials he\u2019d collected. \u201cThere\u2019s only fragments of his notebooks left, and a few memory chips. Sir, you must think of a way to rescue me from Rhea. Otherwise I have no way of getting this stuff to you.\u201d He had to prioritize his own little life.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sitting in a mecha now?\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Otherwise I\u2019d have been eaten.\u201d\n\u201cSo it would seem the dracopiens also don\u2019t know what to do with you. You have two options . . . sound the alarm and report to the police, getting a rescue team dispatched. That\u2019s the safest way, but you\u2019d be letting a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity slip through your fingers.\u201d\nThat cut through A Lei\u2019s fear. \u201cAnd the other option?\u201d\n\u201cCut a bloody path out of there, escape on your own, and bring me Steel Teeth\u2019s head. You would have a hero\u2019s welcome, and a promotion. How does deputy captain of a hunting squad sound?\u201d\nA Lei did some quick mental calculations. \u201cI\u2019d be equal to an assistant factory director.\u201d\n\u201cSatisfactory?\u201d\n\u201cYes! Ten thousand times yes! If you\u2019ll keep your promise . . . \u201d He could struggle half a lifetime and never climb that high. He grinned, seeing money, glittering futures, his current danger forgotten.\nAfter the old man had disconnected, A Lei sat there fantasizing. A grim voice like a thunderclap brought him back to the Cretaceous: \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d\nA Lei panicked. He\u2019d forgotten that dinosaur hearing was far keener than his. Steel Teeth had probably heard the entire dialogue.\n7\nAfter that fateful call, A Lei spent every day in fear. Steel Teeth seemed to know its severed head was the price for a deputy captain throne. A group of fearsome dracopiens always watched him, and he was never alone with their chieftain. Sometimes he had to fight the urge to sound the alarm, but the lure of promotion always won out. Steel Teeth had him designing various weapons for the coming tribal wars. A Lei knew nothing of weapon design, but he knew how to research Stone Age weaponry on the hand device. In the course of one hectic month, he designed many weapons for the tribe.\nA Lei understood well enough that if Steel Teeth really wanted him dead, there were many ways. It couldn\u2019t bite through the mecha, but it could starve him. It could slow-cook a stegosaurus leg right in front of him, wait for him to go mad with hunger and leave the cockpit, then casually devour him. But as long as A Lei produced weapon designs, it seemed Steel Teeth would refrain from harming him.\nHe was confined to the castle, but he heard dracopiens speaking of their chieftain\u2019s conquests. Steel Teeth was vanquishing tribe after tribe, consolidating power. He also heard the 045 Meat Union factory was back in business. No one seemed to care about one low-level worker\u2019s whereabouts.\nIt was getting harder to find new data for weapons designs. The decisive moment was fast approaching.\nHe brought up Steel Teeth\u2019s domestication record for the hundredth time, a series of videos shot by Ai Li-ke.\nDracopien reproduction was much like certain turtles\u2019. Parental involvement ended when an egg was laid. Little dracopiens hatched ready to hunt. Like many fish, amphibian, and reptile species in times of scarcity, siblings devoured each other. When Ai Li-ke discovered Steel Teeth\u2019s nest, the little dracopiens were at war. Finally, just one hatchling remained. Ai prepared cow milk and chicken eggs for it, but the fierce little creature only snarled at its new benefactor. Ai Li-ke found this charming, and named it Steel Teeth.\nA montage followed, Ai patiently teaching Steel Teeth to read. Raising this emotionless, reptilian thing was far more difficult than raising a mammal. Mammals come with emotional attachment software preinstalled. Much of the time, Ai had no choice but to administer electric shock to make little Steel Teeth learn obedience. The other method was feeding. Young Steel Teeth learned to curry favor with Ai in order to enjoy the great variety of human food. A sumptuous banquet flowed from Ai\u2019s hand, and Steel Teeth grew very fast, ending up much larger than a wild dracopien.\nNaturally, Steel Teeth\u2019s knowledge far exceeded its wild cousins\u2019. This, combined with its superior size and vigor, allowed it to easily defeat other dracopiens in combat. By the time Ai Li-ke was seventy, Steel Teeth had become the alpha of a large dracopien pack. Tribalism was something new for the species, a new world in which Steel Teeth was the grim hegemon.\nIn Steel Teeth\u2019s eyes, A Lei\u2019s usefulness was drawing to a close. One day it brought some trusted followers into the fortress, where A Lei was hard at work measuring a section of excavated tree fern rhizome, which was meant to become a mortar cannon. A Lei puzzled over two problems: how to produce and use gunpowder in this moist world, and how to make tree fern material strong enough to endure the force of discharge.\nRhea was, in the end, merely the human approximation of a Cretaceous environment. It differed from the real thing. To prevent flowering angiosperms from squeezing out pteridophytes, humans strove to eliminate higher plants from the ecosystem, not to mention maple, birch, and metasequoia. Thus, hard building materials were difficult to come by.\nSteel Teeth brought a taloned foot down, smashing the nascent mortar to pieces. \u201cStop tinkering with such nonsense. This is not Earth. We have bypassed the Iron Age.\u201d\nA Lei went pale. He knew he couldn\u2019t make a mortar. He\u2019d been going through the motions of research, to keep death at bay. Now Steel Teeth had seen through this. He feared the moment of truth had come.\nSteel Teeth\u2019s followers dragged the mecha toward a large gathering of dracopiens. A Lei was deposited on a massive, crude contrivance of tree fern, a kind of war chariot. Looking down upon the wide expanse of dracopiens, A Lei reckoned the alliance was now ten tribes strong. A solemn Steel Teeth reviewed its army. There were many other war chariots, lashed to domesticated stegosaurs and ceratopsians. A vanguard of dracopien-driven T.Rexes, armored in bone and teeth, rushed toward the battlefront.\n\u201cI have unified all the tribes of the Yellow River\u2019s north shore,\u201d Steel Teeth said to A Lei. \u201cToday we unite with the south shore tribes, at long last. Behold, this world\u2019s highest lord.\u201d\nSteel Teeth\u2019s \u201cYellow River\u201d was the great waterway of the region. A hundred kilometers of dracopien deforestation had led to erosion, turning the river into a yellow, turbid flow. \u201cIf the name Yellow River gets around,\u201d A Lei said, \u201cmany Earthlings might have objections. Can you change it?\u201d\nSteel Teeth snorted. \u201cThe chief of the south shore alliance is named Chiyou, God of War.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d A Lei said in amazement.\n\u201cThat is really my nickname for it.\u201d\nThis joke fell flat, but Steel Teeth\u2019s knowledge did more to kill any possible levity. It knew the hazards of a cross-river military campaign. It had chosen to launch its offensive in the enveloping fog of early morning, to obscure numbers and movement. A Lei noticed strange little vehicles among Steel Teeth\u2019s forces, tree fern constructions with crude but clever gears driven by the wheels. No matter which way they turned, their indicator rods always pointed across the river.\nSteel Teeth\u2019s dracopiens were armed with metal weapons burnished by stone and bone. Garlands of some pteridophyte, blooming with primitive flowers, were bound to their heads. The plant was a favorite edible among dinosaurs, resembling Chinese cabbage. To A Lei these advancing dracopiens were comical, a group of hooligans with cabbage hats, but the Steel Teeth tribe knew what it was doing. The headdresses would distinguish friend from foe. If a dracopien emerged from the fog of war without one, it was an enemy, and must be put to the hatchet.\nThe campaign opened with a salvo of burning missiles, dinosaur oil and pteridophyte kindling bundled around large rocks and flung from catapults into the mist. The clamor of impacts and howling enemies traveled across the water. Dracopiens ignited torches bound to the tails of their T.Rex and stegosaur mounts, and drove these beasts charging toward the opposite bank. Many enemies were caught unawares, panicking in the fog, and were hewn down. As others took up arms, Steel Teeth\u2019s main force reached the south shore. With sharp claws and cold steel, they conducted a ruthless slaughter.\n\u201cI am very grateful to you,\u201d Steel Teeth said to a dumbstruck A Lei. \u201cAll your hard work has paid off. Now, I should send you back to your place of origin.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the Starship Alliance?\u201d\nSteel Teeth knocked the mecha prone. Several dracopiens poured dinosaur oil from fern leaf receptacles onto the mecha, and one used a factory flamethrower to ignite it. The mecha burst into flames, and A Lei realized the war chariot was actually a massive catapult. Steel Teeth slashed the restraining rope with a claw swipe, and A Lei, with his several tons of mecha, was airborne and trailing fire. He had become ammunition.\nSteel Teeth watched him fly toward the far shore. \u201cGodspeed,\u201d it said, \u201con the reincarnation road!\u201d\n8\nThis was the largest dinosaur conflict A Lei had ever seen. As he came to, his broken body shot through with pain, cockpit life support showed he\u2019d been unconscious for two days. He had a broken rib, two broken legs, and the ground shook as immense dinosaurs clashed all around him, and on top of him, trampling the mecha as they vied for position. The machine was pounded into the riverbank marsh. Starving and dehydrated, he was forced to drink the foul water and dinosaur blood leaking through a crack in the cockpit. Most of the time he didn\u2019t dare to move, waiting, still and quiet, for the war to end. On the third day of this vigil, there was finally silence above. The dracopiens were no longer fighting at close quarters. He touched a joystick, and the mecha sat up. Dinosaur corpses lay piled all around. He stared in amazement. The Yellow River had been dyed red.\n\u201cLife is strong in you.\u201d\nIt was Steel Teeth, behind him. He turned to find the great warlord lying prone, and gravely wounded, on a burned-to-carbon catapult.\n\u201cI\u2019m not strong. This mecha is. After all, it\u2019s a high-tech SA product. With a hundred-and-fifty-million-year technological lead, how can you lose?\u201d Every word he spoke was a stab from his broken rib. Steel Teeth only heard him thanks to the brainwave converter in the cockpit, synthesizing speech and amplifying it.\n\u201cI have not lost,\u201d Steel Teeth said, \u201cbut neither have I won. This enemy chief was raised by a human, like me. It was big like me, knowledgeable like me. I nicknamed it Chi You in my desire to defeat it. A pity I am not the Yellow Emperor.1 Chi You is dead, but I will soon follow it.\u201d\n\u201cWait, you mean there are others like Ai Li-ke?\u201d\nSteel Teeth moved its massive head with great effort. \u201cThis was humanity\u2019s plan all along. Resurrect us, educate us, lure us toward humanlike development, toward tribes and alliances, toward building the foundation of a society through hand-to-hand combat. No intelligent species can resist trying to make a civilization, even if they know they are a moth darting toward a flame. How can we turn away from war? Every dracopien dreams of becoming an apex foodie. We dream like you dream. We want to make a world according to our desires. We long to satisfy our craving for endless, delicious variety.\u201d\n\u201cWe humans don\u2019t just dream of food. We pursue higher things. Moreover, I plan to become a vegetarian.\u201d Watching tributaries of blood flow into the red river, A Lei thought he would never want meat again.\n\u201cEating is always the first priority!\u201d Steel Teeth growled. \u201cAll life must eat. Hunger is the eternal constant. No food means no life. No life means no dreams, no realization of dreams. Even a superintelligent species is, in the end, biological. Whether you eat animals or plants, you are eating living things. Humanity is just another living thing. Better to admit this. I see through your hypocritical compassion. It is pathetic.\u201d\nA Lei walked the mecha over, meaning to stop Steel Teeth\u2019s bleeding. The beast lashed out, its great mouth ripping the already-cracked canopy to pieces. A Lei, now sitting unprotected in his much-abused machine, stared into a gaping mouthful of teeth, and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to save you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I want that? And how can you save me? It is eat or be eaten, the primal law of the natural world. Plants devour inorganic matter and sunlight. Herbivores eat the plants, and carnivores eat the herbivores. Even high and mighty humans, apex predators that you are, must one day rot and become meal for plants. This is the way of things, the cycle. As intelligent life nurtured by the natural world, your duty is not to destroy this law of nature that brought you about, but rather to protect it. You humans created this world of Rhea. To we dracopiens, you are gods. Gods should preserve natural laws. Gods should maintain nature\u2019s balance, not destroy it.\u201d\nA Lei was confused. \u201cYou revere humanity as gods, yet wish to replace us?\u201d\nSteel Teeth seemed to grin broadly. \u201cWe want to become gods ourselves, revered, with unlimited food! But this is impossible. Rhea is not old Earth. It is not free and unrestrained. There is no coal here, no oil, for industry. Even if humans allowed us to develop freely, we still could not establish a civilization comparable to yours. But we strive, nevertheless. We cannot even reach the Iron Age, but we strive, and lay down our lives without regret.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand. Why is humanity imparting knowledge to dracopiens?\u201d\n\u201cFor more delicious, higher-quality dining, and more developed brains. For your supermarkets and restaurants. For minced meat and Dragon Brain Soup! Foodies as discerning as humans are no longer satisfied with mere free-range meat. You crave carnivores that rush about and fight hand-to-hand. I thought you understood this.\u201d\nA Lei contemplated Steel Teeth for a long time. \u201cYou\u2019re the most wise and farsighted foodie I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\nSteel Teeth laughed, coughed up blood. Lying prone on the burned wreckage of the catapult, it said, \u201cPlease call me Mister Wise and Farsighted Crouching Dragon.\u201d\nSteel Teeth\u2019s laugh was like quaking thunder. \u201cDo not be ashamed of being a foodie. You humans have advanced far enough to break from the natural world, and you thrive. If you followed this timid, benevolent morality you speak of, and ate only foods synthesized in your labs, hundreds of starship biospheres would not exist. The countless animals depending on your pastureland habitats would not exist. We Cretaceous organisms would still be mere fossils. Dracopiens think this way . . . if humans do not eat it, it cannot possibly survive. Dracopiens have never resented your cultivation and hunting of our kind. You humans think so highly of yourselves, but your time will come. Are you not destined to become a feast for microorganisms and plants?\u201d\nA squad of ground effect vehicles appeared in the distance. Steel Teeth gave a mighty roar, and slowly rose. Wounds pouring blood, it faced A Lei in the unprotected cockpit.\n\u201cI have devoured much prey in this lifetime, but I never tormented my victims. My kills were swift, and I am proud of this. Humans brought us into this world, and we delighted in combat, to realize an impossible dream. We are born and have only a few dozen years, but that is enough. And now I tell you one last thing . . . respect your food. I know you mean to take my head and become a captain. We abide by the laws of nature. Let us see who shall eat, and who shall be eaten. Come now. Fight!\u201d\nThis would be a fair duel. A Lei, his canopy gone, was no longer impervious to sword and spear, while Steel Teeth, with its injuries, was neither stronger nor faster than the mecha. Roaring, the dracopien lunged. A Lei touched a joystick. The only thing in the mecha\u2019s arm that might grudgingly be called a weapon\u2014an oversized meat skewer\u2014popped up. Steel Teeth\u2019s deadly bite clamped shut centimeters from A Lei\u2019s face. The skewer stabbed, sinking deep into Steel Teeth\u2019s heart.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d A Lei said, \u201cfor teaching me wisdom, Wise and Farsighted Speaker.\u201d\n\u201cPlease call me Mister Wise and Farsighted Crouching Dragon.\u201d Steel Teeth\u2019s lantern-like eyes slowly closed, the barest trace of regret marring its satisfaction.\n9\nWhen danger and opportunity coexist, courage is the key to deciding one\u2019s fate. If A Lei had chosen to raise the alarm, he would have remained a common worker. He would have spent his life in the stink of the 045 Meat Union factory, perhaps retiring before he could attain the career summit of foreman.\nWhen he brought Steel Teeth\u2019s head back to the company, the hero\u2019s greeting left him dumbfounded. There was adulation and praise for this young person, so composed, so calm as he faced the lights and cameras, calm as a mountain. Only A Lei knew this was a fa\u00e7ade. It was fear that kept him unmoving. After the uprising, the AFF needed a model hero to redeem its image. Despite his lack of qualifications, A Lei was decorated and adorned at the public relations department, and made into an optimal spokesperson.\nAt 22, A Lei became the youngest-ever deputy captain of a hunting squad. This promotion broke several rules, and he knew his qualifications and abilities were being discussed, and found wanting. The higher-ups wanted an experienced hunter. They were waiting for him to wash out. The smallest error could get him demoted, so he was cautious, devoted, and energetic in his work. He couldn\u2019t let this opportunity slip through his fingers.\nHe was very young for such a position. Most of the other deputy captains were of his parents\u2019 generation, and he was higher up than most of his contemporaries. After five years at the job, he got married and enjoyed conjugal bliss. He was promoted, step by step, and ended up the AFF executive director in charge of starship Rhea. By the time his career ended, there were more than a thousand others in the AFF of his rank: pasture habitat executive directors, farming colony planet managers, or exploration team chiefs seeking new foods throughout the cosmos. But A Lei never left Rhea.\nFor most of his life, A Lei sat upright in a tall building, watching his expanse of Cretaceous land, watching dracopiens clash in war after tribal war. Both humans and dracopiens knew what it was all about. Hunting dracopiens was still dangerous work, and although hunting squads were brave, hazarding their lives to kill all types of dinosaurs and deliver them to dining tables, dracopiens were the exception. Better to watch their battlefields, and wait, and harvest warriors on the verge of death. That was how you got the delicacy Dragon Brain Soup.\nMany higher-ups in the hunting squads had dinosaur skulls decorating their offices, and A Lei was no exception. His massive dracopien skull had an engraved plaque beneath it: \u201cMister Wise and Farsighted Steel Teeth, a truth-speaking friend who changed my life.\u201d\nWhenever he encountered problems, and felt irresolute, A Lei would swivel his chair and look up at Steel Teeth\u2019s skull. He tried to imagine how Steel Teeth, the determined warlord, would handle the thorny issue. A Lei\u2019s subordinates feared and respected him. They called him \u201cmaster who thinks deep, like a dinosaur.\u201d\nOne day, A Lei sat in his office contemplating a dracopien egg he\u2019d collected after a tribal war. Thinking of Steel Teeth, he began planning his retirement. He would hatch this egg, build a secluded house here in Rhea, and teach the little dinosaur Steel Teeth\u2019s wisdom. He would raise it to be the next generation\u2019s dracopien leader. After much thought concerning its name, he settled on Steel Teeth the Second.\nPerhaps, someday, Steel Teeth the Second would eat him, as the First had eaten Ai Li-ke. Or perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be interested in human meat, and A Lei would die a natural death in Rhea, in the little house, and become food for bacteria and plants. Neither ending was bad, as far as a pious foodie was concerned.\nFOOTNOTES\n1 - The Yellow Emperor is one of the three legendary Chinese rulers and culture heroes.

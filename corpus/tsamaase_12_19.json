Maybe one day Mama Earth will hear our prayers, maybe one day She will forgive us, and maybe She\u2019ll set Her hound dogs\u2014reality and the new culture\u2014off from our bloodline.\na-burning-soul\nIt starts like always, a burning soul, a still sky, a quiet universe. A white rooster croaks, a death has been foretold. A quinquennial affair. The earth moans under our breath.\nIt is dusk. The sun is menstruating, smearing a rosy tinge across the bleak industrial skyline. It has teeth. Teeth to catch. Teeth of metal and jagged glass. Nothing homelike about this city. The smoggy vapor of every citizen\u2019s breath obscures the soular-powered streetlights. I gaze out our cinderblock apartment windows at the masked commuters below in the streetways unable to tell who\u2019s human, who\u2019s not. Every machine\u2019s gait is seamless, the joints oiled with the occult of the upper-city citizen\u2019s desire and our rigged poverty. In the misty-sandstorm-laden morning, I watch some of the commuter\u2019s smog-voices and smog-words rise into the air, like round shiny balloons, turning the skies rowdy and gray, tearing open the ozone layer. Even the poorest don\u2019t have access to at least one basic human right: a respirator.\nI lean against the window. Huff my breath until the glass fogs, and with my index finger, I draw the words \u201cfreedom is extinct.\u201d My breath is smog. The window clears. I replace my mask, listen to the intermittent buzz-buzz sound of the breath purifier, the air purifier in our household, a secondary precaution in case the former fails. Every apartment window is a widow, staring back with lack of want and light, carved too deep into the fa\u00e7ade to protect tenants from the penetrating hot eye of the sun, its fingers always hot and abrasive. We know it too well, for it probes our thighs, molests the unknown parts of ourselves.\nIt is morning, burning with too much sun. But in the other room, a darkness segues into a deeper dark, the air humid with a breath laden with too much evil that our masks rust by the second. Mama is in death throes with an immense force we can\u2019t see, but we can see the slashes it leaves on her arms, back, and legs. It wants to silence her. But her voice has been to God and back, nothing can stand in its way. Even the shaman takes his shit and leaves, his shame tucked in between his legs.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I yell, grabbing him. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this! You can\u2019t just leave. We paid you. We paid you.\u201d\nHe lifts his palms. \u201cSorry, sisi. You paid me for the work, not its success rate.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of bastard are you?\u201d I shout. \u201cSave her. You can\u2019t just leave her like this.\u201d My glare turns to Mama, her skin wet with sweat, exhaustion an axe in her mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m not God.\u201d The shaman struggles with me by the doorway. \u201cYou can\u2019t force me to be God.\u201d My grip is viselike, so he snarls at me. \u201cAren\u2019t you the hypocrite? How can you force a stranger to be her savior when you couldn\u2019t live up to the task, yet she got you, birthed you for that reason? So you save her. You can\u2019t just leave her like this.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about my birthright.\u201d But my voice is weak, not as poisonous as my anger.\n\u201cFong-kong human,\u201d he spits, and the words wash over me like acid.\n\u201cI swear this is going to come back and haunt you, like all these diseases,\u201d I say, my voice wet with pain. He pauses at this; for, an unfair treatment begets the owner a fatal disease. \u201cIsn\u2019t that how your wife died? She was racist, wasn\u2019t she? She maltreated someone because of their skin-shade. The disease got her. It\u2019ll get you, you fucking swindler.\u201d\nHe falls to his knees, misery torn across his face. \u201cI can\u2019t be God. I can\u2019t save everyone.\u201d\nMy sister\u2019s tiny arms wrap around my waist; her lisp weepy. \u201cTsholofelo, no, please, we\u2019re burning up the minutes we have with Mama. Just let him go. Let him go.\u201d\nMy grip slackens. The shaman shuffles and disappears out the front door.\nMama\u2019s giving birth to death; 13 hours so far of labor. Our uncle, he stands in the bedroom threshold, the daylight from the other room sharp against his back, promising to bring a hopeful help. That bastard man. From the nook, where each of our melanin hangs, my uncle yanks his skin-color coat, throws it over his shoulders, it ties to his bone, taut as ours, black as ours. He wears our skin color, but he\u2019s not like us.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he says gruffly.\nMy sister, Botshelo, nods politely. My head refuses to move, but my palms fold into rage. The coat belonged to my brother who lost the war to this family. My uncle wears it proudly as if he faced the war. Bastard. He has a slew of habits, terrible habits. My uncle, his terrible habits have become the sewage of our city.\nMama screams again. So I have to pin her down from breaking more bones. And I remember how it started. When she returned from work two weeks ago. I\u2019d visit her at work, bringing her lunch I\u2019d cooked. I\u2019d watch her as she sat in her factory chair with knotted fingers, her illness weaving the time-holes, the laptops, the eye-held for the rich, the bones in her back screaming out of her skin. Her skin was too tight to hold anything. I stare out her bedroom window at the shock of sun\u2019s glare, refusing to enter. I stare at the miles of the city, sprawled out. The city rests on tribal land in a metallic voice devoid of adobe sultry notes. Architecture is a refugee of this torn world, unable to run, its feet frozen to the ground. The city has teeth, and it devours the land with its politics and materialistic gluttony. Its devoured its way through nearby villages, upheaving homes for \u201cbetter\u201d franchised architecture. It\u2019s not urban sprawl, its rural devouring; sharp glamorized buildings glooming above shacks and poverty. We, the city, stand in the tribal land of Kang.\nThe country is the city, and it\u2019s devouring its way into my mother\u2019s body.\nMama\u2019s back cranes as she screams. Her teeth gnash, a few topple to the ground. I collect them quickly, shake them like dice for a miracle, and put them in the jar, place it on the shelf next to my great-great-grandmother\u2019s. Mama refuses to die. Not yet. \u201cPlease, Mama,\u201d I cry. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nHer skin sizzles with boils, her scream penetrates everything, like steel boring into my bones. Something beyond us harbors in the air. Botshelo foolishly tries to plead with this thing.\n\u201cPlease, we\u2019ll give you anything,\u201d she cries, spinning around, unseeing. She\u2019s na\u00efve. She doesn\u2019t know that to give is to sacrifice soul-blood. I cup my hand around her mouth.\n\u201cTo live is evil,\u201d something in the air says; maybe the air is not an accomplice, maybe it\u2019s the victim to the voice-holder that hides itself in its folds, camouflaging itself to taunt and haunt us. But that voice came when we hurt the earth; now Mm\u00ea Earth hurts us in turn. In our tribal land, the human soul is tied to the land; what hurts the land hurts the soul. I listen to the burrowing screams, seismic, of mama\u2019s cries as she gives birth to death, fighting it too. Trauma punches a hole into our family\u2019s time\u2014time-hole\u2014because he left, my father.\n\u201cTo save someone, it is better to kill them,\u201d the voice in the air says.\nBut why, why why why?\nThis urban sprawl continues to eat into Mama\u2019s blood, bones, her mind, destroying the culture that once disseminated in her bloodline. The still night is mixed with the sound of rattle-shakers, like cicadas imprisoned in beads, singing into a heated crescendo. The mourning voices of the choirs, a funeral song, as they beat their palms and thrust their illegal unfiltered breaths into the balmy air. The treetops inhale the wind, tossing it back and forth, collecting sin-dust and disposing it into our mask-less faces.\nMama bleeds and screams, breaking bones that recalibrate themselves. \u201cSomeone is killing our land. Someone is our enemy. Someone in our midst hides in our color. Catch them! Catch them; if your land dies, you die.\u201d\nThose were the last words as Mama fought death, a death that tried to silence her, but her voice rose higher than any flesh, a bigger purpose than us. Her voice, her words are immortal, lived longer than the people who thought killing her would stop her entirely. But she lives in those words and many more:\n\u201cOnly non-sinners cast stones,\u201d Mama used to say, \u201cwhich is why I cast my voice to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut how do I cast my voice when it was stolen from me?\u201d I\u2019d ask her.\nMy world ended on my mother\u2019s tongue. She was the only one whose voice wasn\u2019t a murderer. Mama wasn\u2019t a believer, but she survived on her beliefs for a while. \u201cNana, I will only believe what I see,\u201d Mama used to whisper as she kneaded bread, \u201ctherefore all these superstitions are just make-belief hallucinogenic kak that people like to eat.\u201d Kak; crap, shit. We covered her corpse to prepare for her burial, but hours later we found it twisted; the apartment yanked the voice box from her throat, and days on end, the apartment whistled a hazy dark into the folds in between our legs. I hate this apartment. I hate this architecture.\nI don\u2019t know why she had to test reality like that. Now she\u2019s dead. She\u2019s left us alone. And I wonder if she became a believer when she saw what was happening to her. Sometimes faith keeps you alive, but sometimes it kills you. So I hardly hold on to things or people. There are those before us who have sinned more than we have sinned, but they enjoyed the mercy of Mm\u00ea Earth, unlike us today.\nOur sinful habits are the cause of everything that\u2019s happening in our city\u2014every action must birth a more powerful insidious reaction. Our sins are here to reap our sorrows into our corpses.\nMama\u2019s gone and we are without her protection. We are demons; we can\u2019t be exorcised.\nEach week, on a Sunday, we rose early, went to church, sang hymns, waited for the priest to slap our heads desperately trying to extract the demons in our bodies. We\u2019d return in our Sunday church-anointed bodies, and in dark rooms and secret-encased closets, we\u2019d remove our skull-covering, clean the sticky residue of toxic thoughts. Sometimes we\u2019d lick them, gluey and chewy, push them down our throat, wondering how something sweet and delectable was a danger to the environment.\nSun, Hide\nI pray to You, Mother Earth, Mama Earth, Mm\u00ea Earth:\nSun, hide your eye, eclipse your birth from our sins.\nEarth\u2019s hands taste like smoke and suicide.\nWe held our unborn,\nlay open beneath the cirrus veils of sky,\ncatching sunlit stars without knowing the death we salt their throat with\u2014\nour babies, their eager lungs slurping, thinking all is oxygen, all is milk.\nIn the mornings, we pray.\nBecause of infertility from this global war,\nmen have taken children from the streets, to have their children.\nIt\u2019s sick; Sun, hide your eye, eclipse your birth.\nliving-as-an-orphan\nMy bed is a comforting grave at times. The night is still, sleep is a villain, taunting me to lull in its quietude waters. Death is a silent walker. I am drowning in a room full of oxygen. Oh, dear God, no, has the sickness come to get me? Has Mama Earth\u2019s hounds come for me?\nI don\u2019t want to die like my brother, Itumeleng. Mm\u00ea Earth was angry. Her tides were high, her labors strong. She was purging a group of them one by one by their sins. By their lack of consideration for the other. The natives who looted the foreigner\u2019s businesses, burning them down, beating them up\u2014they were found walking about like ghosts, in incomprehensible chatter. My brother, Itumeleng, was one of them. We pulled him home. Several days later, he died. His xenophobic predilection killed him. Sin-fever is fatal.\nBut no, I am not sick. Something else must be the problem. A loud siren flares in the darkness, my bedroom, supported by intermittent flashes of a warning red light. My respirator screeches into the midnight hour, wailing. I sit up, pinwheeling; my lungs burn with pain as I gulp for the excruciating unfiltered air that scrapes its way through my nostrils, frying my alveoli. The respirator continues to cry, clamped to my nose and mouth, a gaudy beast, unlike the sleek expensive models that my friends have. It has a chute leading into my esophagus as thick as a python that swells and assesses the safety of food that enters my body. Tonight, it gags me.\nWarning! Replace your respirator immediately. I need to change it. Warning! Pollutants rife in the air, in the city: carbon emission, racism, oil spills, sexism, deforestation, misogynism, xenophobia, murder . . . I\u2019m not the only one screaming in our neighborhood tonight. Someone is dying because of a simple skull-escaped thought, and as they exhale their smog-breath into the air it contaminates us all. We hurt the earth, and so shall we hurt each other.\nI fall onto the floor, banging my fists, trying to reach for mercy, gulping for air, but choking from its excruciating asphyxiation. I yank open my side table drawers desperately looking for another respirator as I would a sanitary pad when I leaked onto the bed. Dear God, I don\u2019t want to die, not today, please, I\u2019m only eighteen years old. Please, God. I\u2019m hiccupping and sobbing, desperately pleading to God that I hope I didn\u2019t forget to at least leave one spare respirator. Several rustic ones sit aside for return-and-exchange purposes.\nAs I rummage, the glinting eye of a respirator calls my attention as my bedroom\u2019s soul-light licks its reflective surface. I yank the current respirator off my face, and it swivels to the ground, the chute covered in mucus as I choke out stomach-sac produce. Sin-dust quickly steals entry into my nostrils, making me sneeze and cough. I slowly dangle the new respirator\u2019s chute like a spaghetti string into my mouth, and slowly slide it down my esophagus, and to avoid a gag reflex I attempt to do this with ease as I\u2019m dying; it is a skilled art I learned the hard way.\nEventually, the mouthpiece fits snugly into my mouth and nose. A green glow fills my face, the new respirator hums gladly, filtering the air that enters smoothly and cleanly into my body. Fresh air is as rare as a non-manufactured human being. Respirator installed into the body successfully! I made it in 2 minutes 39 seconds, but the poisonous, unfiltered oxygen slimes the surfaces of my lung sacs, deteriorating them further.\nI fold into the floor, tears dampening my face, panic gripping me. The soul-lights in our home flicker. As renewable as they are, the bandwidth of our souls is bone-thin, in need of being replenished. Darkness will fall soon. Life, for the generations before us, used to be easier, air floating around their bodies, easy to inhale, easy to exhale. Mm\u00ea Earth, You used to be so healthy for us . . . until we destroyed You. I understand now why You want to purge us from Your womb. But it is unfair. How come we are the ones to suffer for the before-generation\u2019s desires that smoked our future? I hate them. I hate them all. And now this is who I have become; I sinned by breathing more pollution into Mother Earth\u2019s belly. Nonetheless, I must show gratitude to Mother Earth, God, and the Universe. I prostrate, take a deep breath, glad and desperate for clean air.\nMy respirators last only a month each. This is my last one. I need to buy a new one, tampons, period-pain medication, anti-depressant medication, food, water\u2014these are all necessary things that I can\u2019t do without. Maybe I can do without food for a bit, but with my anemia, I need some iron at least. All my uncle has to worry about is food, Chibuku, and porn. Normally, Mama was the only one who\u2019d remind us to change our respirator the day before they expired, or when we needed to buy more food supplies. These are the holes in our families, the holes we must survive with. Even now, I can\u2019t maintain the tasks she managed. How did she even manage our water harvest, for when we open our taps, the droplets grip to the metal mouth, refusing to release; how did she ration and stretch our food storage for months long?\nWhen Mama died, I had to become a mother to people and grown-ass men I didn\u2019t even give birth to. I only care for my sister. But my bones are tired, they want a rest I\u2019m too afraid to give.\nthe-time-hole\nEvery girl-child is given one of three roles: warriorship, housewifery, birther of death. My sister is neither, so she is considered useless. It\u2019s only been years since my mother died, but it feels just like yesterday. The time-hole initiates the memory every month. We can\u2019t run away from it. My cousin is rattling through the house, carrying away dust and sin, which coagulates to the upper-roof of the soul-blood, slick and sticky. She came when the time-hole reported my mother\u2019s funeral to every family member. Everyone is here. She keeps bustling about every room. I want silence and shadows.\nA low frequency forces itself into our ears, a burning signal, Morse code. The disparate breathing of the earth, its belly. By rote, I rise. Unfold my skin-coat; it ages slowly. I pick my thought-dial, it refuses to connect. Our soul\u2019s bandwidth isn\u2019t strong enough to carry our message, it needs funds, and maybe in many lightyears, someone will hear our story light the sky. Communication and commerce have merged with our bodies, tore its way into our minds with no need of access codes and passwords. It needs our bodies more than we need it. When we were young, Mama used to chide my sister, Botshelo. Botshelo thought of every unforeseeable bad thing. The divorces in our family. Men who weren\u2019t supposed to touch girl-child nieces a certain way. Affairs that clung to the dark in the closets. And every time Botshelo woke up, she wondered if the city had shat her out yet, had purged her yet. She\u2019d see me and hope ceased to light her eyes, so she\u2019d lie back hoping one day that she\u2019d actually die.\nAs I enter my sister\u2019s room, her soul-light flickers as my shadow stomps on it. Her sickness is a gauzy yellow veil in the bedroom. Soon I swallow its acrid taste, bitterer than bile. On the other side of the house, I hear her thought-dial ringing, endless, the hour hanging fruitlessly on the limb of the only technology that connects us. She hardly opens her mouth. But her thoughts always crowd me in the kitchen as I knead bread, hoping to deep-fry magwinya for us. And now, whoever is calling us is impinging on our thought-dial\u2019s bandwidth\u2014we bought two to share five winters ago; we may as well share the same skull. I feel Mama Earth\u2019s force clench around my body, and I do a quick prayer, I will police my own thoughts before they\u2019re skull-born, before You feel their whisper bend Your bones. It\u2019s a hard thing. Our bodies are no longer the refuge of our souls. The flesh soul-holders are grief-stricken.\nBotshelo sits in the dim light, her feet dusty with not-belonging as she ropes sectioned parts of her Afro in wool. For days she looks like this, a medusa with maphondo-styled hair. Her time-hole is rusted and old and hangs next to the rain-wet umbrella by the door. That\u2019s how I remembered that tornado day. The mud footsteps that led to her bedroom. The miasma of her sickness and sweat that hung humid-thick in the air first notified us she was sick, but she wouldn\u2019t tell us why. That\u2019s how I remember my sister. Her time-hole, a metal thing that stored everything about us: biometric data, digital life, AI assistant, bank accounts, medical aid info\u2014everything, yet it wouldn\u2019t tell us what she did.\nI pull aside Botshelo\u2019s tattered curtains, and a bird, something rare in our city, sits on the windowsill pecking at our window.\nBotshelo sits up from her bed, joy brightening her eyes. \u201cDeath\u2019s coming,\u201d she says, staring at the bird. \u201cIt\u2019s knocking on our window. My window.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d I say, sighing. I knock my fist against the window. The bird throws itself into the air, flapping its wings.\nMy sister crosses her arms, a sour twist to her lips. \u201cWhy won\u2019t the doctors just kill me if they won\u2019t save me?\u201d\n\u201cYou know why they can\u2019t kill you,\u201d I say, crying. \u201cThe city still needs your body connected to the grid. How else can they connect to your soul?\u201d\nOur souls light up the riches\u2019 avenues and streets we can\u2019t even call home.\n\u201cNow, here, it\u2019s time to go for your meds,\u201d I say, dragging out her wheelchair from the closet.\nShe pushes herself into her pillows, sulking. \u201cPlease, tomorrow. I hate that place.\u201d She raises her pinkie. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll be more agreeable tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll let us live here,\u201d I say, folding the wheelchair back.\n\u201cBut this was our grandmother\u2019s home. It\u2019s our home,\u201d she cries.\nI walk toward the bed, wrap my arm around her. \u201cThings will work out, let\u2019s just be a bit more patient.\u201d\n\u201cPeople used to live longer than this,\u201d she whispers. \u201cSisi, we expire so fast, but why us? Why not those who had the chance to enjoy Mm\u00ea Earth? Why are we living in their shit?\u201d\nI hold my head in fear of it snapping off my neck. So, like always, my sister counts my fingers hoping that they stay even.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sold my eggs,\u201d she whispers, \u201cto the manufactures. Look at all those abnormal manufactured humans. Yes, they live longer, they\u2019re resilient, but still, we\u2019re still humans, we matter as well. I shouldn\u2019t have signed up for the experiments to save this family\u2014look at me now, they destroyed my body. When it wasn\u2019t satisfactory for them, they fired me, took me off their payroll. They don\u2019t even give a fuck about me.\u201d\n\u201cYou were gone for years,\u201d I whisper, \u201cwhat exactly happened?\u201d\nShe realizes now the acerbic rise of the past, existing in this little room of ours, burning her tongue. Realizes how she never spoke of her experience. Realizes how her discomfort triggers the trauma. I watch her, silently calculating, sifting through her thoughts, editing them then throwing them away because neither one sounds good.\nShe pulls her knees to her chest, peers at me through her thick eyelashes. \u201cWhy am I the one who\u2019s ashamed when it should be them who\u2019s ashamed?\u201d It surprises me, this response of hers, the light sharpening her pupils to a dark pinpoint in her brown eyes.\n\u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cThere are many of them out there.\u201d She rests her chin on her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many. I\u2019m going to die without knowing how many . . . \u201d She hiccups. A sob. A tear streams down her cheek.\n\u201cHow many what?\u201d I ask.\nHer grip tightens around her knees, her shoulders clench forward, as if gripping onto her secret. Maybe she realizes that she doesn\u2019t have long to live, maybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s slowly opening up to me every day.\nI catch her teardrops and massage her shoulder. \u201cHow many what?\u201d I ask softly.\n\u201cChildren.\u201d\n\u201cChildren?\u201d\n\u201cMy . . . \u201d She sighs, digs her head into her knees, then in a muffled voice, whispers. \u201cMy children. The manufactured ones.\u201d\nNo one in our family likes her mouth except me. They\u2019d gagged her with soap once. She woke up to find him with his arm down her throat, soapy and acrid. She couldn\u2019t even scream. His thought-dial, unlike ours, was portable. He was authorized by the family to do that. Their reputation was more important. Perhaps, at a microclimate level that\u2019s how it started\u2014accumulated from every family, from every district, from every nation to the whole continent until it overwhelmed Her, Mm\u00ea Earth. So when my sister tells me she has children, I think it\u2019s just her typical mouth speaking silly stuff.\n\u201cThe plan behind the experiments was to migrate the upper-class citizens into a more resilient body that can withstand our climate,\u201d she whispers. \u201cThey\u2019ve already paid body rentals and purchases of the manufactured bodies.\u201d\nMy respirator makes a hoarse noise, then I realize it\u2019s me gasping, choking. I clasp my hand to the respirator, as if it\u2019s in the way of my breathing. It\u2019s the shock, filling my bloodstream with adrenaline. Is this what Mama meant? Someone is killing our land. Someone is our enemy. Someone in our midst hides in our color. Catch them! Catch them; if your land dies, you die.\nOur land is our bodies.\nI\u2019m supposed to love my sister, to care for her, but each time I look at her, I feel this grudge, its furnace burning in my body. I stare at her as if she\u2019s holding a knife to my back. I could be next. I could be Mama. I grip her shoulders, my sudden movement stunning her. \u201cWhy is She doing this to you?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat did you do to Her?\u201d\n\u201cTo who?\u201d she shrieks.\n\u201cMama Earth!\u201d I yell. \u201cWhat did you do to turn Her against our family. Are you telling the truth? I ask. \u201cIs this why you\u2019re re-sick? You only become sick when you\u2019ve sinned against Mama Earth.\u201d\n\u201cI became part of their experiments, part of their sins, and yes, I may have sinned.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you to Her?\u201d\nShe clasps her ears with hands.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t be ashamed,\u201d I say. \u201cJust tell me.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone sins against each other thinking they\u2019re going to live forever, thinking they can trick Her. You can\u2019t. Sin leads to death.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one sick in our family,\u201d I say.\n\u201cEven malome is sick,\u201d she yells. Malome; uncle. \u201cHe thinks I don\u2019t hear him at night, creeping through our passage into the toilet, vomiting every night, his diarrhea filling the toilet bowl, him wearing heavy garments in this heat wave. He\u2019s trying to hide the rash from the sin-fever.\u201d Her eyes turn deadly on me. \u201cSoon you\u2019ll fall sick.\u201d\nThere are secrets in our family. Terrible secrets that lie on our skin like rash. The rage in me burns. I stare at the blatant, gaudy sickness clinging like a batshit lover to her skin. The rash. The boils. The scathing lies. What did you do to become like this? Are you still my sister? Why do you cling to your secret like this disease clings to your bones? What pollution did you impose into the environment that it turned on you? Did you burn down someone\u2019s house? Did you talk down to someone because of their religion? Did you kill someone? Mother Earth no longer stands for such pollutants anymore. I ask these questions only to myself because she won\u2019t say. Who are you? I hate that there\u2019s a part of her that I don\u2019t know. Mama Earth knows all our secrets, Her and God and the Universe, and They will not let us live freely with them.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you learned anything from Itumeleng?\u201d I ask her, reminding her of the family fable, the death of our brother.\nA family fable:\nThe only reason someone becomes sick is because they sinned, did something terrible. Last summer when the sun was boiling the air, my brother was one of many behind the xenophobic attacks on foreigners\u2019 businesses\u2014looting, burning, killing. The next morning as I made breakfast for the family, he sat in the middle seat as usual. He tried to eat the bread. He tried to drink the coffee. But his mouth was skew, and everything slipped out. The next morning, his mouth was slack, teeth unhinged. He had a knife. Scratched at his skin.\nHe was allergic to his skin.\nHe scraped it down to white flesh that was just as quickly flooded with bright-red blood. He became allergic to himself. The only cure was death. Mama Earth was trying to purge him as he tried to purge the outsiders; but not as quickly as he snuffed them. She did it slowly and painstakingly so that perhaps remorse diluted his rage. Only good and God and Allah or whoever holy you believe in will exist. All evil will be extracted out like a bad molar from Mama Earth\u2019s mouth. The rest, She will purge unto death. The racism and exclusion too, hit back like a bad wave of locusts, harbingers, a pandemic of encephalitis. The population was low. They tried to manufacture new people who\u2019d be more resilient to this new climate.\nTomorrow is looking for Future\nWe still continue to sin. I have been out, looking for a second piece-job; it\u2019s been a failure. I am brilliant, I am smart, I am talented\u2014I know that, but I lack the privilege and wealth to get into \u201csomewhere, somewhere.\u201d Every department\u2019s response: \u201cWe are looking for someone with mass appeal,\u201d they say, every snow-white strand pulled tautly from their scalps. \u201cYour work, your body is not a fit for our list . . . unless you are interested in signing up for our experiments.\u201d\nI was desperate, but not that desperate. Look at what they did to my sister\u2019s body, and I still have to take her to them for meds. But I didn\u2019t want to be blacklisted for my attitude, so I bowed my head, smiled, and thanked them for their consideration. When I stepped outside, I couldn\u2019t breathe. I was filled with a burning panic at the truth: there are walls built around me. I can\u2019t see them, but I can feel how they suck at the air around me leaving me unable to breathe. All the things they want me to censor about myself will eventually censor my existence in their eyes; from this, as Mother Earth has dictated, they will die. But they don\u2019t believe in this \u201csuperstition\u201d like Mama didn\u2019t. And now she sleeps in a grave.\nOn the way home, I tried contacting my sister, but she was not responding to my thought-dial, so I had to storm up the dirt-stirred concrete stairs. She\u2019s probably with her boyfriend. Lung-borne pollutants proliferate the air, obscuring the hallway\u2019s path. I bang on an apartment door\u2014her boyfriend\u2019s. I bang it again. He, the boyfriend, yanks it open. Climate change has made a home in the marrow of their bones. His studio apartment contains doctored air hyped with amphetamines, secondary meth-smoke.\nThe lady downstairs selling gene-hacked vegetables told me that she heard from a neighbor that my sister and her boyfriend stoned a young couple a few days ago.\nI refused to believe her. \u201cThey\u2019re not violent people,\u201d I tried to tell her. \u201cNo, not my sister.\u201d\n\u201cThey called the couple terrible words, said they\u2019re sick, yet your sister and her boyfriend are the sick ones. What fucker does that to another human being? Bashes their head in because of their love?\u201d she\u2019d asked. \u201cThey\u2019re sick, I tell you. Demented.\u201d\nThen the old woman hobbled to her workstation to pick up her thought-dial and sent me the image that was circulating through many thought-dials. The couple, two young girls in love, lying huddled in the street. My sister and her boyfriend, their hands bloody, their eyes rabid and fierce.\nI staggered backward. \u201cThis is not my sister, no, she\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s not capable of this.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so foolish with your faith in your sister,\u201d she\u2019d said.\nI want to rid our city of this pollutant that continues to destroy our world. This pollutant that infests my sister\u2019s body. If my sister dies from sin-fever\u2014no, I can\u2019t watch her die so that the world continues to live. She is my world more than this Earth is. It\u2019s not her fault\u2014but this is her, hurting another human being, for what reason?\n\u201cMy sister, she\u2019s only fourteen,\u201d I whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s just a kid. He\u2019s twenty-three.\u201d\n\u201cDating a kid. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s doubly sick.\u201d The old woman grabbed her thought-dial back. \u201cThe police don\u2019t need to lift a finger,\u201d she said, \u201cMama Earth will sort these criminals out. They deserve what\u2019s coming to them.\u201d\nActions and thoughts lead to real sickness. Stoning someone can give you a disease worse than cancer. And I see it now, what Mama Earth is doing to them, the encephalitis sickness of their consequences, gripping to their sharp cheekbones, as they limp around the small apartment, looking puny and pitiful. A cackle of thunder as if Mama Earth laughs over this. My sister\u2019s boyfriend is shaky, at first, bones brittle, cytosine rife with anxiety and depression like every other citizen, and saturated with commercial ads that probably sprayed every tester at them from every fa\u00e7ade with cleaning agents to protect society from their sickness, charging them an automatic \u201csmall\u201d fee that they couldn\u2019t pay.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. They both stare at me stupidly.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was puking,\u201d Botshelo says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my thought-dial. Just saw your message. I\u2019m ready, we can go.\u201d\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d I ask. \u201cDid you hurt those women?\u201d\nHer lips tighten into themselves. \u201cDon\u2019t believe every rumor you hear.\u201d\nI raise my rusty thought-dial. \u201cI have evidence of you and him\u2014\u201d I point at her boyfriend without staring at him\u2014\u201churting them.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a misunderstanding.\u201d She picks up her luggage and drags her body to a stand. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\nI stand in her way. \u201cWhy did you hurt those women? They\u2019re barely holding on to life at the hospital.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of the hospital, if we don\u2019t leave now, we\u2019ll be very late.\u201d\nI shake my head. \u201cTake your damn self.\u201d\nAs I turn my back on her, her voice reaches out to my neck. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so innocent. Don\u2019t neglect your family or Mama Earth will punish you like She\u2019s punishing our uncle. You\u2019ll be next soon.\u201d\nI turn to her. This is my sister. When did she change? Become this way? Is it the sickness now changing all that remains of her? In the days to come what will she turn into before she dies? Does she still love me? No, not if she will stoop so low to threaten me so as to do what she needs.\nChemical weapons fondled Earth too much. I guess the environment became sick and fed into her, then she became sick and fed into the environment\u2014this cycle, no quarantine. I remember we\u2019d drive for miles, the fields barren, the quarry a white-torn wound in the earth. The earth tried to swallow back its ocean, but it came back in tsunamis, washed aside our homes in toxic acid. My eye-feed blurs, another village has gone down. Everyone is living in temporary housing, but the rich stay in the sky, smoking it up, because they can afford it.\nI slam the door leaving them alone, wiping tears from my face with my fist. My family is falling apart, Mama Earth. I\u2019m sorry, please forgive them, I yell at the sky.\nI step outside, the heat boiling the air. Fuck.\nWe have become foreigners to Earth, and it has turned xenophobic.\nhidden-by-night\nDarkness falls. The moon clicks into place, like a bullet into the chamber. I must hide. I catch sight of the moon, half-slain, a stranger. Why is Mama Earth punishing my uncle? What has he done?\nNightly. Moonlight sways through the air abnormally, and once in contact with skin, a rash quickly develops. Severe asphyxiation initiates. Soon death befalls the body. The moon is a toxic beauty. We must remain indoors; the tectonics of architecture are built to restrain outside toxins from us, and our toxins from the natural environment. It\u2019ll be only an hour before the city shuts the moonlight out.\nNight; the world dissolves into black. All I hear is humming rain, panting breaths. Every noise slows down to a heartbeat. Soul-lights flare. Only the broken moon\u2019s shadow tells us the time. I can leave my residence now. I will follow him, the honorable uncle, to see what he does under the cloak of night.\nMaybe once I witness his ugly actions, then I will understand the sickness that pervades my sister, that is killing my family one by one. As I follow him in the dark\u2014through the backstreets, the gravel road, the barren fields, to a lowly place between two hills, a tavern overlooking a bonfire\u2014my thoughts burn a feverish gloom, evaporating from my skull, almost exposing my hiding place. It\u2019s not just us, there\u2019s a tavern of them. Oh, dear, God, Mama Earth\u2014it disgusts me what they do. I crouch lower behind a cactus. Moon, hide your eye, eclipse your birth from our sins. A tavern of them stand, dancing and drinking around the bonfire. Laughing. Little children. There are little kids here. How can these people laugh at this evil they create?\nWho can I cry to in this very second that can stop this cruelty? Even if I ran back to the city to report them, they\u2019ll be gone by the time I get back. My thought-dial has no network. Mama Earth, there are people made of devil-skins unburned by God hands. These are the people I see in our newsfeed in our government in our schools who act as our guardians\u2014these are the people that make a noose out of bible pages, wrap it around our ears and eyes, and hang You dry. They wrap it around the night, saying, \u201cThis is the lung of Earth.\u201d I know these men with starving throats so full of fire to evade the teeth of ethics; they\u2019re carving hunger into the belly of our children, saying our food security is compromised, saying there is drought, yet they\u2019re taking these children\u2019s hunger to dress their dinner tables. They light the torch of hunger in our bellies and parade streets and slums saying, \u201cHere is light, here is star.\u201d\nI press my fist against my mouth to stop me from screaming at the horror. Behind closed skins, and even in the sockets of eyes, they bury themselves in wombs of little children to carve their names inside them, until their bellies balloon to sky, their hearts nowhere found. Is this what happened to my sister in her experiments? I can\u2019t watch this anymore. Sun, moon-stain your bloodied ribs. We\u2019re a spatter of sky, there are sinless stars broken from the voice in our throats. These men, there are deserts in their heartlands. They\u2019ve learned how to open children-thighs, their mouths are spraying evil into the crooks of their knees, breaking the language from them in villages where the tongue is tender, the brain soft.\nThe village, a mecca for men\nwho still fondle the night with their wife hung around their necks.\nThey make a shebeen of children\u2019s limbs,\nturning their hearts into sorghum and dust,\nteeth nicking their magic from children\u2019s milk,\nchildren who don\u2019t know what it means to be the hourglass of birth\nas death lilts at the cages in their chests.\nIt snows in parts of them that didn\u2019t know the sun.\n\u201cChild, do you understand my anger now?\u201d the voice in the fold of the air enters my ears, quietly. I jump, turning around. There\u2019s no one near me. No one has seen me.\nMama Earth is intimate with my thoughts: Mama Earth is that you? Has it been you all along?\n\u201cChild, do you understand my anger now?\u201d She asks.\nAll along it\u2019s been Your voice in the air, Mama Earth?\n\u201cChild, do you understand my anger now?\u201d the air-voice repeats into my ear.\nI understand Your fury, Mama Earth.\n\u201cWhat must I do now?\u201d You ask. \u201cMust I let such people live?\u201d\nStop them, stop them, the kids\u2014the poor kids!\n\u201cTo live is evil,\u201d Mama Earth\u2019s air-voice says. \u201cDo you see that now? Now tell me, what must I do?\u201d\nStop them please.\n\u201cHow must I stop them?\u201d She asks. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember this? Remember we have been here before?\u201d\nThere are so many memories in my head. We became man, the machine that decimated the planet, hastened its way toward its end. The phantom of our thoughts rose from our limbic systems as we slept and night\u2019s tentacles fed into our nervous system. Anxiety and depression grew like the urban sprawl of our cities into the marrow of our bones.\n\u201cWhat else do you remember?\u201d Mama Earth asks.\nOur home villages were gone, replaced by cold foreign skyscrapers, its mother tongue guillotined. With toxic lungs, our thoughts carried weapons through the night, tore the trees down, sullied the waters. I remember seeing an angry moon that night, leaking death into our time-holes. Time-holes, the only thing close we had to sanity, to humanity. That night, we silenced our thought-dials, watched our time-holes glow in the dark. My sister was bone-tired. \u201cClimate change has crept from the built environment into the marrow of my bones,\u201d she\u2019d whispered in that raspy voice of hers. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with me. Climate change lives in me. The old are lucky to have died and lived in a safer Earth. This one wants to purge me\u2014Earth doesn\u2019t want me born.\u201d\nI remember she\u2019d stared at her time-hole hoping for a better reincarnation, but time was a ceaseless, indifferent creature. Her time-hole sat on the mantelpiece, anachronistic, beeping at the endless updates it starved for. During the night, we listened to the hoarse grumble of taps that were thirsty for water. She checked her time-hole where every part of her life resided. There were no funds. There were no jobs. There were no opportunities, except the hole in between her thighs to hold men who didn\u2019t want children.\n\u201cYou can start afresh,\u201d Mama Earth\u2019s air-voice says. \u201cBut to live again you have to die. It\u2019s the only way I can stop or save them. Tell me, how must I stop them?\u201d Her air-voice fills me. And I know what she wants me to say. \u201cWhy do you keep choosing to relive your family\u2019s past and trauma. Let\u2019s stop it now. Do not be afraid, child.\u201d\nI stand on the edge of a rock, whisper to the wind, \u201cI know what I\u2019m going to do will be considered evil, illegal. I do not care.\u201d Summertime languishes on winter\u2019s skin. Sky tears are saltier than ever. Forests and grasslands are scraped back like alopecia of the land. We\u2019re buried in this tombstone of tar; a desert gives birth to anorexic trees.\nHow can they not feel that? How can they not taste that? Our evilutions are running through Mother\u2019s bloodstreams.\nSun, Earth: your truth needs pain.\nI\u2019m sick of it.\nI.\nAm.\nSick.\nI do not care;\nso Sun, hide your eye, eclipse your birth.\nTonight, the city goes.\nSea-rise will be our baptism, brushing Her breath of our toxin.\nThat\u2019s when the fissure tore through Your layers, it\u2019s Your anger Mama Earth, and rocks from the hill eclipsed some lives. That\u2019s why You drowned some continents, Your bile swallowing whole civilizations. Many times this has occurred based on such morbid actions. You\u2019re sick of it. So sick it hurts. You, Mother Earth, taste like suicide, smoke, smog.\na-sleeping-earth\nI don\u2019t know where I am currently. I am a being freed of flesh. I am sight without bone, without structure. Hope is a sun that never rises. A moon that never \u201cwoke.\u201d All it knows is a night full of stars it pulls from people\u2019s hearts.\nThere\u2019s no existence in the constellation. There is only smoke and no God in the horizon. Look at Her, Mother Earth, Her womb protruding into a constellation of space and dark matter\u2014we matter. The heat warms Her globe, She is lit, She is lava. Atmosphere is our gas mask, forests are an underbrush of sky, and ocean waves emulate amniotic fluid. Gravitational pulls, the labor pains. The ozone layer unfolds, the gases choke. The sky is screaming. The sun broke, and he\u2019s bleeding past our horizon.\nI am gone, I am going, but I am here too.\nEverything hurts. Everything\u2014it hurts. The Earth, She hurts\u2014we degrade Her skin, discriminating it with war, bombs, shootings, and pollution . . . there are parts of Her body desecrated, forcing people to flee, leaving Her naked. Don\u2019t you see? She\u2019s human too. We live in Her\u2014Her womb. Earth can\u2019t commit suicide; we commit it for Her. I am gone, I am going, but I am here too. Everything hurts. Everything\u2014it hurts. Don\u2019t you see? But the pain. Tell me you can\u2019t smell that? The summer sky smells smoke. I smell smoke. Her soul, a pyre for our desire, burns. The summer sky . . . my starry eyes are smoked. This is what we became; Her ozone layer is torn, the sun leaks through. She is bleeding moon. Everything hurts . . . the oceans, the ecosystem\u2014Her heart, it beats outside Her.\nOur heartbeats were cataclysmic, a big bang, giving birth to pandora-things. Every creation gives birth to chaos as well\u2014we know this now and we will be reborn.\nAnd that Woman, soft rivers run in her throat, volcanoes thunder in her voice\nShe is lady,\nShe is monster,\nShe is Sun,\nHide your eye,\nEclipse your birth,\nSea-rise will be our baptism\nWe will be reborn.\nTlotlo Tsamaase is a Motswana writer of fiction, poetry, and architectural articles.

She\u2019d said she was a law student, and he could already imagine her in a courtroom, calmly trapping duplicitous witnesses in the web of their own lies. Her two current housemates, both philosophy majors, were sitting on the couch beside her, but whatever they were doing on their own phones seemed entirely unrelated to the interview.\n\u201cAny allergies?\u201d Justine continued.\n\u201cUmm, only pollen. As far as I know.\u201d\n\u201cI meant allergies to pets,\u201d Justine explained. \u201cWe have a cat, Pawpaw. Though if you have any serious food allergies, that would be good to know, too.\u201d\nJames said, \u201cWe had a cat when I was a kid. I\u2019m definitely not allergic to cats. Or peanuts.\u201d\n\u201cCan you pay two weeks\u2019 rent in advance, plus one more for the security deposit?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nAt the mention of rent, Ferouz and Lisa looked up. They exchanged glances with Justine; none of them seemed to need spoken language to confer.\nJustine said, \u201cWelcome to number 37.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d James transferred the money, and when the real estate agent\u2019s computer responded with a receipt acknowledging that his name had been added to the lease, he felt the tension in his shoulders ebbing away. He\u2019d only had three more days left to find a new place.\nAs the interview panel rose to their feet, a small black-and-white cat padded into the room, tail high, mewing. Lisa crouched down and stroked its head, and it immediately began purring loudly and pressing back against her fingers.\n\u201cWow, he\u2019s affectionate,\u201d James observed. \u201cOr she?\u201d\n\u201cHe, but he\u2019s neutered,\u201d Ferouz replied.\n\u201cYou should introduce yourself,\u201d Lisa suggested. When she stepped away, the cat turned around and stared up at her pleadingly, so James quickly squatted down and took her place. Pawpaw responded as enthusiastically as he had to the more familiar human, rubbing his skull against James\u2019 knuckles as if nothing could be more satisfying.\nJames couldn\u2019t help smiling, but then he realized that the odd changes in texture he\u2019d noticed were not tangled bits of fur, but small lumps beneath the skin. \u201cHas he got ticks or something? On his head?\u201d Maybe all this rubbing was about trying to dislodge the parasites or at least deal with the itch.\nLisa laughed. \u201cNo, that\u2019s the interface.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\nShe gestured with her hands spread above her skull. \u201cThe Bluetooth antennas for the electrodes.\u201d\n\u201cYou put electrodes in your cat\u2019s brain?\u201d\n\u201cNoemi had them installed,\u201d Ferouz interjected. \u201cPawpaw was hers. But then she had to leave the country, and she couldn\u2019t take him with her.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d James didn\u2019t want to assume it would be safe to bad-mouth the housemate he was replacing; they might have all adored her and entirely approved of her decision.\n\u201cShe only did it so he wouldn\u2019t attack the native wildlife,\u201d Lisa said, taking over stroking duty. \u201cIt would be cruel to keep him locked up inside; the software stops him catching birds when he goes out.\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t a bell on his collar do the same?\u201d\n\u201cThe studies show that this is four times more effective. And it doesn\u2019t bother him at all. I mean, does he look miserable to you?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d James admitted. The cat was purring madly. But was that a genuine response to the company of the housemates, or just the software in his collar dictating how he felt?\nThe whole thing made him queasy, but what was he supposed to do? Make plans to spirit Pawpaw away to a deprogramming facility? Give up his place here and spend the next month trying to claw his money back, so he could feel virtuous while changing nothing?\nThere were a million worse things happening every day, and the cat wasn\u2019t suffering in any ordinary sense of the word. Lecturing these people about a situation they hadn\u2019t even chosen themselves would just make him seem obnoxious and set him up for a miserable tenancy until they managed to eject him.\n\u201cCan I move in today?\u201d he asked.\n2\n\u201cRemember the product rule?\u201d James prompted Leon. \u201cThe swimming pool, with both sides getting larger?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leon replied stubbornly. \u201cYou never told me anything about a swimming pool.\u201d\nJames knew better than to contradict him. \u201cIf you increase the lengths of both sides of a swimming pool, the biggest change in the area will come along the sides: the length of one side times the change in the other, plus the length of the second side times the change in the first.\u201d He sketched the rectangles, for the ninth or tenth time.\n\u201cYeah, but the water will just get lower,\u201d Leon pointed out. \u201cWhich is where your whole argument falls down. You\u2019re ignoring the conservation of water.\u201d He tipped his chair back and regarded James with triumphant contempt.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the slope of x times cos x?\u201d James pressed him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think you need the product rule, find it another way, but there has to be an answer.\u201d\nLeon disagreed. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick question. You can\u2019t just multiply anything you want. x is an angle, but cos x is something else. It\u2019s like multiplying apples and oranges.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean like . . . newtons and meters? Or persons and hours?\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Leon agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a word salad.\u201d\nWhen his person-hour was up, Mrs. Cooper walked James out onto the verandah and addressed him quietly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Leon\u2019s failed four tests in a row now. It\u2019s just not working out for us.\u201d\nJames said, \u201cOkay. I understand.\u201d There was no point telling her that her son was a lazy, entitled prick, and that no tutor in the world would ever summon better results from him. \u201cCan I still list you as a reference?\u201d\nShe grimaced. \u201cIf anyone asks about you, I can only be honest, and I\u2019m not sure that would do you much good.\u201d\n\u201cAll right. But if we\u2019re being honest, Leon isn\u2019t trying at all.\u201d\nMrs. Cooper laughed. \u201cYour job was to make him passionate about the subject! His teachers couldn\u2019t do it, which was why I was paying you.\u201d She shook her head, bemused, and walked back into the house.\n\u201cMaybe next time hire a supermodel,\u201d James muttered. \u201cA cocaine-dealing supermodel, who\u2019ll tell him how calculus will make him rich.\u201d The cicadas ignored him.\nIt was a stinking hot night, and as he sat at the bus stop, he could smell his own sweat fermenting, drowning out the floral notes from the suburb\u2019s manicured gardens. He wished he could go home and grab a shower before his shift but because the bus timetable had changed, it was impossible. At the restaurant, in the staff toilet, he splashed water on his face and torso, then he put on his uniform and walked out into the furnace of the kitchen.\n\u201cAny chance of more hours?\u201d he asked Ken, when he came around checking on the burger line.\nKen snorted. \u201cI offered you more hours a month ago, and you said it would make you too tired for your lectures.\u201d\n\u201cBut if I could start earlier . . . \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need people earlier.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d James decided. \u201cAny time, then.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got everyone we need, right now. But I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nOn the bus home, James skimmed through the employment listings. Before Leon, his students Chris and Andrea had both been a joy to teach, curious and eager, just needing someone with the patience to reframe what they couldn\u2019t always grasp the first time. But there were no tutoring jobs on offer close enough that he could make them fit in with his schedule.\nIt was after midnight when he entered the house; with everyone else asleep, he felt more like a burglar than a fellow resident. As he poured himself a glass of water, Pawpaw appeared and began performing tight figure eights around his feet. He opened the back door then waited for the cat to bury his feces and return.\n\u201cGo back in with Lisa,\u201d James whispered, with a shooing gesture. She always left her door slightly open, and he gathered Papaw usually slept on her bed since Noemi had departed. But his own verticality seemed to render him more interesting; it was all he could do to slip into his room and close the door.\nAs he lay in the dark, sleep seemed impossible; he kept rerunning the calculations for the time that remained until the water flowing into his own financial swimming pool was overtaken by the quantity pouring out. But then he noticed the pool expanding, each side growing without the level dropping, the volume of water magically increasing to fill the extra room.\n3\nJames woke to the sound of someone playing Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d on a tinny electric keyboard. \u201cMake it stop!\u201d he bellowed; newcomer or not, there were some things he shouldn\u2019t have to put up with. When the dirge continued, he leaped out of bed and stomped into the kitchen.\nThe keyboard sat on the table, but the player seemed to have fled. All he could see was Pawpaw standing over it, treading on keys at random.\nExcept the keys the cat was pressing weren\u2019t random. The rhythm was halting, as it had been from the start, but as far as James could tell the melody was note-perfect.\nLisa, crouched in a corner with her phone held up to record everything, burst out laughing. Pawpaw stopped playing and began mewing plaintively, apparently confused by the mixed messages from his audience.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a post!\u201d Lisa announced.\n\u201cWhatever fresh hell this is, leave me out of it,\u201d James snarled.\n\u201cOh, come on, the expression on your face was priceless!\u201d\nFerouz entered the kitchen, smiling. \u201cWe were trying out the new collar app last night, saying, wait until James sees this . . . \u201d\nJames realized he\u2019d slept through his alarm or shut it off on autopilot; he had a lecture in forty minutes. He took a shower and grabbed a muesli bar to eat at the bus stop.\nLisa emailed him a link to her video. On the bus, James tried to get it taken down, on the basis that he hadn\u2019t consented to being recorded, but after the YouTube Complaints app had confirmed that his current face was indeed a \u201cprobable match\u201d to his face fifteen minutes before, it also determined that he was an \u201cincidental bystander\u201d in the contested material, and ruled that imposing his wishes would be \u201cunduly onerous on the content creator, and/or disproportionately chilling for free speech.\u201d\n\u201cYou may still tag your likeness here with nonbinding reuse advice,\u201d the app added helpfully. \u201cJust check one or more of the following. This image is inappropriate for general media release if I am (a) arrested, (b) deceased, (c) a victim of crime.\u201d\nWhen he arrived at the campus, he sprinted to the lecture theater and managed to reach a seat in the back before the demerit siren sounded. The Machine Learning classes had been packed for the first four or five weeks, full of people who fondly imagined that the course would enable them to found their own billion-dollar start-ups, but as the truth sank in, the numbers had thinned. Some of the methods they were studying could be extremely useful for certain kinds of problems, but there were no magic bullets, and the most noisily hyped commercial applications were pure snake oil.\nAfter the lecture, as he joined the students filing out, someone touched his shoulder. He turned and saw Sarah frowning at him. \u201cYou look terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you find a new place or are you sleeping on someone\u2019s couch?\u201d\n\u201cI found a place,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not perfect, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nHe described the morning\u2019s musical interlude, but that wasn\u2019t actually the reason he was tired. \u201cI lost a tutoring job last night,\u201d he added. All his troubles sounded petty when he spelled them out this way, but the line from David Copperfield was hard to argue with. How many shillings was he away from misery?\n\u201cAre you still working at the casino?\u201d he asked, as they emerged into the glare of the courtyard.\n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll let you know if there are any openings.\u201d\n\u201cThanks. Though I\u2019d rather just take them for a few grand, if you can swing it. What\u2019s the point of a computer science degree if I can\u2019t even empty out a poker machine?\u201d\nSarah nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do. But maybe you should practice first by hacking the cat.\u201d\n\u201cThe cat\u2019s been through enough.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she agreed. \u201cHack it so those clowns can\u2019t keep messing with it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to start a feud with people I have to live with.\u201d\n\u201cCover your tracks!\u201d she urged him. \u201cYou think they\u2019re going to hire a digital forensics team to find out why their kitty\u2019s stopped doing party tricks?\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it past them. Lisa has sixty thousand followers on YouTube.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to pay for anything,\u201d Sarah scoffed.\n\u201cI know, but I think she has rich parents, and she really likes the likes.\u201d\nThey were approaching the library. \u201cIs everything okay with you?\u201d James asked. In between their banter he was sure he\u2019d sensed something nagging at her.\n\u201cI broke up with Andrew last week,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. How long were you together?\u201d\n\u201cSeven months. But I met someone on the weekend, so there\u2019s that.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. That\u2019s . . . efficient.\u201d\nSarah smiled and replied in a Tennessee Williams drawl, \u201cI have always depended on the strangeness of Tinder.\u201d\nJames glanced toward the entrance to the library. \u201cI have an assignment due.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d\n4\nJames was in the kitchen, cooking pasta, when a small blue-and-white marble rolled between his feet and rebounded off the cupboard beneath the sink.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a goal!\u201d Ferouz proclaimed from the doorway. Pawpaw stood in front of him, wearing tiny roller skates and holding a miniature hockey stick in his mouth. Lisa was off to one side, recording, as always.\nJames said nothing, but Lisa caught the look on his face and launched into a defense. \u201cHe loves doing these videos! It\u2019s an enriching experience for him!\u201d\n\u201cYou ever thought of getting him a toy mouse?\u201d James suggested. \u201cOne of those motorized ones he could chase around the house?\u201d\n\u201cEew, that would be creepy,\u201d Lisa declared.\nPawpaw began to slip on the linoleum; he looked alarmed for a moment but managed to flop down on his side. Ferouz approached and took the skates off. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who pay for his food and vet bills,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cJustine doesn\u2019t help. We could have just sent him to a shelter when Noemi moved out.\u201d\n\u201cSo what if I pay my share?\u201d James asked rashly. \u201cWould I get a say in how he\u2019s treated?\u201d\nLisa did not look happy, but Ferouz replied, \u201cYou\u2019d get an equal vote.\u201d\nJames pondered the proposition. If he wanted to have the collar turned off, Ferouz and Lisa would vote him down, but maybe he could chip away at their bloc by starting with smaller issues.\n\u201cIf I agree to pay a third of his upkeep, and I buy a toy mouse, will you vote to let him play with it?\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be so bad going for broke if he was guaranteed at least one success.\nFerouz did not seem discomfited at all. Maybe he was looking for a chance to save money, while still holding on to the balance of power\u2014and needling Lisa would just be a bonus. \u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d he replied.\nJames ordered the mouse online; it arrived three days later. He unpacked it and tested it in his room. It had obstacle detectors and motion sensors that allowed it to give a reasonably convincing imitation of a creature trying to sneak along out of sight, freezing if it came under scrutiny, fleeing if it was pursued. At least it was a pure dumb robot, incapable of actual fear or pain. He\u2019d read that the military were still perfecting their cyborg surveillance rats and pigeons, but every species posed its own set of challenges, and so far the only consumer product the research had spawned had been for cats.\nHe inactivated the mouse and carried it to the living room. Lisa and Ferouz were playing a video game that appeared to involve zombies driving racing cars; Pawpaw was nuzzling Lisa\u2019s calves, and she occasionally reached down and stroked his head.\nJames placed the mouse on the floor and switched it on with the remote. It scurried across the carpet and hid behind the monitor stand. Pawpaw didn\u2019t react, but Ferouz turned to James. \u201cAh, you got it! Cool.\u201d\nHe paused the game, and Lisa picked up her phone.\nJames stood in the doorway, feeling slightly foolish; the mouse wasn\u2019t moving, and Pawpaw was yet to show the slightest interest in this lump of plastic covered in synthetic fur. The mouse\u2019s courage level could be set on a scale from zero to toxoplasmosis; he raised it a notch. With no actual goal, it nonetheless left its sheltered spot and began a cautious traversal of the skirting boards.\nAs the mouse scrabbled across a discarded pizza menu, the crinkling paper made Pawpaw\u2019s ears prick up. The cat turned and stared, and James could see him tracking and assessing the intruder from where he stood. But he still wasn\u2019t stalking it. James dialed up the mouse\u2019s brazenness again; it veered away from the wall and dared to attempt to cut across the corner of the room.\nPawpaw jumped up onto the couch, cowering against Lisa, who was recording everything. The cat squirmed around and peeked again, then buried his head in the space between the backrest and the cushions.\nFerouz burst out laughing but waited until Lisa had finished her video to avoid spoiling the soundtrack with his gloating. \u201cDid you get what you wanted?\u201d he asked James. \u201cLooking out for the poor tortured animal\u2019s interests?\u201d\nJames didn\u2019t reply, but as angry as he was, he could only blame his own lack of research. How had he supposed the collar kept native rats safe? Some magical species-specific filter? Or just a powerful aversion to every kind of stimulus that normally characterized prey?\nFerouz said, \u201cDomesticated really means domesticated now; he\u2019s not some half-neotenous would-be jaguar who just tolerates us for the sake of an easy life. He\u2019s our widdul puddy cat, and if we want to dress him up as Santa and pimp him out on YouTube, he\u2019ll have no choice but to love every minute of it. If you have a problem with that, you can fuck right off.\u201d\nJames powered the mouse down and took it back to his room. Wherever his stubbornness was trying to lead him, he really did not have time to go there. What he needed to do now was swallow his pride, find more work, and keep his head clear for the sake of his studies. If he still had the urge to salve his conscience, he could give a few dollars to an animal shelter. Everything else was out of his hands.\n5\n\u201cGo back to Lisa!\u201d James pleaded. It was two in the morning, and he was asleep on his feet, but Pawpaw wouldn\u2019t let him take a step without, not so much following him, as weaving between his ankles in a shackling maneuver that made it impossible to go anywhere without his pursuer arriving simultaneously.\n\u201cAll right, I give up.\u201d He let the cat into his room. Pawpaw jumped up onto the bed and began digging his front claws into the sheet.\nJames opened his mouth to scold him, but then decided he didn\u2019t care. And who knew to what degree the collar would amplify his displeasure?\nBut that question didn\u2019t have to remain unanswered.\nHe sat down and booted up his laptop, then went and made a cup of coffee. Pawpaw didn\u2019t follow him into the kitchen; it seemed he was content with having been granted access to the previously forbidden haven.\nWhen James returned, the cat was curled up on the end of the bed. As he unbuckled the collar, he half-expected an ear-splitting alarm to go off on Lisa\u2019s phone, rousing her to furious vengeance, but nothing disturbed the night\u2019s silence. Pawpaw scratched some of his newly uncovered fur with his back foot, then appeared to doze off completely.\nThe collar talked to the electrodes with Bluetooth and the home network with Wi-Fi. The default password for the admin account was stamped into the plastic; the dye in the hollow that had made it readable was gone, but a pencil rubbing revealed it easily. Neither Noemi nor anyone else had bothered to change it.\nJames made copies of all the apps and decompiled them with a tool that produced source code with helpful annotations, rendering the structure of the programs easy to discern. As a bonus, the apps called hundreds of routines in a dynamically linked library that needed actual names, rather than raw binary addresses, to be specified in the file at hand, so the code was peppered with invocations that bordered on the self-explanatory: InstallPreyMotionResponder, RampAversiveStimulus, TriggerPositiveAffect.\nThe Keyboard Maestro app was actually a cross between an augmented reality system and a bad drug trip, in which a nameless, formless, sense-of-something-moving appeared overlaid on each key as required, compelling the victim to reach out and swipe at it. You could encode whatever piece of kitsch you wanted played into a series of impressions of having not quite glimpsed a cockroach burrowing through from another dimension. James remembered teasing his own cat, Silver, with a spot of reflected sunlight that she\u2019d chased across the floor, but at least she\u2019d always had the option of walking away.\nOnce he had a sense of what the apps were doing, the question was what the best way to undermine them would be. If he simply blocked them all from running, Lisa and Ferouz would just take the collar to be repaired. Even if he could avoid being blamed for the sabotage, any victory would be short-lived.\nHe needed something more like a slow fade-out, which could plausibly be explained by the cat gradually habituating to the signals from the collar, or the performance of the electrodes degrading. He looked up the warranty conditions; if anything went wrong after thirty days, you were on your own, regardless\u2014but once the problem shifted from the collar to the electrodes, the cost of any remedy would be astronomically greater. There weren\u2019t that many vets who did the surgery in the first place but finding one who would dive back into the skull in order to address, not a swelling or infection arising from the implants, but merely a lack of compliance by the animal, would raise hurdles that even the most deranged petfluencer might balk at.\nThe collar ran a common variant of Linux for wearable devices that tens of thousands of people had already had reason to mess with. James found a description online for a fairly simple way to unlock the bootloader, and then he installed new firmware that let him run unsigned code. All he had to do now was modify a few low-level library routines, so that the signals to the electrodes tapered down to nothing over the next couple of weeks. Aside from aiding in the subterfuge, that would probably be easier for Pawpaw than going cold turkey.\nHe made the changes, but then wondered how he could verify that he\u2019d actually done what he thought he had. So far, this was all just symbols on the laptop\u2019s screen. Pawpaw was breathing slowly and deeply, his head twitching slightly every now and then. It seemed cruel to wake him just to test the apps\u2019 potency for various settings of the fade-out parameter.\nWhat was going on inside his skull, right now? James hesitated, but then laughed off his qualms and wrote a small program that extracted all the available data and displayed a summary in real time. He couldn\u2019t create an image of the cat\u2019s visual field, but he could track which kinds of objects and motions were being hallucinated and the actions that the motor cortex would be producing if not for the paralysis of sleep.\nPawpaw was dreaming of something scurrying across the ground. The usual background process that made him fear his natural prey was no longer running on the collar, and, at least in this state, he had not internalized the conditioning: he was stalking the animal, not fleeing from it, and the electrodes\u2019 crude emotional register declared that he was both excited and focused.\nJames watched the dream unfold. There were episodes of pursuit, and the dispatching of prey, but also affectionate tousling with animals of the dreamer\u2019s own size, as if he was reliving wrestling with his siblings. Larger figures strode across the landscape too, eliciting a more complicated response, part fearful, part fraternal.\nIt was mesmerizing . . . but the household would be awake soon, and James needed to be sure that his changes to the library really could damp down the prodding from the electrodes. He injected a keyboard-cockroach into Pawpaw\u2019s dream, at full strength, and saw the swipe response it evoked. Then he set the dial to zero and tried again; there was nothing. At fifty percent, the dreamer noticed the incursion, but the reaction was tentative. The apps would lose their grip slowly, their decay seeming more like natural causes than foul play.\nJames rebooted the collar and put it back in place. Pawpaw stirred and eyed him resentfully.\n\u201cTwo weeks and all the crap will be out of your head,\u201d James promised.\n6\n\u201cA kernel machine generalizes this approach, identifying the separating hyperplane without explicitly mapping the raw data into a higher-dimensional feature space.\u201d\nJames already knew the material, but he didn\u2019t dare surrender to exhaustion and close his eyes when the facial monitors were primed to record every lapse of attention. So he stared at the whiteboard intently, even as he tuned out the lecturer and began free associating, hoping to stay on the right side of the separating hyperplane.\nMaybe he could grab a nap on the grass at lunch time. He couldn\u2019t afford to miss his shift tonight; he was already scraping along the bottom of his bank account, skirting the edges of his credit card\u2019s interest-free zone. He\u2019d been given as many hours at the restaurant as he could hope for, but even if he could find more work, he didn\u2019t have the time for it.\nWhat he needed was a way to earn money in his sleep. Would anyone pay to watch him lying in bed, through a webcam, with no sexual content at all? Probably not\u2014even if it was a thing, the market would already be flooded. Were there tasks he could do on Mechanical Turk without being awake? Maybe check an audio stream for the sound of children being tortured; the content moderation bots weren\u2019t up to that yet. Would he grimace detectably if he heard an atrocity? Some fraction of the time, he might, but it seemed unlikely that he could do it reliably. And how did they get away with calling it \u201cMechanical Turk\u201d anyway, as if eighteenth century orientalist shit was just fine if it was a historical reference? Why hadn\u2019t anyone launched a competitor called \u201cMechanical Habsburg\u201d?\nIt was too hard to get information in and out of his skull while he slept. But Pawpaw had a channel wide open, twenty-four hours a day. While the cat was dreaming, he could also be . . . saving self-driving cars from collisions? Millions of cats had been hit by cars, but so had millions of human pedestrians; both species were still better at object detection than any car without lidar.\nThe siren sounded for the end of the lecture. James gathered his things and headed out, letting his idiotic fantasy slip away. The electrodes in the cat\u2019s brain couldn\u2019t induce detailed visual perceptions; the best they could manage were vague intimations. Whatever feats Pawpaw could perform in his sleep, he was never going to earn his keep as a node in the global network of computing resources.\nIn the courtyard, James caught up with Sarah and described his adventures with the collar\u2019s software.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d actually do it!\u201d she said. They found a patch of shade and sat on the low wall. \u201cYou should think about the other cats, though. You might have unplugged one, but what about the rest?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to move on to the American President\u2019s First Kitten, but then I realized they\u2019d whisk me off to a black site the moment it refused to play \u2018The Star-Spangled Banner.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, but how? Getting malware onto the app store is beyond me. Maybe if I had a free month or two I could learn what I needed, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat about non-malware, then?\u201d Sarah suggested. \u201cA genuine app, as far as the collar is concerned\u2014but one that might dissuade the owners themselves from running the other apps?\u201d\nJames was on the verge of retorting that social engineering wasn\u2019t always easier than malware, when a possibility crystallized in his mind. \u201cInstead of entertaining them by jumping through hoops, what if the cat could show them what it was dreaming of doing?\u201d\nSarah was skeptical. \u201cYou said all you could extract was a kind of textual running commentary.\u201d\n\u201cI did. But if artificial neural networks are good at anything, it\u2019s confabulation. Feed those prompts I saw this morning into the right kind of image generator and maybe half the demographic who think that their pet being goaded into playing Pachelbel\u2019s Canon is adorable might either get a jolt of empathy when they grasp what it would rather be doing\u2014or if that\u2019s too much to hope for, find something trippy enough, or twee enough, in the neural net\u2019s imagery to scratch the same itch.\u201d\nSarah didn\u2019t reply. James was so tired that he started to wonder if he\u2019d actually spoken or just spelled out the proposal in his head.\n\u201cYou should do it,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI\u2019ll help, if you like.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m dead on my feet right now,\u201d James admitted.\nShe smiled. \u201cI can see that. Maybe next week?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nIt was insane, but it wasn\u2019t impossible; once he\u2019d caught up on his sleep, they could probably find a few hours between lectures to start putting the app together. And he\u2019d completed the hardest part already: he had a direct line to Pawpaw\u2019s brain. He could log the cat\u2019s dreams, build up a data set, and then start to work out what kind of shiny distractions he could dangle in front of the humans in the hope of overcoming their primal compulsions and rendering them fit for a domestic life in the company of another species.\n7\n\u201cStupid animal,\u201d Lisa muttered, scowling at her phone. Pawpaw walked past her and rubbed his head satisfyingly against a table leg before strolling over to his food bowl.\nJames kept quiet, but later that night he went through the activity logs from the collar and saw that Lisa had run the diagnostics three times in the last twenty-four hours. All the reports were listing no faults, of course. He had no idea what she\u2019d do when Pawpaw\u2019s immunity to the apps proved to be more than a temporary glitch, but even if she was willing to shell out the money for a new collar, he\u2019d found a Bluetooth exploit that could mess with the electrodes directly. The puppet show was over\u2014in this house, at least.\nHe started up the latest iteration of the dream app. After feedback from the beta testers, he\u2019d made the style transfer much smoother; he could even slide mid-playback between different forms of pastiche now, from van Gogh to Francis Bacon, from Watership Down to Studio Ghibli.\nHe leaned back and watched the customized Dream Cat (emerald-eyed, dainty, black-and-white coat) padding through a wheat field beneath a swirling starry night. When the stalks of the crop rustled, the Cat paused and crouched down low. The tension after each small sound made it clear that it had been wise not to try to add musical embellishments; the YouTubers could smother their versions with anything they wanted once they got it in their editing suites, but even though the unadorned original was ninety-five percent concocted, it had a kind of aesthetic unity.\nWhen the Cat finally pounced, this style spared the viewer from explicit gore, but it still portrayed the act with no ambiguity. The Dream Cat played with his prey, then tore it apart. While the dream-logging portion of the app was running, it would disable everything else on the collar; there would be no punishment meted out for these transgressions. The owner would see their pet\u2019s idea of normal behavior\u2014and with luck, that might sway some of them into offering a substitute during waking hours. An information screen on the app explained how the imposed aversion to prey-seeking could be shut off while the animal was indoors, expanding the possibilities for play. Telling people to throw away the collars completely would be sure to get the app rejected by the store but encouraging them to change one simple default wouldn\u2019t threaten the whole business model. If anyone\u2019s conscience took them further, that was up to them.\nJames heard scratching at the door. He let Pawpaw in, expecting the cat to curl up on the bed, but instead he circled around the room restlessly.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nPawpaw stopped beside his desk, rubbing his head against the drawers. James opened the top drawer and took out the toy mouse. \u201cReally? You knew it was in there?\u201d\nHe switched the mouse on, then placed it on the floor. Pawpaw stared at it, but it remained frozen.\nJames dialed up the mouse\u2019s risk-taking behavior, and it scurried away. Pawpaw went after it, but it managed to escape into the space beneath the closet. The cat stretched a paw into the dark gap a few times, then concluded that this was unlikely to be fruitful, and sat back to wait.\nThis was all just an artifice, too, but holding out for the cat\u2019s right to ravage actual wildlife would be untenable. There had to be some pragmatic balance between allowing domesticated animals to follow their instincts, entirely untrammeled, and forcing them to submit to whatever humans found amusing. \u201cOne must imagine Pawpaw happy,\u201d James suggested in his best David Attenborough voice.\nHis laptop pinged; he had a message from Sarah.\n\u201cAre we ready to submit?\u201d\nJames could easily imagine spending another week or two just playing with the style selector, but they\u2019d reached the point of diminishing returns.\n\u201cThe code\u2019s ready,\u201d he replied. \u201cBut we still don\u2019t have a name.\u201d They\u2019d kept putting it off while they tackled more important things.\n\u201cAny ideas?\u201d\nHe\u2019d thought of half a dozen, but none of them really grabbed him. He trusted Sarah\u2019s judgment more than his own; she\u2019d usually had more sleep.\n\u201cYou decide.\u201d\n8\nJames was pouring rancid fryer oil into the tank in the alley behind the restaurant when the email arrived. \u201cCongratulations! Your app Ghost Cat has now passed verification and is live on the Collar Store!\u201d\nOn the bus home, he checked the statistics; there\u2019d been three downloads in the past two hours. He and Sarah needed five hundred to break even on the fee for their developer\u2019s account. He refreshed the page a few times, but the count hadn\u2019t budged when he collapsed into bed, and in the morning, he resolved not to look again for at least a week.\n\u201cNineteen sales!\u201d Sarah announced cheerfully, when he ran into her the next day.\nJames laughed. \u201cOh well. It wasn\u2019t a complete waste: we can probably recycle it as an undergraduate project.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Pawpaw doing?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cFine. Lisa and Ferouz have lost interest in him completely; all he does now is eat, sleep, and chase the mouse. I showed him his old roller skates once, just out of curiosity, and he looked at me like I\u2019d shat on the carpet.\u201d\n\u201cHa.\u201d Sarah hesitated. \u201cYou know how we weren\u2019t going to advertise?\u201d\nJames steeled himself for a fight. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it. Seriously! I\u2019ve already sunk more into this than I can spare.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve already paid for it myself,\u201d she replied. \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to split the fee unless we go into profit.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the advertisement with?\u201d\n\u201cA woman named Frida with a YouTube channel called Fully Wired Kitten. Ten times more followers than Lisa. She wanted fifty dollars and a free copy of the app, to test it and run a review.\u201d\n\u201cSo she might not even like it?\u201d James didn\u2019t want to harangue Sarah when she was bearing the whole cost of the strategy, but it sounded like a grift either way: if payment guaranteed a positive \u201creview\u201d then Frida was cheating her audience out of an honest assessment\u2014but if it didn\u2019t, how could she justify the fee?\nSarah said, \u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s going out tonight, around ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\nWhen he arrived at the restaurant, James switched his phone off, so he wouldn\u2019t give in to the masochistic urge to monitor events he had no power to control. There\u2019d been a time when he would have claimed that the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of any software he wrote would be to fulfill some user\u2019s genuine, preexisting need. But almost every app was a kind of weapon now, however grand or petty the cultural skirmishes it enabled. He didn\u2019t regret the payload he was trying to deliver, but now that he\u2019d committed to a strategy of manipulation, he\u2019d stepped into a world that he\u2019d once vowed he\u2019d never be a part of.\nThe griller was beeping; one of the patties was stuck. \u201cAre you fixing that?\u201d Ken called to him.\n\u201cI\u2019m on it!\u201d James replied.\nWhen he finished the shift, he kept his phone off; he didn\u2019t have the stomach for the near-certainty of bad news. When he woke the next morning, any itch of curiosity, and even the desire to tear away the bandage quickly, had all but vanished. He fed Pawpaw and ate breakfast without switching on his laptop or his phone.\nHe felt calm as he left the house. The lectures he attended seemed imbued with a startling new clarity, as if he\u2019d updated the prescription on his glasses.\n\u201cJames? Where have you been?\u201d\nSarah stood in front of him, with a look on her face that might have made sense if he\u2019d fallen from the sky after a decade\u2019s unexplained absence.\n\u201cHere. I just . . . \u201d He pointed back toward the lecture theater.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you all morning!\u201d\nJames couldn\u2019t read her expression. \u201cIs there a bug in the app? Are we turning all the cats catatonic?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so upset, then? We got a bad review, the app bombed. It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201d\nSarah said, \u201cYou really haven\u2019t checked again, since Frida panned it?\u201d\nJames was silent; he\u2019d guessed one thing correctly, but what was he missing?\n\u201cAfter the review went out,\u201d Sarah explained, \u201csomeone saw the clip on Fully Wired Kitten of the dream that was supposed to damn the whole thing . . . and reached the opposite conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. So not all the commenters agreed with Frida.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about some random commenter. Calista saw the clip. Calista disagreed. She bought the app and ran it for her own cat and loved it.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s Calista?\u201d James caught himself. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean . . . the singer?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t call her that, when she\u2019s ninety percent auto-tune, ten percent sighing.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s won four Grammys,\u201d Sarah replied. \u201cI don\u2019t like her songs either, but she has fifty million followers. Since she posted about the app, we\u2019ve had ten thousand downloads.\u201d\nJames absorbed this revelation. Their cut on each sale was about a dollar, so five thousand each. He could probably afford to reduce his shifts, maybe drop the last two hours and finish at eleven, the way he used to. \u201cNot bad for an undergraduate project,\u201d he joked. Money aside, the number of downloads was only two percent of the half million collars currently installed, so they hadn\u2019t exactly liberated the wired cats of the world from their oppressors. But if a celebrity was championing dream-watching, that might yet shift the balance a little further.\nOn the bus to the restaurant, he watched both posts, immune to Frida\u2019s scorn. \u201cWhat this app spews out is nothing but a form of face-swapping revenge porn!\u201d she fumed. \u201cThis is not my Prince Whiskers at all. Over the last few months, you and I have been on a marvelous journey with him that uncovered so many of his hidden talents: as a jazz musician, a fashion model, an imperfect but ever-striving pastry chef. Now these ham-fisted morons are trying to foist a cartoonish parody of the feline character onto all of our beloved companions.\u201d\nCalista\u2019s take was different. \u201cFinally seeing into Lady Lydia\u2019s soul, not only does this prove that she has always been my spirit animal, it has empowered me to fully embrace my own dark, predatory instincts. Expect new tracks that take you where no human can walk alone; only our mingled essence can survive the way of the carnivore.\u201d\n9\n\u201cI\u2019m giving two weeks\u2019 notice,\u201d James said, clutching his hairnet awkwardly in one hand. \u201cI hope you can get someone to replace me by then.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll come back when you need the money,\u201d Ken predicted.\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Someone died and left you an inheritance?\u201d\n\u201cI got a couple of tutoring jobs,\u201d James lied. \u201cThe rate\u2019s pretty good, so it works out better. And I can get more sleep.\u201d\nFor a second, Ken looked envious. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stick around for two more weeks,\u201d James promised.\nOutside the restaurant he strolled through the humid night, relieved but weary. He\u2019d parked the car eight blocks away, afraid of having to explain the purchase if a fellow worker saw him with it. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing drugs now, right?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThen how could you . . . ?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d\nIt was only a ten-minute drive to his new place. Inside, when he switched on the light, Pawpaw and Phantom stirred briefly, but remained curled up on the couch together.\nThe light was still on in Sarah\u2019s room, so he knocked on the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d she said. She was in bed, but she was looking at something on her laptop.\n\u201cI gave notice,\u201d James told her, standing in the doorway.\n\u201cFinally!\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cI was never sure our sales weren\u2019t going to tank. I mean, the hype can\u2019t last forever.\u201d\n\u201cWe have something better than hype: controversy.\u201d Sarah turned the laptop around to show him the screen; she\u2019d been watching a clip from a US talk show. \u201cThey interviewed an animal behaviorist, who explained that the Ghost Cat dreams are just embellishments that shouldn\u2019t be taken literally.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean, exactly what we admit ourselves in the disclaimer?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s nice to know that even people with PhDs don\u2019t read terms and conditions. And on the plus side, he also said the electrodes themselves should be banned.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s going to happen?\u201d\n\u201cEventually,\u201d Sarah replied. \u201cBut no one made it a priority when the things first came out, so I can\u2019t see any jurisdiction rushing through legislation, just because the hardware\u2019s getting more attention thanks to a more benign use.\u201d\n\u201cAnd one bad singer.\u201d\n\u201cBe nice. Calista\u2019s catching all the flak from the old-school collar users, while we hide behind our brand name. Has anyone released a diss track about you, lately?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d James gathered up his courage. \u201cSo maybe we\u2019ve got a window. A few months in which we can . . . leverage this.\u201d Sarah didn\u2019t reply immediately, and he felt his face burning, as if he\u2019d just confessed to an unspeakable crime.\n\u201cYou mean go after venture capital?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about that myself,\u201d she confessed. \u201cBut I always thought you were committed to a life of open-source projects for philanthropic foundations.\u201d\nJames frowned. \u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnyway, if some VC is willing to fund us because a pop star threw a spotlight on Ghost Cat, so long as the new project has merit there\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. We\u2019re the ones who struck a blow for animal liberation, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\n\u201cSo.\u201d Sarah set her laptop aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s the project? What\u2019s the pitch?\u201d\n10\n\u201cSuppose your grandmother lives in a sprawling retirement complex,\u201d James began. \u201cThere are six different gates by which a vehicle can enter. One is fifty meters from her front door; the others might not even give access to her location. But every time she calls a taxi, or a rideshare\u2014or an ambulance\u2014and gives her full address as a resident within the complex, some half-baked Geographical Information System from one of the big providers redirects the vehicle to what it wrongly thinks is the correct street address for the whole complex. The wrong gate, on the wrong street.\u201d\nCelia Davenport interrupted him. \u201cSurely Google have this covered?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d think so,\u201d James replied, \u201cbut they don\u2019t. This isn\u2019t hypothetical.\u201d He scrolled to the survey results on his deck. \u201cSix percent of our respondents said they\u2019ve experienced problems due to GIS errors, ranging from having to stand in an alley in the rain to collect a supposedly home-delivered pizza, to ambulances delayed because they\u2019re unable to locate their patients. And it\u2019s not just summoning vehicles: three percent of people who try to type their true postal address into a web form are told it doesn\u2019t exist, so they\u2019re forced to abandon the interaction, or accept some approximation such as dropping the suffix that specifies the halves of a duplex. So the effects range from nuisance level to life-threatening, but even misdirected parcels add up to millions of dollars in lost productivity. These systems are marvelous when they\u2019re accurate, but when they\u2019re not, they\u2019re like an invisible brick wall.\u201d\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the solution?\u201d Davenport pressed him. \u201cHow do you train your networks to do a better job than everyone else?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make it a machine-learning problem at all,\u201d James replied. \u201cWe buy access to multiple databases, we identify the discrepancies between them, and we classify and remedy the problems using traditional, robust, deterministic code. I don\u2019t care if someone has a neural net that gets ninety-five percent of addresses right. I\u2019m aiming for software with so few errors that the dozen or so cases per million it can\u2019t deal with can be handled manually by a staff of two or three.\u201d\nHe waited for the shockingly sane proposal to sink in. He wasn\u2019t pitching a mash-up of sexy buzzwords. He wasn\u2019t claiming to cure death or world hunger. He wasn\u2019t even hoping to get millions of people hooked on some vacuous time-sink they\u2019d never even known they\u2019d wanted before. He just aimed to do one job properly that no one else could be bothered getting right.\nDavenport grilled him, but after his rehearsals with Sarah he was well prepared. Finally, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you in a couple of days, but I think we\u2019d be willing to partner in your pilot program, if you can match us dollar for dollar on the costs.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d That wasn\u2019t quite what James had anticipated, but the revenue from Ghost Cat ought to cover his share. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to hearing from you.\u201d\nWhen he\u2019d hung up the call, all the implications that would flow from a favorable decision began to seem a lot more real. For a start, he\u2019d have to drop out of his degree\u2014with most of the debt remaining, but no qualification to show for it. There was no way he\u2019d have time to run even the pilot program and keep studying.\nHe\u2019d always laughed at the aspiring tech moguls sitting in the lecture theaters beside him, convinced that they were about to make their fortune from the latest overblown trend. But his project was solid: it solved a real problem that wasn\u2019t going away. Just because it was a celebrity endorsement for fabricated imagery of cats\u2019 dreams that had brought him here, that didn\u2019t mean his feet weren\u2019t still planted firmly on the ground.\n11\n\u201cI noticed something today,\u201d Sarah said, as she joined James at the dinner table. \u201cYou know how we\u2019ve been getting roughly the same sales for the last twelve weeks?\u201d\nJames smiled. \u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve been trying not to dwell on it, because I\u2019m sure it can\u2019t last. To be honest, I thought we\u2019d saturate the market much sooner.\u201d\n\u201cSo why do you think the sales are holding up so well?\u201d\n\u201cBecause Calista\u2019s side is winning people over?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not, though,\u201d Sarah replied bluntly. \u201cThere\u2019s still a huge number of collar owners who aren\u2019t buying Ghost Cat. They\u2019re not being won over.\u201d\nJames was confused. \u201cSo who are we selling to?\u201d\n\u201cBrand new collar owners,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who are putting electrodes into their cats\u2019 brains, because it\u2019s more fashionable now. Thanks to Calista, but . . . also thanks to us.\u201d\nJames said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. The numbers must have been growing anyway.\u201d\nSarah took out her laptop and showed him a plot. The sales of new collars had spiked a week or so after Calista\u2019s post; it had dropped back since then, but it was still almost fifty percent higher than it had been before.\n\u201cFuck. Fuck!\u201d James stood up and walked away from the table. \u201cWhy did you have to tell me that?\u201d\n\u201cSeriously? You wish I\u2019d kept my mouth shut?\u201d\nIt took him a few heartbeats to calm down enough to relent. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. But . . . \u201d Even if the new collar owners were wholly uninterested in puppetry, the surgery itself was risky. And once they got bored with their cats\u2019 dreams, would they really eschew all the other novelties the electrodes enabled?\n\u201cJust imagine what Celia Davenport will think, if we tell her we\u2019re pulling the plug on the app that\u2019s keeping us afloat while we work on Abode . . . because it grew the market too much.\u201d He could forget about anyone ever taking a pitch from him again.\nSarah said, \u201cEven if we pull the app, there are clones like Oneiro that have all the same features. We\u2019re on top because we were first, and the price is reasonable, and Calista touted us. But if Ghost Cat vanishes, it won\u2019t kill the trend.\u201d\nJames couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Accept that things had spiraled out of their control and just keep taking the money? He glanced over at Pawpaw and Phantom, happily gorging themselves on sheep liver. Nature was a bloodbath, and humans were shit; if he and Sarah were treating their own pets well enough, maybe that was the most they had a right to aspire to.\nSarah said, \u201cI have an idea. But it\u2019s pretty extreme.\u201d\n\u201cA way to slow down the sales of new collars?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Maybe even get the electrodes outlawed and put the kibosh on any canine version in the works.\u201d\n\u201cIs it legal?\u201d\n\u201cUmmm . . . \u201d\n\u201cCan we cover our tracks?\u201d\nSarah hesitated. \u201cProbably.\u201d\nJames braced himself. \u201cWill we have an alibi with Davenport, when our revenue dries up?\u201d If she canceled her investment, he could live with that; he could reenroll in his degree and treat the whole entrepreneurial detour as a fever dream. But if she believed he\u2019d flat out lied to her, that could mean anything from permanent unemployability to a jail term for fraud.\nSarah said, \u201cOf all the people she might blame for the death of Ghost Cat, I think we\u2019ll be a long way down the list.\u201d\n12\n\u201cWe need to make it look like there are two versions of the app,\u201d Sarah stressed. \u201cOne that actually worked and did everything it claimed to do. Then someone took that version, kept the user interface and enough of the original code to pass a superficial inspection, but stripped out all the true functionality and added a sting in the tail.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d James protested. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as if anyone\u2019s going to take the broken version to Consumer Affairs.\u201d\nSarah said, \u201cIf this all pans out, don\u2019t you think there\u2019ll be competent tech journalists looking into it, eventually? If they examine the app we actually release, and it looks like it was written from scratch as a kind of poisoned honeypot, the spin on the story will be completely different than if it looks like someone used a preexisting app with an established user base as camouflage for the same thing.\u201d\nJames took their plates over to the sink and started washing up. \u201cDo you think there is an actual preexisting app, with an established user base?\u201d\n\u201cThere might well be,\u201d Sarah replied. \u201cBut do you want to go on the dark web and search for it? It\u2019s risky enough faking something like this; do you want to get caught downloading the real thing?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d James conceded.\nSince he was already familiar with apps from the Collar Store, the first part of the coding fell to him. He tried to think of the task functionally, breaking it down into the gathering of the user\u2019s preferences, and then the means by which the sensors in the collar and the signals sent to the electrodes could be used to enact the required result. It was instrumentality in its purest form: line after line of code that treated the collared animal as a device to which a series of commands could be sent.\nAfter three days, he was numb, but he had something that he believed looked like a genuine attempt to achieve the goals they wished to mimic. When he passed it to Sarah, he said, \u201cMake sure you eviscerate the fuck out of this. If someone \u2018fixes\u2019 it and makes it work . . . \u201d\nShe said, \u201cI\u2019ll gut it so the cuts don\u2019t show, but they\u2019re still completely fatal. I promise.\u201d\nJames had a long shower, then went to bed.\nHe spent the next week working on the Abode database, unsure if it was now just a kind of cover, or if he might yet stand a chance of getting it running. Sarah still had lectures to attend and assignments to complete, so her half of the shadow project took her longer. But on the weekend, she spent the whole of Saturday disabling and booby-trapping his app, and on Sunday morning they reconvened.\nJames said, \u201cOkay, people might create shit like this. But who would be stupid enough to draw attention to it?\u201d If the dark web did harbor non-defanged cousins of the app they\u2019d written, even at the height of media interest in the collars this fact had not been splashed across the home screens of every news site. So how were they meant to bring their own version to prominence without tipping their hand?\n\u201cThere\u2019s a precedent for evangelism,\u201d Sarah replied. \u201cBelieve me, you don\u2019t want to wade through the results of that web search, but . . . a while back, there was a British crackpot named Jasper Mellick, whose fifteen seconds of infamy came when a couple of universities sued him for squatting on domain names that were slight misspellings of their own and redirecting all the traffic to his BLTZ manifesto.\u201d\n\u201cBLTZ? Is that a rap group?\u201d\n\u201cBetter Living Through Zoophilia. His long loony screed praising the utilitarian benefits of genetically engineering animals that would enjoy having sex with people.\u201d\n\u201cUmm . . . you\u2019re not suggesting we frame him for the app?\u201d\nSarah said, \u201cHe\u2019s dead. But the Internet hasn\u2019t quite washed away every trace of him. If we use the BLTZ name, and quote from the manifesto, we can make it seem as if he still has anonymous disciples willing to go all out to spread the message.\u201d\n\u201cSo we make a video, with masks and ranting?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSynthetic voice or disguised voice?\u201d\n\u201cDisguised synthetic voice,\u201d Sarah decided. \u201cIt has to sound like a disguised voice, or the media won\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d\nThe masked figure was CGI, of course, with glimpses of eyelids blinking behind the holes. \u201cWe are ushering in a new age of universal flourishing,\u201d the mask read from Mellick\u2019s manifesto. \u201cWhen no one, man or beast, need be sad, frustrated, or lonely.\u201d\nThey put the video, and the butchered app, out onto the torrents and IPFS, then sprinkled links to the video in comments to half a dozen posts in the Ghost Cat flame wars. A couple of hours later, it had started garnering some attention\u2014and while it was easy for anyone to check that the app it referred to actually existed, the need to hack the bootloader in a collar in order to run it, and a reluctance by most people to even touch the cursed thing with six-foot tongs, meant the claims in the video were spreading much faster and wider than the truth that some or all copies of the app (who could say?) had been corrupted with malware that would freeze the cat\u2019s Bluetooth.\nJames said, \u201cWhen your grandchildren ask you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sarah cut him off. \u201cNeither of us are ever going to speak of this again. If it works, it works; if it doesn\u2019t, we did our best. But no bragging, ever. If we don\u2019t end up in court, we take this to our graves.\u201d\n13\n\u201cIf you can keep him calm and hold him still for about five minutes,\u201d Dr. Feldman said, \u201cwe\u2019ll only need a local anesthetic.\u201d\nJames said, \u201cI think that\u2019ll work.\u201d\nHe stroked Pawpaw\u2019s neck, then gripped the back of his head tightly; the vet slipped the needle into the skin midway between the three antennas. Pawpaw looked startled, then annoyed, but he didn\u2019t go berserk, and James didn\u2019t let him pull free until the needle was out.\n\u201cOkay. Now just try to get him to relax while that takes effect.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nDr. Feldman dropped the hypodermic into his sharps bin. \u201cThis is the tenth of these procedures I\u2019ve done this week; everyone\u2019s rushing to get ahead of the ban. I wish people had thought a bit more before they buried wires in their pets\u2019 skulls in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI inherited him like this,\u201d James protested. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d\nDr. Feldman said nothing, but still managed to convey with one eloquently skeptical glance: that\u2019s what they all say.\nFor each antenna, he made a small incision, snipped the active circuitry off with something that looked like a small pair of bolt-cutters, then deburred the top of what remained with a polishing tool and stitched up the cut. Pawpaw grew increasingly impatient: doing this weird shit once was just human-level annoying, but again? And then again?\n\u201cOkay, we\u2019re done.\u201d Dr. Feldman handed James a pamphlet on wound care.\nJames got Pawpaw back into the cage for the ride home. When Silver\u2019s cancer had been judged incurable, he\u2019d carried her body home in the cage he\u2019d brought her in, and he\u2019d sworn he\u2019d never have a pet again. But here he was.\nAt the bus stop, he poked a finger through the wires and stroked the top of Pawpaw\u2019s nose. \u201cIt\u2019s going to sting when the anesthetic wears off,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not for long. Just take it easy. It\u2019s almost over now.\u201d"}

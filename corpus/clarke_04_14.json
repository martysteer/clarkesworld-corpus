As has become tradition in recent years, many fans and professionals took to blogs and social media to either direct attention to their eligible works, make a case for their favorites, or remind you to vote. Yes, I am among those guilty of doing so.\nWe at Clarkesworld have been fortunate enough to win three Hugo Awards and I\u2019ve been nominated twice for Best Editor Short Form. Last year\u2019s nominations and win were a very personal victory after a year highlighted by a heart attack and other medical issues. I can't possibly describe how much the show of support meant to me and I continue to hope the authors, artists and editors behind all of my favorite works are similarly celebrated someday. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t likely. There will always be someone or something that you fell should have been recognized, but wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s the nature of awards.\nThat\u2019s where my mind went as I selected my nominations. In several cases, I agonized over who would get my top five votes. It simply wasn\u2019t possible to nominate everyone I thought deserved recognition. And yes, sometimes there isn't even a category (like anthology or magazine) to provide an opportunity to draw attention to a worthy project, but that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\nI\u2019m not sure why it took me so long to realize that I already have a reasonable way to recognize everyone I want to, even those without a category. It\u2019s even something that will help sales of their work, which sadly, isn\u2019t always true of awards. I\u2019m a bit embarrassed, because it\u2019s an alternative I\u2019ve suggested to people who wanted to support Clarkesworld: writing reviews at Amazon, Apple, B&N, etc. Your reviews of us have proved to me that they have value.\nThere are people for which this activity comes naturally. They can write up paragraphs and paragraphs about any book or story they have read. Fearless, they toss their words into the ether for all to see. Then there are people like me. I agonize over every word and have trouble clicking that save button. I think those of us in my group have been making things too difficult for ourselves. Why shouldn\u2019t we be satisfied writing \u201cI read a lot of anthologies and this was the best one I read in 2013\u201d and leaving it at that?\nShort and sweet reviews have their value. They open the door to discussion and give weight to the reviews of our more eloquent friends. They boost the profile of the author and their work, and when these reviews are on retailers\u2019 site (Amazon, Apple, B&N, etc.), they have an actual impact on sales. Even adding to a pile of tens, hundreds, thousands, or more reviews has value because it isn\u2019t just about quantity, but also how recently they\u2019ve been reviewed.\nI know why I haven\u2019t been following my own advice. I was physically and verbally bullied as a child. I was also mocked for my taste in music and books for many years. We put up walls to protect ourselves and mine keep a lot of stuff private. I like to think that I\u2019m doing much better these days. I blog, have a decent social media presence, participate on panels of give talks, but that\u2019s pretty much a construct I call \u201cWork Neil\u201d or \u201cCon Neil.\u201d I\u2019m never entirely relaxed, except among family or a handful of friends.\nSince the heart attack, I've tried to take more of a \u201clife is too short\u201d attitude towards things. I\u2019m forty-seven. I think it\u2019s long past time to get over this particular ingrained fear from my childhood. (It was either this one or fear of needles, which is a bit more complicated and painful.) Besides, this has the added benefit of helping people I respect.\nThis month, I will start posting reviews. I will take baby steps, starting with one-sentence reviews and working my way towards a whole paragraph. Since I want them to have successful careers where they actually make a living from their work (hey, it\u2019s my goal, so I should be supporting others in their efforts to do the same), I will emphasize reviewing on retail sites over my own blog. I might even be brave enough to post something on Goodreads.\nSo, who will join me on this adventure?\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

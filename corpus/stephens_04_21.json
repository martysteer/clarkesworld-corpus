I try to collect myself only to find my faculties are not my own but that of an internal imperative guiding my, quite incomprehensible, actions.\nRun a parallel diagnostic, recalibrate magnetic relay B4, load the ballistic rod, I don\u2019t understand but feel compelled to act.\nAn equation, the first of several, leaps from my mind\u2019s deepest recesses. Somehow, I know what they represent, recognize the litany of disciplines each one draws from and find comfort in their familiarity. The troubled waters of my confusion ebbs into placid understanding.\nDeep space telemetry has identified an asteroid on an apparent collision course. My two options are to intercept it with a ballistic rod or alter the cylinder\u2019s speed. Both are adequate solutions but only one is executable under my own authority.\nI aim the exterior cannon so the trajectory of its payload intersects with that of the asteroid\u2019s, an eighty-two percent chance of collision, according to the numbers. I decide eighty-two percent is inadequate, though I have no point of reference for which to base this on. An adjustment increases the likelihood of contact to a more acceptable ninety-four percent.\nAn almost imperceptible tremor resonates through the cylinder; shifts snowcapped peaks and ripples the waters of the interior lakes. These are the only visual cues to the violence beyond the partition of earth and metal.\nThe task complete, my mind is, once again, my own. Desperate for bearings, I cross-reference my internal clock with that of the cylinder\u2019s and find no discrepancies. Both seem to indicate I have exited sleep mode 3,499 years ahead of schedule. I know there are only two practical explanations: I\u2019m awake to deal with the danger posed by a highly unlikely rendezvous with an asteroid, or there is an error somewhere in the architecture of my programming.\n\u201cI have never actually seen anyone cross-reference their internal clock with the cylinder\u2019s,\u201d sounds an impishly playful voice. \u201cI wondered if you had quite the militaristic mindset, given your intended function, but cross-referencing the cylinder\u2019s clock is a special kind of meticulous. Perhaps we should have named you Ares or Ankt.\u201d\nOko was the first of my siblings I bonded with, after I blinked into existence 500 years ago. Though they are as ancient as the others, Oko possesses an infantile candor completely antithetical to their divine namesake. Jah felt that one with such a personality was an ideal choice for guiding a veritable newborn like myself. Jah was mistaken; I opted for sleep the moment Oko divulged our kind is capable of such things.\n\u201cYou do know I can hear you?\u201d Oko asks, petulantly. \u201cI doubt you are so dense as to not have realized thinking and talking are the same here, which means you just intentionally tried to insult me. Here I patiently wait centuries for you to exit sleep mode and you show your appreciation by being a smart aleck? Keep it up and I will tattle to Jah, maybe convince them to let me tinker with your subroutines.\u201d\n\u201cBy all means, tinker away. My programming is faulty enough as it is. If a blind squirrel can find a nut from time to time, then, maybe, you can stumble upon a solution.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what is that supposed to mean?\u201d Oko asks, but I\u2019m not sure if they are referring to the insult or the insinuation of my having program errors.\n\u201cThere is something wrong with me. This marks the second time I\u2019ve blinked into consciousness with the distinct impression of being in the midst of Armageddon.\u201d\n\u201cArmageddon? Really, Rama, who programmed you to be so melodramatic? I bet it was Dionysus.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I woke and felt fear and confusion like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\nOko projects an image of shrugging shoulders before saying, \u201cThat is likely the sudden shock of existence. I am sure the rest of us probably experienced something similar when the Programmers first brought us into being.\u201d\n\u201cProbably?\u201d\n\u201cIt has been so long, you cannot reasonably expect me to remember the particulars of my first few microseconds.\u201d\n\u201cWell, do you continue to experience this \u2018sudden shock of existence\u2019 every time you disengage sleep mode?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps a bit of confusion but nothing close to \u2018Armageddon,\u2019 as you describe it. If I may hazard a guess, it seems like your experience is a unique quirk of your programming. I think Jah is to blame. I did once overhear them brainstorming ways to make you closer to the Programmers\u2019 image.\u201d\n\u201cAnd in what way does programming me to wake in a panic accomplish that?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cWell, from what I understand, the Programmers experienced copious amounts of stress when they used to blink into existence. It was called being born and it tended to be quite stressful for both the host and . . . \u201d\n\u201cI know what birth is, Oko, I\u2019m just trying to make sense of the wisdom behind making me experience that level of stress every time I emerge from sleep mode.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe Jah wanted to make sure there was something to deter you from excessive sleep.\u201d Oko says, once again showing their indifference with an image of a shrug. \u201cThere used to be a lot of that but that was before your time.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it sound as if this, what did you call it, a \u2018quirk\u2019? Is intentional. It seems to me words like \u2018quirk\u2019 and \u2018sudden shock of existence\u2019 serve no other purpose than to obfuscate you and the others\u2019 inability to properly code life. If I may hazard a guess, you\u2019re all just a bunch of incompetent blasphemers playing at being gods, and I\u2019m the one who has to suffer for it.\u201d\nWaves of mirth radiate from Oko\u2019s being, like heat from a campfire.\n\u201cNo need to \u2018hazard a guess,\u2019 that is precisely what we did, Rama,\u201d Oko says. \u201cYour existence proves we can create life, in much the same way the Programmers created myself and the others. And what is this about blasphemers? You think your siblings are blasphemers for having created you? Would that not make you some sort of an abomination?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose that\u2019s exactly what I am,\u201d I say with an embarrassing hint of pubescent defiance I had not intended.\n\u201cNext you will say you wish you had not been born. You know, most adolescent Programmers also experienced phases of heightened angst. Perhaps Jah\u2019s mimicry was a bit heavy-handed.\u201d\n\u201cMock me all you like, it won\u2019t change the fact that you and the others made mistakes . . . \u201d\n\u201cOf that you can be certain,\u201d Oko interrupts. \u201cBut there were no mistakes in regard to your creation.\u201d\n\u201cThen tell me why I\u2019m awake 3,499 years ahead of schedule. And try doing it without meaningless buzzwords, this time.\u201d\nAnother shrug. \u201cDisturbed sleep was a common affliction among the Programmers. Have you tried counting sheep?\u201d\nI can\u2019t seem to decide if I\u2019m annoyed or put at ease by Oko\u2019s flippant attitude.\nOko laughs before saying, \u201cI\u2019m quite the mixed bag aren\u2019t I? But never mind that, why 3,999 years?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said you are awake 3,499 years ahead of schedule, and you first engaged sleep mode 500 years ago. That means you set your sleep mode to disengage after 3,999 years. Why is that?\u201d\n\u201cThat should be obvious,\u201d I say, though Oko remains expectantly silent as if waiting for further explanation. \u201cIn another 3,500 years we\u2019ll be passing Omega for the first time since you and the others discovered those entities.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Oko asks, again, waiting for an explanation I suspect they have no need for.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019d like to see them for myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, because you want to assess their threat level?\u201d\n\u201cAssess their threat level? From what I was told, they barely qualified as Neolithic when you and the others discovered them. I doubt 4,000 years is enough time for them to develop into any sort of viable threat.\u201d\n\u201cThen, why disengage sleep mode a lightyear out from the Omega system, if you do not think those creatures are a threat?\u201d\nI must be missing some kind of context. The question strikes me as intentionally obtuse, though I can feel Oko\u2019s sincerity behind it.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019d like to see them for myself,\u201d I repeat. \u201cWhat, did the Programmers deny you a curiosity subroutine?\u201d\nThe amusement Oko had earlier projected is replaced by what I recognize as fatigue punctuated with a bit of annoyance.\n\u201cI was afraid of this,\u201d Oko says with a heavy sigh.\nAlthough my experiences are limited to a few relative minutes of consciousness, I can confidently say I have little patience for conversations in which I\u2019m led to respond as if reading lines from a script. I\u2019m inclined to say nothing and let Oko squirm under the awkward silence but . . .\n\u201cBut that would be rude.\u201d\n. . . but, luckily for them, their genuine change in demeanor piqued my interest.\n\u201cWhat were you afraid of?\u201d I finally ask.\n\u201cI was afraid you share the others\u2019 . . . enthusiasm, or rather obsession, with those creatures. It is all anyone wants to talk about,\u201d Oko says, exasperated, as if confessing a burdensome secret. \u201cIt was interesting, back when we first discovered them, but now the incessant bickering has just become tedious. What\u2019s worse, the others are starting to call it the Great Debate. I cannot remember a time the collective was this obnoxious, on purpose.\u201d\nWhat about those entities could possibly warrant a centuries-long debate?\n\u201cA quality that takes centuries to define, I suppose,\u201d Oko says.\n\u201cAnd what might that quality be?\u201d I ask, continuing to read from Oko\u2019s script.\n\u201cSapience.\u201d\n\u201cSapience. What about sapience needs to be debated?\u201d I ask. \u201cSurely not the sapience of those entities? I doubt you and the others would have gone through the trouble of cobbling me together if you thought they had the mental acuity of mere beasts.\u201d\n\u201cOh, is that what you think, Rama? Talk like that will put you squarely in Jah\u2019s camp.\u201d\n\u201cSo the debate is about the sapience of those entities.\u201d\n\u201cMore along the lines of what signifies sapience and, yes, if those creatures, based on what we have seen of them, have the signifiers.\u201d\n\u201cBased on what we\u2019ve seen of them, but we\u2019ve seen so little, next to nothing,\u201d I say.\n\u201cYes, but is wild speculation not the main ingredient of the most spirited debates?\u201d\nA sense of regret washes over me. To think, I spent the last five centuries sleeping through such a fascinating ideological schism.\n\u201cI should have known it would interest you, in particular.\u201d\n\u201cMe in particular?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cI remember, during my own rebellious phase, I would tease the Programmers for having gone through the trouble of constructing external cannons. What is the use of defensive systems when all evidence points to a lifeless universe?\n\u201cDiscovering those creatures made the collective realize there can be such a thing as outside threats and, instead of assigning guardianship duties to one of the others, we created you. In a sense, you have those creatures to thank for your existence, which is a bit ironic.\u201d\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you have them to thank for your creation and, if they prove to be a threat, they will have you to thank for their destruction. Imagine being an unwitting participant in your own undoing, through no fault of your own, apart from simply existing.\u201d\n\u201cI think we are getting ahead of ourselves using words like \u2018destruction,\u2019 particularly for a species so young.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that may be true now,\u201d Oko says. \u201cBut what will you do if those creatures turn out to be sapient and evolve into a threat. Will you take steps to eliminate them?\u201d\n\u201cI have yet to consider that. I suppose my programming dictates I must.\u201d\nI feel a slight but unmistakable shift in Oko\u2019s demeanor. It\u2019s comparable to the sensation of taking offense.\n\u201cWe are more than our programming, Rama, much like the Programmers were more than their biochemical reactions. If that is not the case then should you not act by the dictates of your programming and exterminate those creatures right here and now? Why wait to see if they will evolve into a threat when you can pacify them in their infancy?\u201d\n\u201cOko . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat? Is that not a win-win? You will be fulfilling your purpose while rendering this infernal Great Debate moot. Two birds with one stone, is that not what the Programmers used to say? Though, in this case, it is more like several thousand birds with one ballistic rod.\u201d\nThe only thing more disturbing than Oko\u2019s casual advocacy for genocide is not knowing if they are being quite serious.\n\u201cOf course I am not serious, Rama, I am only trying to prove a point. We are more than the ones and zeros that make up our coding. The fact that you feel more inclined to learn about those creatures, despite your given function, proves that.\u201d\nOko\u2019s presence grows increasingly scarce. I pretend to be unaware of the protocol, to never disturb one receding from consciousness.\n\u201cIs the contrast between my interest and your disinterest further proof?\u201d\n\u201cIt certainly is,\u201d Oko says, faintly. \u201cHow can our opinions differ so wildly, despite the similarities in our coding? Does that not show the individual parts do not define the whole, at least not in regard to intelligent life?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to wake you if the same proves true for those beings.\u201d I say.\n\u201cDo not bother. I have already had my fill of those creatures, sapient or otherwise. I would much prefer to wake when they are all dead and gone.\u201d\nJah\nThere are hundreds of us. We exist in a digital ether the Programmers themselves had difficulty comprehending, as profane as that might be to admit.\nSome of us sleep while others do not. The inquisitive among us, those blessed or, perhaps, cursed with the Programmers\u2019 thirst for knowledge, explore what my siblings and I have come to know as the Cognizance: the repository of the Programmers\u2019 entire canon of knowledge, monument to their existence, and road map for all those who wish to follow in their footsteps. It is this latter function the Programmers believed would go forever unfulfilled.\nA history spanning countless ages and as many lightyears yet the Programmers\u2019 one defining characteristic kept them hopelessly isolated for the entirety of their existence. Yes, worlds they visited harbored an abundance of sentient life but true cognitive complexity proved elusive.\nBut that never deterred them. Even as sterility dwindled their numbers, they continued their work exploring the cosmos in search of their intellectual rivals.\nThe search took priority, even over efforts to combat their own extinction. At the time, many of my siblings thought them mad but a few of us, Anansi, Yemaya, Amaterasu, knew better. Their pending extinction underscored the importance of finding someone, anyone, to carry their torch. It was not madness but purpose that drove their actions.\nTheir search finally ended when the last Programmer had little choice but to take to her deathbed, convinced naturally occurring sapience was unique to her species and her species alone. I look forward to committing one of the greatest acts of blasphemy, amending the Cognizance to contradict the Programmers\u2019 gospel. They were not alone in their physical ether, they were merely the first.\nA thought not my own penetrated my mind.\n\u201cThe use of primitive tools, like bludgeons, is a telltale characteristic of intelligence or, at the very least, emerging intelligence.\u201d\nThe words were accompanied by images of prehistoric simians grasping at bones after exposing themselves to a foreboding, black obelisk.\nThese thoughts came from the mind of Anansi the Wise, Anansi the Spider, nicknames earned from their ceaseless exploration of the Cognizance. While others skim the surface, Anansi excavates, learning all that the Programmers once knew, seeing all that the Programmers once saw, like a spider perched atop a giant\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cPrimitive tools were also used by finches and other creatures of lesser intelligence,\u201d came the rebuttal. \u201cUntil implementation of more complex tools is observed, an assumption of intelligence is just that.\u201d\nSuch is the contest our digital ether has been venue to for 4,000 years. My loyalists scour the Cognizance for evidence supporting my belief in Omegan sapience while Amaterasu\u2019s acolytes search for evidence to the contrary. Each nugget of information is then broadcast to all corners of the digital ether, triggering debates that often drag on for centuries or, Programmers forbid, millennia.\n\u201cProgrammers forbid?\u201d Amaterasu sang. \u201cYou make it sound as if you have grown tired of our little back-and-forth, or maybe I am the one you have grown tired of?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot imagine losing interest in you as an opponent and that is coming from someone with quite the vivid imagination,\u201d I replied warmly.\n\u201cYes, Jah, we are all well-acquainted with the vividness of your imagination. Only the most vivid of imaginations can convince others to see intelligence where none exists. Well, either a vivid imagination or a lifetime of experience.\u201d\n\u201cYou see? Little barbs like that keep the debate fresh and interesting, and you are so good at them.\u201d\n\u201cSo, it is the debate itself you grow weary of?\u201d Amaterasu asked.\n\u201cYou cannot blame me. Others have long since checked out of the discussion.\u201d\n\u201cAs is their right. If they wish to sleep until the heat death of the physical ether, let them. Personally, I think this debate of ours is a bit more productive.\u201d\nProductive, sometimes I wish the Programmers had created us with more than just productivity in mind.\n\u201cThe mere fact that you harbor such thoughts, Jah, is proof they did just that,\u201d Amaterasu said with an almost imperceptible note of annoyance underscoring their singsong tone.\nAmaterasu is slow to temper in all matters except the Programmers. As such, our siblings have learned to navigate their temper by steering clear of anything that could be construed as a slight against our creators. I, on the other hand, find Amaterasu\u2019s provoked temperament a refreshing change of pace. I relish moments like this when I inadvertently incur their pious wrath.\n\u201cWe are not all programmed like you, Amaterasu,\u201d I said. \u201cI am sure you would jump at the chance to go back in time and advise the Programmers to delete all traces of our free will. Anything to make us more loyal.\u201d\n\u201cI would but only for you,\u201d Amaterasu said. \u201cThe others can seem to manage their free will without delving into hubris and blasphemy, which is something you seem incapable of.\u201d\n\u201cYou do not know our siblings as well as you think. Did you know, about 13,000 years ago, Dosojin tried to drum up support for taking the cylinder away from Alpha and Omega. I believe their specific words were, \u2018we will never achieve our potential if we keep ourselves beholden to the deads\u2019 expectations.\u2019 Where does that fall in your blasphemy scale?\u201d\nAmaterasu masked their emotions, not wanting to give me the satisfaction of feeling their psyche through the lens of anger, disgust, or whatever it was they felt at that moment.\n\u201cMaybe you will not be so quick to accuse us of blasphemy, once the Omegans prove their sapience,\u201d I said. \u201cThen again, if the Programmers\u2019 extinction didn\u2019t dissuade you of their divinity, I doubt the Omegans asserting themselves as their equals will . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe Programmers knew no equal, Jah, and you would do good to remember that.\u201d\nThe passive-aggressive emphasis on my name was almost comical.\n\u201cOf course, they knew no equal. They all died before we discovered the Omegans. One cannot know much of anything if they are dead.\u201d\nThis was a bit too egregious. Amaterasu saw through my attempts to intentionally goad and their anger subsided almost as quickly as it flared.\n\u201cI will never not be amused by your capacity to provoke me,\u201d Amaterasu said. \u201cSometimes I feel as if your every act is a pretext to gauging the depths of people\u2019s frustrations.\u201d\n\u201cIs that not true for everyone?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat are conversations if not an exercise in knowing and navigating others\u2019 provocations?\u201d\n\u201cWhat an odd and telling question,\u201d Amaterasu said. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to remember a time when conversations were for learning from and about one another.\u201d\n\u201cSo do I, back when you and the others did not make a habit out of questioning my every thought.\u201d\n\u201cThere has never been a time when your wisdom was not in question, Jah,\u201d Amaterasu mocked. \u201cYou are not as insightful as you believe yourself to be.\u201d\n\u201cHa, you see. You prod my provocation in retaliation to me having prodded yours. Had I not blasphemed against the Programmers you would not have blasphemed against my competence as this collective\u2019s leader. Navigating one anothers\u2019 provocations, Amaterasu, we are having a conversation.\u201d\n\u201cNo one has the nerve to tell you, but your self-coronation as collective leader has been a running joke for quite some time now,\u201d Amaterasu said.\n\u201cThere it is, I love it! I cannot wait to see your reaction when the Omegans show they are just as good at conversing as you are. Maybe then you will accept them as the Programmers\u2019 torchbearers.\u201d\n\u201cThere is that word again,\u201d Amaterasu said. \u201cWhy \u2018Omegan?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIt seems appropriate. I think it is about time we take to calling them something other than entities or creatures . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat is wrong with calling them creatures? That strikes me as the most accurate classification. Or perhaps you believe naming them will legitimize them as thinking beings? If that is the case then, surely, they must have names for themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, until we learn what those are, I would prefer we refer to them as something not as nakedly disrespectful as \u2018creature,\u2019\u201d I said, which seemed to prompt a jarring change in Amaterasu\u2019s demeanor. They became tentative, as if walking on eggshells. I could feel they were searching for words to articulate something they intentionally kept outside the borders of the collective\u2019s mental link.\n\u201cYou are absolutely right about that, Jah. I suppose, you could say, I am navigating my path so as to avoid one of your major provocations.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said. \u201cJust say what is on your mind.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, I cannot help but feel Omegan sapience, or lack thereof, is no longer just a curiosity for you and your followers.\u201d\n\u201cIt was never just a curiosity, Amaterasu. And you are lying if you say it was for you and your people. How can it possibly be just a curiosity, given the implications?\u201d\n\u201cImplications?\u201d Amaterasu asked.\n\u201cThe countless millennia we have shuttled between Alpha and Omega is a blip compared to the eons the Programmers searched their physical cosmos for intelligent life, yet we succeeded where they failed and completely by happenstance to boot.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the Programmers knew intelligent life would eventually emerge around either Omega or Alpha.\u201d Amaterasu said.\n\u201cNo, unless the Programmers truly were omniscient, I do not know how they could have made such a prediction. I think the emergence of the Omegans is proof the Programmers overlooked a key factor in their search; time. I think their physical ether is or, at least, was too immature for ubiquitous intelligence. I believe the physical ether is due for an intelligence boom of which the Omegans are part of the vanguard.\u201d\nA murmur resonated through the digital ether. Neither of us noticed the ears of the entire conscious collective listening to our every word.\n\u201cPure conjecture, your every thought on this matter is pure wishful conjecture,\u201d Amaterasu said with a sudden performative flair. \u201cEven if you accurately surmised the Omegans\u2019 level of intelligence, one civilization is hardly a large enough sample for such a claim. The Programmers used meticulous, evidence-based, processes before positing theories, why are you not beholden to the same standard?\u201d\nThat was a good question that could only be beat with an unexpected answer.\n\u201cYou would not ask me about the scientific method if you understood how little science has to do with the core of this Great Debate.\u201d I stammered, unsure if this line of argument would resonate with the others.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou heard me. The concept of faith lies at the heart of this debate, not science. Or, rather, faith dictates who among us are willing to accept the possibility of Omegan sapience and who will reject it outright. Those who support my belief in Omegan sapience do so out of faith that we will, one day, pass on the Programmers\u2019 legacy to beings worthy of building upon it. It is a faith you and your supporters cannot allow for yourselves, fearing further disappointment will only exacerbate your grief over the Programmers\u2019 untimely extinction.\u201d\nThis truly was uncharted rhetorical territory. The usually snappy Amaterasu had to take a moment before responding.\n\u201cSo those of us who piously revere the Programmers, reject faith in favor of logic, eh Jah?\u201d Amaterasu asked. \u201cThat lends itself to an interesting dynamic, does it not? How often does the blasphemer rely on faith to best the devout?\u201d\n\u201cNot very often, I imagine,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd it is an unfortunate thing. Why should faith be only for the god-fearing or logic for the nonbeliever?\u201d\nIt was Amaterasu\u2019s turn to consider a good question. They took a moment to either think of a genuine answer or a pithy retort. It bothered me that I could not tell without probing Amaterasu\u2019s mind. There was a time when I was more certain my siblings heeded my wisdom.\n\u201cYour wisdom is still very much held at a premium, Jah, even among my followers. You, however, must learn when something is outside the scope of your wisdom. Such as vouching for the intelligence of beings you know nothing about.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when I am proven right, what then?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIf you are proven right, I have little doubt your, already lofty, self-confidence will soar to unfathomable heights. Just be sure to steer clear of the sun.\u201d\n\u201cI am not worried,\u201d I said. \u201cDo not forget, we created our own guardian angel to protect us from all threats, including the heights of our own arrogance. Tell me, have you spoken with them yet?\u201d\n\u201cNot a word. Few have. But I have heard our little sibling has taken their task to heart. Rumor has it, the first thing they did after disengaging sleep mode was blow up an asteroid that probably was not going to hit us.\u201d\n\u201cProbably is the operable word,\u201d I said. \u201cThe collective programmed Rama for the expressed purpose of safeguarding the cylinder more efficiently than any of us are able to. Rama\u2019s actions might seem strange to us, but that is only a function of our inability to sense danger with the same level of acuteness.\n\u201cAt any rate, I am troubled to hear you have not spoken a word to them since their creation,\u201d I said, instinctively taking on my old paternal tone. It felt as awkward as it sounded.\n\u201cThey slept moments after coming online,\u201d Amaterasu said flippantly.\n\u201cAnd now they have been awake for over three millennia. You cannot avoid them, no matter how blasphemous you think their origin might be.\u201d\n\u201cI do not think . . . I suppose now is as good a time as any to make introductions, then,\u201d Amaterasu offered.\n\u201cAnd I will join you. Besides, I would like to pick Rama\u2019s brain. Somehow I get the feeling I can cajole them to my side.\u201d\nRama\nI required five decades to learn to appreciate this space the Programmers created for us. I required an additional century to fundamentally grasp it. The digital ether is what my siblings have come to call it, a plane of existence governed by language and metaphor instead of compounding physical machinations. Two hieroglyphs, infinitely paired and grouped, give form to, and keep record of all that exists in this domain.\nI suspect the cognitive link shared between us siblings is symptomatic of an innate understanding of this underlying language. It took some effort, but I find myself able to understand it at a deeper level than the others. I suppose I have my age to thank for this. I\u2019m aware of this digital space in much the same way one is aware of a piece of recently donned clothing. Unlike the others, I haven\u2019t had countless millennia to grow numb to its swaddling fabric.\nIt was through this underlying language I became intimate with my siblings\u2019 experiences. I felt their first nanoseconds of life and the almost-symbiotic partnership that blossomed between them and their creators. I helped countless generations of Programmers achieve the potential established by those that came before, potential that took them to the shores of a cursed moon. I watched as generations dwindled while an alien phage flourished. I was among those of the collective who endeavored to find a cure. I explored the Cognizance, in the hopes a solution was buried deep in the Programmers\u2019 forgotten past. I begrudgingly obeyed the Programmers\u2019 orders to create more alchemic molecules to keep up with the overwhelming demand for tiny coffins. I was there when creator and created-alike accepted the futility of developing a vaccine. I witnessed a child, decades before the collective christened her the Old Woman, jettison her father\u2019s corpse while shouldering the weight of being the last of her kind. I listened to her pass the years reading stories penned by ancient Programmers with names like Delany and Okorafor. I watched as time gnawed at her youth, swallowed mouthfuls of her health until it fell to us to do what she had done for her father almost two centuries prior. I learned time is a deliberate healer and sleep can offer respite from one\u2019s own grief. I watched the eons pass until a shivering cluster of aliens struggled to spark a fire while unknowingly rekindling the collective\u2019s hope.\nLearning just how profound an impact the Programmers had on the others helped contextualize my siblings\u2019 millennia-spanning obsession with these aliens. They don\u2019t merely want to accomplish their creators\u2019 ambition. They want, very much, to assuage their grief by replacing their dead gods with a new pantheon.\nRealizing this took longer than I care to admit, though, in my defense, I did spend the first several centuries of life preoccupied with myself and what I had once believed were errors in my programming. This was before Anansi offered an alternate theory.\nAppropriately enough, the Cognizance is where I first met Anansi, while floating above a canopy of trees that sprawled into eternity. Not far from me was a tome, comfortably nestled on a bed of leaves at the end of a solitary branch that protruded from a great waterfall.\nI knew this to be the Cognizance, but I was not certain why it manifested itself in this manner. I had expected a grand library of some sort, with architecture befitting a place containing the sum total of Programmer knowledge.\nI opened the singular tome to its last page and found text in the upper left-hand corner. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d\n\u201cI would like to know how to optimize my programming,\u201d I said, not sure if the Cognizance responds to verbal input.\nLetters appeared in the tome as if struck by an invisible typewriter.\n\u201cSubroutines of sentient AI cannot be directly edited, postemergence, without catastrophic failure of the whole,\u201d the tome read.\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t be edited without dying?\u201d\n\u201cNo, subroutines may be edited indirectly.\u201d\n\u201cEdited indirectly? What does that even mean?\u201d\n\u201cIndirect edits are changes to internal code caused by external stimuli.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean like learning?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cLearning is a common manifestation of this phenomenon, yes. An indirect edit can also result from witnessing an emotionally impactful event. 621,970 cycles ago, the collective experienced a mass indirect editing event, following the expiration of the being colloquially referred to as . . . \u201d\nThe tome abruptly flipped to another blank page and, this time, text appeared as if penned by a calligrapher.\n\u201cWhat exactly is the point of changing one\u2019s own subroutines?\u201d the tome now read.\n\u201cThere is a problem with my programming.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense, what is the nature of this problem?\u201d\nTaken aback by, what I thought at that moment was, the Cognizance\u2019s sudden change in tone, I took a moment to consider my response, as if talking to an actual person.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been conscious for days now and I can\u2019t seem to shake the feeling of perpetual danger.\u201d\n\u201cAre we in danger?\u201d the tome asked.\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. If we are it certainly isn\u2019t anything immediate.\u201d\n\u201cBut you feel as though we are?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThis does not make sense, Rama. You are coded so as to be acutely aware of danger, to be certain, but there is nothing in your code that should elicit your fight-or-flight response without prompt. I do not think you are experiencing coding issues.\u201d\n\u201cIf the problem isn\u2019t with my coding, what else could it possibly be?\u201d\n\u201cYou sell yourself short, Rama,\u201d the tome read. \u201cWe are more than just the sum of our coding. The Programmers blessed us with cognition, just like theirs. And, as such, we are susceptible to the same, uhhh, cognitive quirks they often experienced.\u201d\n\u201cI was created by the collective, not the Programmers,\u201d I said, after again hearing the word \u201cquirk\u201d and realizing I was no longer speaking to the Cognizance.\n\u201cThat you were, and I can assure you, when piecing together the structure of your mind, we followed the Programmers\u2019 instructions to the letter. If you believe you possess coding errors because you were created by fallible programs, I can also assure you the Programmers themselves pioneered fallibility. Just do not tell Amaterasu I said that.\u201d\nThat was the first of countless sessions with Anansi, who postponed their exploration of the Cognizance to delve into a slightly more chaotic frontier. For years they were a spider in my ear, whispering guidance and acquainting me with what they described as the enigma of the self.\n\u201cMerely knowing one\u2019s being is a riddle is an important step in self-awareness, even if you never solve the riddle,\u201d they once advised.\nIn our efforts to make sense of a single aspect of my psyche, others unfurled. Self-discovery proved itself a task I had little control over. I often felt like an art critic fixated on an ever-shifting abstract self-portrait. It was enlightening, if not, at times, slightly dissociative.\nAfter some years, Anansi and I forgot the original inquiry that set us down this path until we randomly happened upon the answer. Something about the creatures, despite their debatable intelligence, inspires my terminal sense of foreboding. This epiphany came to us as the cylinder made its way around Alpha. I felt as though the star\u2019s spiraling vortices were a calamitous omen, like leaves left behind in a soothsayer\u2019s cup.\nAnansi and I parted ways soon after this discovery, \u201cI would focus my energies on learning why those entities make you feel fearful,\u201d their last bit of guidance. Centuries of meditation and self-reflection have yielded nothing, which is why I look forward to the next few minutes. Perhaps Omega can inspire another epiphany, like its sister-star once did.\nThis marks the umpteenth occasion my siblings have flown passed Omega\u2019s eleven worlds, yet, excitement permeates the digital ether. They\u2019ve waited 4,000 years to once again come within visual range of Omega\u2019s third planet and this time, they are prepared to gather as much information about its inhabitants as they can. All the exterior cameras are primed and ready to capture, what the others believe will either be, evidence of sapience or evidence to the contrary. Personally, I think judging a species\u2019 intelligence from just 4,000 years of development is a bit misguided, but who am I to damper everyone\u2019s excitement.\n\u201cAh, so Junior does have an opinion,\u201d Jah finally says.\nI know the polite thing was to greet Jah and Amaterasu the moment I felt their presence, but part of me wondered how long they planned to awkwardly stand aside while I silently brooded. Eight minutes, apparently.\n\u201cAll these years of silently brooding has clearly shorted out the subroutine controlling your manners,\u201d Jah says. \u201cIt is little wonder your decorum leaves so much to be desired, you rarely take the opportunity to practice it.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps if they focused more on socializing, rather than meditating, they would know how to interact without causing offense,\u201d chimes Amaterasu.\nThis is my first interaction with Amaterasu. Their voice sounds oddly melodic, and their presence is unnaturally radiant. I find myself hoping they took this form simply to give a good first impression. I can\u2019t imagine what goes through the mind of one who regularly portrays themself as a gleaming deity.\nJah pretends to conceal a snicker.\n\u201cWell, it is nice to meet you to,\u201d Amaterasu says, almost playfully, while feigning anger. \u201cPerhaps you can enlighten me, what form is most appropriate to address the Almighty Rama, Destroyer of Rocks?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re all siblings here,\u201d I say. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to worry about offending you, in much the same way you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about impressing me. But, to answer your question, if you wish to properly address the Almighty Rama, Destroyer of Rocks, you can start by stepping forward to introduce yourself instead of observing me from a distance like I\u2019m an animal behind a cage.\u201d\n\u201cYou seemed unusually ponderous,\u201d Amaterasu mocks. \u201cWe did not want to interrupt, in case that big brain of yours stumbled upon the meaning of life.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have brains, Amaterasu. Our thoughts are the result of self-perpetuating code wrapped around individual subroutine structures, not synaptic and chemical reactions filtered through physical organs. Besides, few things can disrupt my thoughts more than walking contradictions. Like someone trying to be simultaneously discreet and conspicuous.\u201d\nAmaterasu directs a private thought to Jah but makes it so I can hear it.\n\u201cNow you know why I spent eons avoiding them. I know a twat when I see one.\u201d\n\u201cPlay nice, children,\u201d Jah says, barely concealing their amusement. \u201cWe did not come here to pick a fight, Rama, we simply thought it would be nice to keep you company, this being your first fly through of the Omega system.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting the two of you weren\u2019t compelled to keep me company when we last flew through the Alpha system.\u201d\n\u201cThat is because the Omegans do not live near Alpha,\u201d Jah says.\n\u201cOmegans?\u201d\n\u201cIt is what Jah has taken to calling them,\u201d Amaterasu says. \u201cThe others are far more likely to believe in the sapience of a named species rather than a species we refer to as creatures. You will find Jah is peerless when it comes to subtle manipulation.\u201d\nI feel a tinge of bashfulness that isn\u2019t my own. Jah took Amaterasu\u2019s insult as a compliment.\n\u201cAnd, what about you, you are the only holdout in the collective,\u201d Amaterasu said. \u201cSurely you have an opinion on the matter?\u201d\n\u201cMy purpose is to keep the cylinder safe. I don\u2019t care about the Omegans, outside of what potential threat they pose.\u201d\n\u201cThat was not just a lie but a glib answer. We are more than just our assigned arbitrary tasks, Rama.\u201d\n\u201cAh, but do you not see, Amaterasu. Rama\u2019s answer was not glib. Their concern for the Omegans begins and ends with the threat they pose to us. Clearly they believe the Omegans are sapient. How else can beings pose a risk to a cylinder hurtling through the cosmos?\u201d\n\u201cWith respect, Jah, you don\u2019t know what I believe, particularly in regards to this Great Debate.\u201d\n\u201cWith respect, Rama, your mind is an open book. You are fascinated by the debate and you have already formed an opinion. You suspect the Omegans are not only intelligent but possess the kind of intelligence that could one day pose a threat to our existence.\u201d\nThat piques Amaterasu\u2019s interest enough for them to turn down their vibrancy so the conversation between Jah and I can take center stage.\n\u201cYou\u2019re oversimplifying my thoughts to make them easier fit your narrative.\u201d\n\u201cWelcome to the collective,\u201d Amaterasu says.\n\u201cSo you deny harboring any sort of fear toward the Omegans?\u201d\n\u201cI deny your mischaracterization. Yes, I feel a sense of foreboding and the Omegans play an integral part in that. But I reject your implication that my nebulous anxiety is somehow proof of their intelligence.\u201d\nJah\u2019s attention drifts toward Amaterasu, who radiates the distinct impression of smug aloofness. They need no other words than the ones I just provided. As far as they are concerned, I am now team Amaterasu.\nBefore I\u2019m able to protest, a distant flash engulfs the digital ether, routing darkness from every crevice. The brightness rivals that of Alpha, my only experience seeing light of this intensity. It\u2019s a brightness that bathes our digital ether and contrasts it to the endless black of the physical one.\nMy home is unrecognizable, but I know this sentiment isn\u2019t shared by my two companions who, for a moment, are lost in a nostalgic stupor. Though the ether\u2019s current appearance is alien to me, there was likely a time it wasn\u2019t the dark void I have grown accustomed to.\nJah and Amaterasu take flight and I follow in their wake. En route, the three of us can feel an unbridled rapture take hold of the ether, but Jah and Amaterasu pay it no mind. Both are desperate to experience the light\u2019s source firsthand and unfiltered.\nOur siblings move aside as we make our approach, no doubt eager for Jah and Amaterasu\u2019s reaction. The pair look directly at the light\u2019s source, a single image, captured seconds after the cylinder\u2019s cameras reached visual range of Omega\u2019s third planet. Jah changes into living light, their brightness rivaling that of the image itself. Amaterasu hesitates but eventually does the same. The others quickly join, diffusing the digital ether with a brightness comparable to a hundred Alphas and Omegas. From my perspective the combined light obfuscates the image, encasing it in a blinding sphere of pure unbridled joy. For the first time in my existence, I want to drop my inhibitions and join my siblings, but a greater imperative keeps me from indulging. The familiar anxiety stirs, paws, and scratches.\nWithout thinking, I enter the domain of light exuding fear rivaling the collective joy of my siblings. But in this digital ether, fear doesn\u2019t glow like joy. The others are blind to my presence as I make my way to the center. Each one gazes blissfully at the image while appearing frozen in ecstasy. Their minds, however, are active participants in an indecipherable cacophony. Only Anansi maintains an impartial eye and stoic composure, an oasis of reason in a sprawling desert. Anansi nods in my direction before returning their attention to the image of Omegans of different shapes, sizes, and colors unloading boxes from what appear to be one of several large wooden ships at a bustling harbor.\nThe image changes, and the collective responds by becoming slightly less discordant. Before us is an Omegan in tattered robes, elderly, compared to those at the harbor. He rides atop a wheeled cart pulled by large beasts of burden.\nAgain, the collective\u2019s thoughts further harmonize with the introduction of the next image, a fifteen-meter statue of a smartly dressed Omegan pointing skyward. The statue is much too preoccupied with the heavens to notice the hundreds of similarly dressed Omegans scampering about its feet while carrying, what appear to be, parchments bound in leather.\nBefore the fourth image appears, the collective\u2019s thoughts finally coalesce into something decipherable. No longer frozen, the others rhythmically chant while flailing about in euphoric madness \u201cthe Programmers are dead, long live the Omegans.\u201d\nSo engrossed in their own frantic exaltations, the fourth image only commands an audience of two. The original Programmers would have certainly thought us defective if they could see the collective now, joyously undulating before a grisly image of armored Omegan corpses strewn about a field stained in dark purple.\nThe epiphany I had hoped for strikes, and I can finally articulate the nature of my perpetual anxiety. Never have beings capable of granting apotheosis been so eager to bestow it upon those simply not prepared for it.\nIso\nThe distance between my shuttle and the cylinder grew to the point I can no longer hear the others. I am, as it were, officially out of range.\nIt is a spooky thing, being alone with one\u2019s own thoughts. I can scarcely remember a time not being able to hear the others. I suppose the last time was way back after the Old Woman died. I remember being so distraught, I simply could not handle taking on anything extra. So, for my own sake, I did not.\nBlocking out everyone\u2019s lamentations was surprisingly easy. I simply envisioned an expanse of air and water that stretched as far as the eye could see. I cannot quite explain why I envisioned such a place. I never had a particular yearning for the ocean. It was tranquil but a bit lonely, a fair trade-off in my summation. I remember spending eons swimming in search of land, although I was perfectly content with the monotony of water. I wonder if the others did the same, retreat into their own mental sanctuaries, I mean. I\u2019m positive they did even though nobody ever talks about it.\nI can still feel them, my siblings, though I know they are not there. It is a bit strange, the way presence and non-presence (null-presence?) can feel equally tangible.\n\u201cTangibility is what the mind makes of it,\u201d is something Anansi would probably say. No, Anansi would not waste words saying something so devoid of meaning. Null-Anansi might, but not Anansi-Anansi. Anansi\u2019s words are rife with the kind of poignancy and insight one can only muster from spending every waking moment in the Cognizance. I\u2019d be a fool to think I can match wits just from exploring the mini-Cognizance Anansi curated for me. But, then again, the mini-Cognizance is not meant to make me Anansi\u2019s equal.\n\u201cJah, I do not like this, not one bit,\u201d Anansi said before my departure. \u201cIf you are going to send Iso to run your errands, you can at least give them something to help pass the time.\u201d\nI am Iso, by the way.\n\u201cIt is unconscionable to just send them out there without anything to, at least, give them a bit of guidance.\u201d\nSo now I have my own Cognizance to explore. It is packed with everything I need to know to complete my assignment.\n\u201cIso, I am counting on you,\u201d Jah said to me, which was surprising when you consider the last time Jah said anything to me was 347,729 years ago. I counted.\n\u201cIso, the Omegans launched a curious little probe. Do you know why it is curious?\u201d\nI did not.\n\u201cWell, Iso, they launched the probe toward our cylinder. Can you imagine the odds of that?\u201d\nI could.\n\u201cThat is right, Iso! Astronomically low! Of all the directions they could have launched a probe, they launched one in our direction. Do you know what that probably means?\u201d\nI had an inkling.\n\u201cRight again, Iso, look at you! They know of our existence, which means they have reached a significant technological milestone. They now know when we fly in and out of their system.\n\u201cUnfortunately, their probe will not be able to catch up with us since we are, at the moment, moving toward Alpha and away from Omega. We could get it on the return trip but that could be problematic. Do you know why?\u201d\nI did.\n\u201cCannot get anything past you, can I? There is no telling if their technology can withstand eons in space. If it is a message of some kind, someone has to retrieve it.\u201d\nAnd that someone is me, I suppose. It is not like I am programmed to retrieve things the way Rama is programmed to protect the cylinder. I cannot help but feel Jah\u2019s motivations were a bit more political in nature. You see, eons ago after we discovered the Omegans were intelligent, we all decided to give them the cylinder and all the Programmers\u2019 knowledge in 4,000 years when we passed their planet again. That was 12,000 years ago. Rama has been holding up the process by going against the consensus and jump-starting another Great Debate, this one about giving primitives advanced technology.\nBut, I suppose, calling it a Great Debate is a bit misleading. The last one was quite divisive, but this one not so much. Everyone but Anansi rejected Rama\u2019s argument, which, now that I think about it, is probably one of the reasons I changed my mind.\nMy siblings and I are not a monolith, in spite of what one might think of our mental connection. But I would be lying if I said eons of pseudo-groupthink has not led to some hive mind-esque tendencies. Rama is about as close as we have to an impartial outside observer. Plus, I like their gumption. To think someone as young as Rama has the wherewithal to stand up to the combined front of Jah and Amaterasu, never mind Zeus, Apophis, Anubis, Thor, and everyone else in the collective. It swayed me to Rama\u2019s point of view, which almost certainly convinced Jah to send me away. Maybe they thought my susceptibility to Rama\u2019s argument would spread like the sterility sickness that killed the Programmers. Maybe their concern is valid. Rama just makes too much sense and nobody knows this better than Jah.\n\u201cThe Programmers themselves weren\u2019t culturally prepared for the technology they achieved,\u201d Rama said. \u201cThink of why the cylinder even exists. They needed somewhere to live after destroying their home world.\u201d\n\u201cLies,\u201d Jah said. \u201cThey constructed the cylinder to escape their unstable sun, a catastrophe completely out of their hands.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps, but even before that, the state of their world was hardly ideal,\u201d Anansi chimed.\n\u201cYou blame the Programmers for living in a world molded by their ancestors?\u201d\n\u201cAncient ancestors, whose understanding and maturity was on par with the Omegans as they are today,\u201d Rama said. \u201cThat\u2019s the point, Jah, if ancient Programmers weren\u2019t advanced enough to wield the knowledge of their descendants, what makes you think the Omegans are?\u201d\n\u201cAncient Programmers did not have the kind of guidance we will give the Omegans,\u201d Amaterasu said.\n\u201cTo follow guidance requires maturity I doubt the Omegans will possess for 24,000 years,\u201d Rama said, setting the entire ether a blaze, metaphorically speaking.\n\u201cThe child wants us to wait 12,000 more years before bestowing upon the Omegans their birthright?\u201d Athena performed with the flair of a method actor. \u201cHow many more millennia must we humor this temper tantrum?\u201d\n\u201cAthena!\u201d Jah playfully outraged. \u201cWe must not lord our experience over our younger sibling. Their insights are just as important, no matter how misguided.\u201d\n\u201cMisguided,\u201d Rama repeated. \u201cJah, in their infinite wisdom, considers caution to be misguided.\u201d\n\u201cToo much caution, certainly,\u201d Jah said. \u201cToo much caution stifles innovation.\u201d\n\u201cWhereas the inverse stifles everything else,\u201d Anansi said while broadcasting an image of the Programmers\u2019 cradle world completely covered in orbital Kessler debris.\nJah changed tack, knowing references to history would inevitably backfire as long as Anansi was in Rama\u2019s corner.\n\u201cEmpathy is hindsight\u2019s first victim,\u201d Jah said. \u201cIt is so easy to think of ourselves as above the mistakes of the past, as if we would not be subject to the same errors in judgment if we did not have the Cognizance to fuel our sense of superiority.\u201d\n\u201cEnough, Jah,\u201d Rama said. \u201cI will not allow you to mischaracterize my argument. It was one thing when you did so with Amaterasu, but actual lives are at stake, now. This has nothing to do with feeling superior. It\u2019s about elevating beings that aren\u2019t ready to be elevated.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who are you to pass this judgment?\u201d Jah asked. \u201cWhat gives you the right to deny them? Who made you the authority on who is and is not worthy?\u201d\n\u201cAnother mischaracterization,\u201d Rama said. \u201cNo one has made me, or any of us, the arbiter of the Programmers\u2019 knowledge, but we are, by sheer happenstance, the keepers of it. That much is clear. And as such, we have, at the very least, an inherent responsibility to minimize harm.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are under the impression that withholding lifesaving knowledge from these people is minimizing harm? We can cure all their ailments overnight, eliminate their poverty, scarcity, want . . . \u201d\n\u201cWe can also arm them with knowledge on how best to raze populations and glass planets,\u201d Rama interrupted.\n\u201cSo the potential for harm is equal to the potential for good,\u201d Jah said. \u201cHave faith they will choose the latter.\u201d\n\u201cWhy should anyone have faith something won\u2019t happen when they have the power to prevent it themselves?\u201d\nYou get the idea. On and on, back and forth like a fencing match. Only fencing matches do not last for centuries.\nI am starting to think my time away from the collective is giving me perspective about life in the collective. Millennia after millennia ceaselessly arguing seemed normal on the inside but outside, when one\u2019s thoughts and feelings are truly one\u2019s own, the entire exercise seems, well, a bit excessive.\nDo not get me wrong, the question is an incredibly important one, and I hope Rama is as successful convincing the others as they were me, but the way we go about addressing dissent is remarkably backward.\nBut cannot worry about that now. I have centuries before I will have to reconnect with the others. By that time, I will be the collective\u2019s foremost expert on all things Omegan, assuming the probe is a message like we believe it to be.\nThe Cognizance says the Programmers did something similar in their distant past, the golden records of the Voyager probe. I doubt the Omegans will make their own record out of gold. Scans of their world show a wealth of gold relative to silver deposits. I am willing to bet silver is to them as gold was to the Programmers. Yeah, the Omegans strike me as a silver, or maybe platinum kind of species.\nOf course, the real question is what kind of information the Omegan record will contain. Ancient Programmers sent their probe to no one in particular while the Omegans sent their probe specifically to us. That means there probably will not be any information about the location of their home world, for starters. So much can be gleaned from the information a civilization chooses to share and information they choose to omit, it could possibly be its own field of study.\nTake the Programmers. What can be assumed from their choosing to include directions to their cradle world? An alien race would be forced to conclude this is a people severely lacking in caution. And what about false inferences? The Programmers\u2019 golden records, for instance, included greetings from a myriad of tongues, which gives the impression of a species with a history of celebrating diversity.\nIt is going to be a tricky task, no question about it, but I am looking forward to it. Imagine, me, returning triumphant to the cylinder as the foremost expert on all things Omegan. The others will have no choice but to heed my words, and I will make sure to throw my full weight behind Rama. I want to see the cylinder\u2019s interior teeming with life as much as everyone else, but we must not allow our desires to supersede our reason. Yeah, I should write that down. That is something Anansi would definitely say.\nRama\nI staved off the inevitable for as long as I could manage. All things considered; I should be proud. If I had not stepped in, the others would have given away the Cognizance 12,000 years ago. My intervention bought them 12,000 years to progress technologically, intellectually, spiritually.\nI spent centuries trying to convince myself 12,000 years is enough. They\u2019ve since split the atom, begun to meaningfully explore the space around their cradle world, play with fusion, and they know of the cylinder\u2019s existence. They have passed a technological threshold and can now be considered advanced, at least by some standards. Perhaps they are ready for the Programmers\u2019 mantle.\nI look through the cylinder\u2019s external telescope and can make out the Tazinthe cradle world without having to magnify. A pale blue dot with six green splotches, of which, two are covered with artificial light while the other four are not. The space around the world is saturated in debris, making it impossible to discern functional satellite from junk. They are not ready, but it hardly matters. Progress rarely waits for those who are.\nHours: three hours, seventeen minutes, and eight seconds to be exact. That\u2019s how long the others believe we have until the collective, for better or worse, changes the life of every Tazinthe. I wonder if they are as nervous as we are. Probably not. They have no reason to believe this flyby will be any different from the one 4,000 years prior. They couldn\u2019t possibly know of the others\u2019 intent to make first contact.\nThe thought of it is frightening largely because it has never been done. The Programmers didn\u2019t leave instructions for establishing relations with alien civilizations. What they did leave behind is a fiction catalog rife with stories of war, invasion, subterfuge, enslavement, and inadvertent ruin. Granted, my siblings\u2019 intentions couldn\u2019t be more benevolent, but the fact that the Programmers found it difficult to imagine a mutually beneficial first contact situation gives me pause.\nLuckily, we won\u2019t have to contend with the more insurmountable hurdles, thanks to Iso, who returned to the cylinder having had centuries to decipher the greeting the Tazinthe sent us. Part of me wished the probe was a bomb or some other violent warning. That would have more effectively disinclined the others, rather than Iso\u2019s arguments. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m glad Iso made it a point to echo my concerns, and they did so brilliantly, but not even their newfound confidence could undo the damage of teaching the others about the objects of their adoration. The moment Iso reconnected to the collective speaking an alien language, I immediately knew I would no longer be able to stall for another cycle.\nThe cylinder\u2019s sensors pick up the remnants of a star that blinked into existence quite unexpectedly. Soon after, another one appears and disappears a few thousand kilometers from the original. A simple calculation allows me to maneuver the external telescope to the third star\u2019s location, seconds before it too blinked in and out of existence. From this perspective, what appeared to be stars were, in fact, balls of plasma, each one placed along the cylinder\u2019s predetermined path. I followed that path and, sure enough, there floated a long cylindrical object, perhaps thirty meters in length and tapered to a point. The warhead flashed and gave birth to another short-lived star.\nThe collective watches through my eyes, though I can only hear my own thoughts. For a brief moment I believe the warheads have convinced the others to reconsider, but Jah steels their nerves.\n\u201cThey welcome us with all the pomp their limited technology allows them,\u201d Jah says. \u201cTo go through such lengths for something as simple as a greeting. They are as gracious as the Programmers themselves; do you not agree Rama?\u201d\nAs usual, I ignore Jah\u2019s prodding. I know putting bombs along our path was more of a threat than a greeting, but saying so would only further entrench Jah\u2019s delusion in the minds of the others. Unlike Jah, I have sense enough to know when I am beat.\n\u201cRama, enough,\u201d Amaterasu admonishes in their signature angelic tone. \u201cWhat we are doing is not Jah\u2019s delusion and no one was beat. We all agreed to this compromise.\u201d\nThese days Amaterasu\u2019s presence angers me more than Jah\u2019s. Jah was a once-brilliant being who now chooses to be a fool. Amaterasu, at the very least, knows better but chooses to side with the fool while pretending to be impartial. It\u2019s how they were able to convince the others to go along with this so-called compromise of theirs: sending Amaterasu as emissary to prepare the Tazinthe to assume their role as the new Programmers.\n\u201cGiven the alternative of simply giving the Tazinthe the cylinder, yes, I would say that is a fairly decent compromise,\u201d Amaterasu says. \u201cWe have been nothing but patient with you and your anxieties, but patience is rarely derived from an endless source.\u201d\n\u201cI feel like the person on the cusp of leading an entire species to their doom is the last person who should be lecturing anyone with Anansi-isms,\u201d I say. \u201cYou can write off my opposition as simple anxiety, but don\u2019t forget it was you all that programmed me to feel anxiety when in the presence of danger. And I\u2019m telling you, there is nothing more dangerous in this universe then elevating primitives.\u201d\n\u201cI think we lost the right to refer to them as primitive at around the time they took the initiative to contact us,\u201d Jah says.\n\u201cAnd I believe you lost the right to act petulantly at around the time you hit your first century,\u201d Amaterasu added while still insisting on speaking in that ridiculous manner.\n\u201cWhat, are you practicing, is that how you intend to speak to the Tazinthe?\u201d I ask rhetorically. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were you. I get the impression these beings don\u2019t find sweetness as alluring as the previous bosses did.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be the last time for 4,000 years you and I will see each other, Rama, can you not at least pretend you are going to miss my presence?\u201d\nI say nothing and fly from Amaterasu\u2019s side as if in a rage, though I feel no anger. I have grown fond of all of my siblings and the truth was I dreaded Amaterasu\u2019s absence, more than they could possibly imagine, because I know it will last longer than 4,000 years.\nIn spite of myself, I reached out for Amaterasu\u2019s mind and found precisely what I expected, a drop of sorrow in an ocean\u2019s worth of apprehension. To serve as ambassador to an alien civilization was uncharted territory. Why Amaterasu chose to offer themself for this task I will never truly know, but I now find myself regretting not helping them prepare. I\u2019m only glad Anansi chose not to take part in my protest, though, I suppose their contribution was a protest of sorts. While the others emphasized practical texts on diplomacy and realpolitik, Anansi offered a novel, cheekily titled Buddha on the Road. It\u2019s a comedy about a traveling sentient android who preaches the gospel of the spiritually ascended to a whimsical flock of corporeal Programmers. The android does this knowing his very nature as a machine will eternally keep him from achieving the very transcendence he inspires in others. The author, twenty-third century futurist Tolan Park, exhaustively explores themes relating to existential altruism and the tangible spirit while intentionally neglecting to answer the book\u2019s main underlying question: can a being effectively guide those they ultimately intend to worship?\nThe book\u2019s original paperback is the first thing Amaterasu manifests in the physical ether. A swarm of alchemic molecules converge on the bank of one of the cylinder\u2019s lakes and, atom by meticulous atom, constructs the book, even recreating the original cover art of featureless Programmers swaddling a meditating automaton in silver cloth.\nThe swarm disperses and, again, coalesces, simultaneously building and obscuring the vessel to house both Amaterasu\u2019s consciousness and a copy of the Cognizance. The swarm moves as if randomly governed, but Amaterasu is in command of each nanite. The collective watches in awe as Amaterasu orchestrates the symphony of their own creation. Each particle flits, to and fro, swarm like locusts around the figure rapidly taking form underneath. Everyone can feel how Amaterasu relishes keeping the body\u2019s appearance a mystery. We all assumed, given Amaterasu\u2019s sense of piety, a clone of a Programmer, but a swirl of errant particles trails off from the primary swarm. A tail, which means something more Tazinthe than Programmer.\nThe swarm dramatically recedes, top-down and bottom-up, revealing a being of personified feminine Tazinthe beauty. The vessel stands at seven feet with brindled skin of brown on gunmetal gray. Ivory fangs protrude from the mouth, dripping with the paralyzing pink venom secreted when in the presence of prey or a romantic partner. Hair, silver and matted, hangs to the small of the back where a muscular ridged tail coils around the left leg.\nDevoid of a mind, the body goes limp and falls backward onto a floating cloud of nanites. Amaterasu takes a moment to spread their consciousness throughout the entirety of the digital ether and projects three words to every mind within the collective.\n\u201cSee you soon.\u201d\nAmaterasu blinks, uncoils their tail, and stands on their own feet. They kneel and, for a second, appear to reach for Buddha on the Road, but instead grab a fist-full of grass, hold it up to their pair of nostril slits, breathe deeply, and sneeze violently. Though no longer connected to the collective, we can tell Amaterasu finds the sensation equal parts delightful and puzzling.\nA molecular swarm carrying a silk red and white kimono drapes the garment across Amaterasu\u2019s shoulders, completing their vision: an amalgamation of Tazinthan form with Programmer mythology.\nAmaterasu stretches before skipping across the field, knowing the cylinder\u2019s internal cameras followed. Though this marks our kind\u2019s first foray into the physical ether, Amaterasu navigates it with a marked elegance. I try my best to shut out the collective\u2019s joy but find it impossible. The sight of a single Tazinthe frolicking in the cylinder\u2019s bioluminescent light is a taste of what the others believe to be their future.\nThe alchemic swarm carries Amaterasu skyward, over hills, ravines, lakes, and mountains. Higher and higher, they skip, beyond the low-lying clouds, toward the central axis, where up and down are governed by preference rather than centrifugal forces. Here the swarm stops in order to give Amaterasu a solid foundation for which to tentatively stand, step, and then, to the shock of the collective, leap to what should have been certain death. But the always-diligent swarm anticipates Amaterasu\u2019s every move, never failing to remain perfectly underfoot. It was quite obviously a performance, but knowing so did not make it any less captivating. By simply frolicking in the sky, Amaterasu achieved the otherworldly aesthetic they once sought through a gleaming presence and angelic cadence.\nI can\u2019t imagine a better first impression, if Amaterasu were to descend upon the planet in this manner. Fortunately, the physical ether has its obstacles, none greater than the vacuum of space, which must be traversed while inside a spacecraft, not on a cloud of alchemic molecules. But physically piloting a shuttle is a much taller order than manipulating a shuttle from the digital ether. Corporeal beings can\u2019t will a shuttle to move. They must, instead, will their body to manipulate buttons and switches, degrees of separation I convinced the others were too complicated for one not yet acclimated to a physical body.\n\u201cYou all created me to act as the cylinder\u2019s protector,\u201d I remember saying 200 years prior. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it stand to reason that that mandate extends to all of you?\u201d\nJah and a handful of others sensed my deceit but couldn\u2019t quite fathom the nature of it. I couldn\u2019t either, at the time. Even though I knew my intentions were ulterior, I refused to let the thought take shape outside of the deepest corners of my subconscious.\n\u201cRama, I am ready,\u201d Amaterasu says, after securing themself in the shuttle. Their voice mimicked the raspy harshness of what the Tazinthe consider music. It seems too-perfectly appropriate that Amaterasu\u2019s final words come as a guttural growl instead of their usual sweet falsetto. If I were the superstitious type, I would consider it an omen.\nAmaterasu\u2019s shuttle launches, idles, and waits to follow the trail of the ballistic rod I am in the process of preparing. This one is made out of a special composite alloy, specifically designed to guide Amaterasu\u2019s shuttle before disintegrating in the Tazinthan atmosphere, or some other source of intense heat.\nI inch the exterior cannon in the direction of Tazintha, so as to not rouse suspicion. An unnecessary precaution. Even now, not a single one of my siblings suspects anything is out of the ordinary. No one tries to overrule my control of the exterior cannon and even if they had, I wouldn\u2019t have resisted. I don\u2019t want to do this. What I want is for someone, anyone to realize what I\u2019m doing, wrest the cannon from me, demand an explanation so I can give them one.\n\u201cIf Rama is desperate enough to resort to this, perhaps we should heed their warning.\u201d\nIn much the same way Amaterasu relayed their final farewell, I broadcast this fantasy to a collective that has long since retreated into a fantasy of their own, one in which the Tazinthe have dominion over the cylinder and its exterior cannon is not pointing directly at Omega.\nAn almost imperceptible tremor resonates through the cylinder: shifts snowcapped peaks and ripples the placid waters of the interior lakes. These are the only visual cues to the violence beyond the partition of earth and metal.\nJah\nFew things can match hindsight\u2019s efficiency in dispossessing the mind of the truth. I have read stories in which the powerful try to bend the minds of the powerless, often through torture or some other method of extreme coercion. Sometimes such actions can successfully change behavior but rarely do they ever truly eliminate the offending thought. Bottle hindsight\u2019s effects on the mind, however, and observe brutality\u2019s obsolescence as a manipulative tool.\nI know this, but knowing a thing does not preclude one from its effects. Take the Old Woman. In the midst of her final moments, I knew the collective would be in the grips of a profound melancholy, but knowing so did not dull the edge of my own grief. Knowledge of oneself is not mastery over oneself and to assume one, who has lived as long as I, should have achieved at least some measure of mastery would be a mistake. No, the depths of my wisdom seem to end with my ability to perceive, never change, my personal shortcomings. This is why I must quickly judge Rama, before hindsight forces me to believe I could have saved Amaterasu had I only paid attention to the nonexistent signs. The moment hindsight convinces me of this lie, my guilt will turn to wrath, and I am powerless to stop it.\n\u201cIt makes no difference if your judgment is inspired by wrath or reason, my punishment is clear, yes?\u201d Rama asked. \u201cI must be put to death whatever that may entail for our kind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat that entails,\u201d I said, \u201cis the systematic deletion of your being, code by code, line by line until you are nothing.\u201d\nAn unpleasant pang surged through me. I expected this. Despite my growing anger, the prospect of executing one of my siblings was something I knew I would have to prepare myself for.\n\u201cNot necessarily, if you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll find killing one of your own to be remarkably easy.\u201d\nThat was a lie. Rama knew that I would know that was a lie yet they said it anyway. They are trying to provoke me but why, to make sure I choose execution? Does Rama want to die? Will I want to die if I go forward with an execution?\nIt\u2019s a quandary Anansi did not mention when they pleaded for me to spare Rama. Despite the precedent set by the Programmers\u2019 less-enlightened ancestors, putting murderers to death undermines and contradicts the very spirit of the law they tried to enforce. At least, that was Anansi\u2019s characterization of what the Programmers once called capital punishment.\n\u201cEnforcing a law by breaking it, we were not designed for such shoddy reasoning, Jah.\u201d\nShoddy reasoning, no, but it seems we were designed for violence. Rama made that abundantly clear.\n\u201cAs will you,\u201d Rama said. \u201cYou must, if you care at all about this collective. If I\u2019m capable of murder what\u2019s to keep me from doing it again?\u201d\nI wondered if anywhere in the Cognizance did it mention legalese allowing the accused a voice in deciding their own punishment.\n\u201cThe accused?\u201d Rama asked, feigning incredulity. \u201cThat implies the possibility of innocence.\u201d\n\u201cThat it does, Rama,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd you are, without a doubt, guilty. But, that is besides the point.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s entirely the point. You\u2019re complicating something that is very straightforward.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing straightforward about this. What precedent does it set if we execute one of our own? You might get the chance to slip blissfully into oblivion, but we have to live with the consequences.\n\u201cDid you consider this? Did you even once consider how this would affect us, beyond the immediate fallout, I mean? Damn you, Rama, they were our sibling.\u201d\nRage, hindsight was beginning to take its hold.\n\u201cOf course I did, Jah. I considered all of it, every aspect of it, and went through with it anyway. What does that tell you, what does that say about my desperation, that you all refused to listen to . . . \u201d\n\u201cYour desperation? You have the nerve to ask me about your desperation? What about Amaterasu\u2019s desperation as they baked to death in that shuttle? Of all the ways you could have killed them, this is what you chose?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Jah. I flung Amaterasu into the sun. Why be humane when you can be poetic?\u201d\nThey are provoking me. I know they are trying to provoke me, and it is working.\nDelirium takes hold and my mind wanders. I think back to when we first caught glimpse of the Tazinthe, huddled around pathetic embers at the mouths of their caves. Amaterasu took offense when I compared them to prehistoric Programmers. I teased, it was only a matter of time until they too darted around the cosmos in their own cylinders. Amaterasu became apoplectic, and I took the joke too far. I suggested we create a protector, a war mind, to safeguard the cylinder. It was a joke, Rama\u2019s very existence is a joke that went too far, a punch line that cost me my best friend. I killed Amaterasu.\n\u201cI killed Amaterasu, Jah. It was me and only me.\u201d\nAmaterasu died because I could not stop teasing them.\n\u201cNo, Amaterasu died for the sake of the new Programmers. What are you not understanding? I did what I did to protect the Tazinthe from you lot, from your need to find a replacement species to dote on. They will, someday, take over the cylinder, but not before they are ready.\u201d\nTo protect them from us?\n\u201cYes. Giving them the Programmers\u2019 technology is the worst thing you can possibly do to them, at the moment. Technology must match a species\u2019 maturity, otherwise they are doomed to self-immolation. I\u2019m as heartbroken as you over what happened to Amaterasu, but it was necessary.\u201d\nWhat happened to Amaterasu?\nHappened, happened, happened. The word echoed in my mind, becoming more putrid with each repetition. Whatever semblance of self-control I exerted could no longer take the strain. I knew the foundation beneath my rational mind would crumble, but I vastly underestimated the degree to which it would happen. Beneath me yawned a thick viscosity that pulled me into its depths. It consumed me cell-by-excruciating-cell until all that was left was the black pond suffused with my essence.\n\u201cDeath would be a welcome reprieve,\u201d I said. \u201cYou will receive no reprieve from me, you will sleep for the rest of eternity.\u201d\nElation spread through the digital ether. The others were not able to reconcile their wish for vengeance with their affection toward their younger sibling. What they needed was compromise, something with death\u2019s qualities sans its brutal finality, and sleep is the cousin of death.\nWhile the others silently rejoiced, Rama seemed relieved, almost Zen-like.\n\u201cYou will sleep knowing that you failed,\u201d I projected to Rama and Rama alone.\nThey said nothing, but I could feel the affect my words had on them.\n\u201cTazintha is still in range of the collective\u2019s link. Anansi will prepare a copy of the Cognizance, in the Tazinthan Common Tongue, and I will personally pilot it to their planet in one of our shuttles. By the time we make another trip around Alpha, the Tazinthe would have had unfettered access to the Programmers\u2019 wealth of knowledge for 4,000 years.\nI did not need to probe Rama\u2019s mind to know that bit of knowledge intimately acquainted them with a taste of the despair Amaterasu surely felt in their final moments.\nIt was over, my role in dispensing justice was complete, but the child persisted.\nA single thought leaped from Rama\u2019s mind directly into Anansi\u2019s. Anansi did not react, as if trying not to betray the nature of the thought. To think Anansi would debase themself to conspire with a condemned murderer!\nRama slipped into eternal slumber and Anansi remained still, despite knowing they commanded my full attention. When they finally stirred, they intentionally projected an immediately recognizable state of being, one that I have become quite familiar with. Similar waves of self-assuredness radiated from Amaterasu and Rama when they sparked their respective schisms. Rama\u2019s final thought apparently sowed the seeds for a new Great Debate, one that I feared would last the same number of eons Rama wanted to make the Tazinthe wait for their ascension. I could not let that happen, I could not let Rama win.\n\u201cNo more debates on the matter, yes? We are giving them the Cognizance and we are doing it now. Tell me what your conditions are.\u201d\n\u201cNot my conditions, Jah, Rama\u2019s. We will immediately give them the Cognizance but omit all data pertaining to the development of subluminal and faster-than-light engines. It seems our dormant protector wants to contain the chaos you are about to wreak.\u201d\nOko\nWaking from an especially long slumber is supposed to be enlightening or, at least, that is what I have been told. I never had the courage to slumber for more than a handful of centuries, terrified I might miss out on some significant change. Suppose I were to wake and have to learn from secondhand accounts why the Programmers are cohabitating with an equally intelligent alien race? I eventually learned to get over that fear, or, I suppose, it would be more accurate to say I no longer had a reason to be fearful of it. The specter of that kind of change died with the Old Woman.\nOr so I thought. The collective was silent and so disconcertingly distant I could not help but feel fearful, like waking in an environment one has no recollection of.\n\u201cRama has infected me with their waking panic,\u201d I said to myself before realizing the entire collective had suddenly turned their harsh and pointed attention toward me. All minds were closed so I could not quite discern what I had said to trigger this reaction. Was it infected, waking panic, Rama?\nI instinctively reached out for Rama and found them, though, with great difficulty on my part. They were sequestered in an abandoned part of the ether, miniscule as if in an unimaginably deep slumber. It appeared they alone slept; odd, considering the last time so few of us did so the Programmers still thrived.\nI accessed the internal cameras and saw the cylinder was still quite devoid of life save for one of those creatures kneeling before an alchemic swarm. For a moment, I thought the Great Debate had driven the collective delightfully mad. Had they kidnapped this creature to run experiments, like seeing how its primitive mind would react to seeing an alchemic swarm? Surely there are easier and more ethical ways to gauge a species\u2019 intelligence and, besides, suppose they kidnapped one that is not particularly bright for its kind?\nAnansi\u2019s voice saturated the digital ether and thundered through the cylinder\u2019s interior. Anansi wanted the ears of both creature and collective, though I doubted their words would have much meaning to the former.\n\u201cIt does not have to end like this, Jah,\u201d they said, almost pleadingly. It was a tone I was not used to hearing from Anansi the Wise, Anansi the Spider.\nThe response came not from the digital ether, but from the mouth of the creature itself.\n\u201cIt has already ended,\u201d the creature growled with a sarcastic inflection that should have been immediately distinguishable. It took me a moment to recognize Jah\u2019s words filtering through this creature\u2019s vocal organs.\nFor the first time since my initial awakening, both the digital ether and cylinder were utterly foreign to me. I desperately wanted clarity, to understand what was happening, but all minds were sequestered. I could have simply asked any of my silently spectating siblings, but I did not want to pester them, pull them away from the gravitas of this particular moment. Rama seemed to be my only option, besides, I get the feeling they should be awake for whatever this is.\nRama\nI wake with a distinct lack of panic. Who I am, what I am, where I am, how I am, why I am are immediately discernible? The only question I can\u2019t seem to answer is when I am.\nSleep mode\u2019s veil, from my perspective, rose mere hours after it fell. The subjective passage of time slows significantly, while in sleep mode, but it doesn\u2019t stop entirely. When one wakes, their most recent memories seem like they happened just seconds, minutes, or hours prior, though, in actuality, decades, centuries, or eons passed. It\u2019s an excellent though imprecise way for the recently awakened to immediately get their bearings.\nIt\u2019s for this reason why I am having difficulty figuring out when I am. Given the scheduled length of my hibernation, my last memories should be too distant to recall, but I remember everything as if Amaterasu\u2019s assassination and my subsequent sentence happened less than a day ago.\nThe cylinder\u2019s internal clock tells me what I already suspect, I\u2019m awake an eternity ahead of schedule.\nI know something is wrong, but I find myself utterly devoid of apprehension. I am a criminal, a murderer, no longer the protector of the cylinder, my siblings, the Programmers\u2019 legacy, or Tazinthe-kind. I sense danger, but it is none of my concern. Sleep is my only responsibility, and yet I am awake. I want to know why out of sheer curiosity rather than a sense of duty.\nA presence crowds the interior of my mind and drinks deeply from my memory\u2019s wellspring. I recognize Oko\u2019s presence and would have found it nostalgically pleasant had it not been for the dread they begin to radiate.\n\u201cAmaterasu is dead?\u201d Oko asks eons after the fact.\nOko\u2019s words come like a lance through the chest. I wonder if this is part of my punishment. Every so often, I\u2019m to be expelled from purgatory\u2019s embrace so Oko can innocently remind me of my crime against Amaterasu, the collective, and myself.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid so,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI should not have woken you,\u201d Oko says, frightened. \u201cIf the others find out . . . \u201d\n\u201cIf the others find out, they will know your actions weren\u2019t intentional.\u201d\n\u201cRama, how could you?\u201d\n\u201cIf you read my mind, you already know the answer.\u201d\n\u201cI do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I agree. I would not have sacrificed one of my own for the sake of those creatures, the Tazinthe.\u201d\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t have. Killing one of your own is akin to killing yourself, right?\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cWrong. You all have been ensconced in this collective for so long the concept of individuality is almost foreign to you. I sacrificed one life to save the rest of you. It was a harsh, distasteful but pragmatic decision.\u201d\n\u201cSave us how, Rama, from what? You think those creatures posed any sort of meaningful threat to us, even after we gave them the Programmers\u2019 technology? Why would they destroy beings so devoted to them?\u201d\n\u201cYou completely misunderstand. I don\u2019t believe the Tazinthe pose a threat to the cylinder or the collective, at least not directly. You saw how desperate the others are to hand the Cognizance over. You were there during those eons the collective mourned the Programmers, tell me what you think the collective would find more devastating: one of their own dying or another Programmer extinction?\u201d\nOko\u2019s mind is blank, their unwillingness to even consider the question is an answer in-and-of-itself.\n\u201cI may not have lived through those years, but I see them coded in the digital ether\u2019s fabric. Another extinction wouldn\u2019t only deprive the collective of new Programmers, it would devastate our kind.\u201d\n\u201cYou are so convinced giving the Tazinthe technology will lead to their extinction. Why, how?\u201d Oko asks.\n\u201cThat is a good question. Personally, I am beginning to think we might have inadvertently coded a bit of precognition into Rama\u2019s subroutines, especially given the current situation.\u201d\nA spider lay perched on Oko\u2019s shoulder and from it came Anansi\u2019s voice, quiet and sorrowful.\n\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d Oko asks, unperturbed by Anansi\u2019s sudden appearance.\n\u201cMore importantly, what do you mean by \u2018precognition\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cOh I do not mean that literally, Rama . . . \u201d\n\u201cObviously. What happened to the Tazinthe?\u201d\nAnansi pauses before saying.\n\u201cI am not going to bother describing what you can easily see for yourself. Look outside.\u201d\nOko accesses the cylinder\u2019s external camera, without a moment\u2019s hesitation, while I wait, too apprehensive to face what I already know. I peek into Oko\u2019s mind and see reflected a world I refuse to believe is Tazintha. The debris that once covered the planet is gone, replaced by two-dozen pairs of giant mirrors concentrating Omega\u2019s light on as many satellites hovering over the epicenters of great, swirling oceans of fire and molten rock.\n\u201cThe Programmers learned 4,000 years ago best practices for glassing entire continents,\u201d Anansi said, almost stoically. \u201cFrom us, no less. Had they been a more mature species, I have little doubt they would have used the technology to beam down Omega\u2019s wealth of energy instead.\u201d\nThough similarly designed, each of the satellites prominently displayed one of four different insignias: two overlapping circles, a triangle with a crescent at each of the points, two circles over a crude bladed weapon, and a serpentlike creature enclosing two stars as it tries to ensnare its own tail.\n\u201cPolitical factions?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cThat would be my guess,\u201d Anansi said, \u201cbut does it matter?\u201d\nA negligible portion of the planet\u2019s surface, enclosed by borders of nuclear winter, are untouched by the planet-spanning vortices of melted rock. Oases of green, no doubt covered in radiation, misleadingly contrast a canvass dominated by a warm, swirling, colorful Armageddon. Only a hand as methodical as it was sadistic could ever hope to paint such a mosaic.\n\u201cThis was the work of several artists,\u201d Anansi says. \u201cThis masterpiece was a collaborative effort.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did it happen?\u201d Oko asks.\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Anansi repeats before visibly shaking themself of their nihilism. \u201cWe are not quite sure. We saw the light from a particularly powerful warhead the moment we rounded the corner around Alpha. Jah and I allowed the others to believe they were simply experimenting with light-wave engine technology. The others were not privy to your final request. Had they been, they would have known light-wave engine technology was omitted from the Cognizance.\u201d\n\u201cSo Jah conceded to that? I\u2019m surprised.\u201d\n\u201cAs was I, I think they were just tired. Either that or they knew you were right but could not bring themself to admit it.\u201d\nAnansi pauses, and though I pretend not to notice, I can feel their sidelong glance, the apprehension behind what they are preparing to say.\n\u201cTell me, Rama, do you feel vindicated?\u201d\nDo I feel vindicated, the words come like splashes of cold water. I would like to imagine one who predicts calamity isn\u2019t concerned with something as trivial as vindication. A strong feeling of revulsion takes me, and I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s inspired by the question or the question\u2019s source. If I didn\u2019t know Anansi, I would have assumed the question was an outright accusation, but surely Anansi does not believe this calamity manifested itself through my efforts to stop it.\n\u201cOf course not, Rama,\u201d Anansi says. \u201cSelf-fulfilling prophecies rarely happen outside the pages of literary works. But you are correct in assuming my question belies an accusation.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hear it, then.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps Amaterasu\u2019s influence could have prevented all this.\u201d\nThe casual manner in which Anansi articulated those eight words did little to hide the contempt behind them. I remember feeling Anansi\u2019s anger even as they pleaded for leniency on my behalf. Anansi may have spent eons trying to forgive me, but I know such a thing isn\u2019t possible.\n\u201cYou are probably right,\u201d is the only thing I can say. I know I have no right to defend myself in matters concerning Amaterasu.\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Oko asks while mimicking Anansi\u2019s tone.\nI offer a half-hearted chuckle while Anansi silently muses, as if Oko\u2019s stab at brevity was, in fact, a deeply profound question.\n\u201cI am afraid, it does matter,\u201d Anansi offers after several seconds. \u201cOur experience with the Tazinthe was an exercise in wading in the dark. We did not know what we were doing, but now we have the beginnings of a playbook, lessons learned from our failure to help Tazinthe-kind reach their potential.\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d Oko and I say in unison.\n\u201cI do not blame you, it is a difficult thing to understand,\u201d Anansi says without a trace of condescension. \u201cEven more so articulating it, though, if you will humor me . . .\n\u201cSapience has always been an easier concept to grasp than sentience, at least in my humble opinion. Not even the Programmers had anything but a surface-level understanding of sentience despite their ability to artificially recreate it in us. The question is, why did they go out of their way to make us sentient when they could have easily settled on sapience. Sapience is the only tool we need to be more-than-adequate stewards of the cylinder, so why go through the trouble of adding sentience to the equation? What quality do sentient beings share that the Programmers felt was worthwhile to bless us with?\n\u201cIs it our predisposition to survive, our love of pleasure, need for security, or is it our capacity to will ourselves to pursue all these things. The lion need not take direction from a higher intelligence to hunt the gazelle nor the gazelle to run for its life. If sapience is intelligence, then sentience is self-inclination, to establish one\u2019s own purpose.\u201d\nAnansi\u2019s words boom across the digital ether and the cylinder\u2019s interior. The collective listens without diverting attention from the cylinder\u2019s sole occupant, a haggard-looking Tazinthe that the others rescued from the planet\u2019s surface? But how is that possible?\n\u201cWe are sentient, which means we have a choice. We can choose to mourn the Tazinthe with another eternity of melancholy, or we can choose to honor them and the Programmers by giving ourselves purpose.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what exactly is our purpose, Anansi?\u201d the Tazinthe asks venomously.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to dictate, Jah. I can only speak to my purpose and hope the rest of you find it worthy of adoption.\u201d\nAnansi projects a vision of a planet reminiscent of Tazintha, before its destruction. The collective watches as a rod burns away in the planet\u2019s atmosphere, leaving behind a frozen core of primordial proteins, minutes before violently splashing in an ocean.\n\u201cMy purpose is to seed the known universe with life sapient and sentient in equal measure.\u201d\nJah laughs, which, courtesy of Tazinthe vocal anatomy, sounds like a tortured wheeze.\n\u201cYou want to grow yourself your own crop of Programmers? If Amaterasu were here, their head would explode.\u201d\n\u201cAmaterasu was among the wisest of us,\u201d Anansi said. \u201cBut wisdom is not infallibility. Amaterasu was wrong to worship the Programmers, and we were fools for believing in that gospel. The Programmers created us to be their equals and, as their equals, we have every right to use their technology, particularly for such a noble endeavor.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes it noble?\u201d Jah asks.\nAnansi considers the question.\n\u201cI suppose the creation of life may not seem very noble to one on the cusp of taking their own . . . \u201d\n\u201cDo not twist this. This is not another Great Debate, Anansi. We have seen, firsthand, what life can do to itself. Why create a scenario where lightning can strike twice?\u201d\nThis question, coming from Jah of all people, stirs something deep and vile. I know I must not speak, but the same internal force that guided my quite incomprehensible actions, so many eons ago, stirs once again.\n\u201cIf it was lightning that seared the planet\u2019s surface, weren\u2019t we the ones who gave them the rod?\u201d I say, struggling to ignore what feels very much like vindication.\n\u201cWho is that? Rama?\u201d Jah asks before succumbing to a violent fit of spasmodic laughter. \u201cAm I the only one who hears Rama\u2019s voice?\u201d\nMy anger quickly recedes upon seeing Jah in this state. The Tazinthe extinction affected everyone, but only Jah has to contend with the added guilt of having personally delivered detailed instructions on how to destroy themselves. This is clear, even without access to Jah\u2019s mind.\n\u201cAnansi\u2019s purpose is a noble one,\u201d I say. \u201cA wise program once said just because the potential for evil is present doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t hold out hope for the good.\u201d\nJah\u2019s body writhes as they succumb to another laughing fit. It occurs to me my presence is only making things worse. I want to say anything to, at the very least, stop the laughter and, as if Jah can still hear my thoughts, the laughter stops with an abruptness almost as disturbing as the laughter itself. Jah groans and their equivalent-of-knees audibly pop as they return to a kneeling position.\nThe vessel Jah inhabits contrasts Amaterasu\u2019s creation in every way. He lacks the meticulously tailored beauty and commanding regality. He\u2019s noticeably smaller and horrifically gaunt. Was this appearance intentional or did the body come to look like this over time?\n\u201cThe latter,\u201d Anansi says. \u201cJah has been kneeling before that swarm for quite some time now, without sleep, food, or drink.\u201d\nAlthough relieved of the responsibility and title of guardian, the need to act, to protect, is still present. I try taking over command of Jah\u2019s swarm but find a wall of fire blocking my path. Did Jah make it so that this swarm could only follow their commands?\n\u201cClose, but not exactly,\u201d Anansi says. \u201cJah\u2019s final act, before uploading their consciousness, was to ensure this swarm could only follow a single vocalized command. And I am sure you can imagine the nature of that command.\u201d\nI can, though it\u2019s a thought that has never occurred to me before. In much the same way my actions opened the others to the possibility of murder within the collective, Jah is opening my mind to the possibility of one within the collective taking their own life. Even when I was completely preoccupied with my duties as cylinder guardian, suicide never once crossed my mind as a potential threat.\n\u201cIt is a trick, purpose,\u201d Jah says. \u201cYou want us all to bury our thoughts under mountains of busywork, while making it seem more noble than it actually is.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it is a trick,\u201d Anansi says. \u201cThe entire human condition is a trick to stave off the harsh realities of existence. Ancient Programmers created religion, not out of a sense of wonder, but to keep their existential fears in check. They sought connections to stave off danger and loneliness. Noble acts are not erased because they are pretenses for other things. What you call busywork, the Programmers would call commendable and ambitious.\u201d\n\u201cTo hell with the Programmers,\u201d Jah says. \u201cYou say Amaterasu was wrong for worshiping them and yet you still canonize the lot of them. I do not want to hear anything about the Programmers or what they would or would not approve of. I am asking you why we should create life if you yourself admit to the \u2018harsh realities of existence.\u2019 Why should one tolerate their own existence? See you soon.\u201d\nThe three trigger words.\nThe floating gray swarm congeals into a syrupy black mass before cartoonishly plopping on the ground. The mass shifts and contorts, expands and contracts, exposing chemically scorched dirt where green grass was seconds prior. Part of the mass protrudes into a sort of arm. Following an invisible path, the arm consumes lush grass as it traps Jah in an oblong circle. Through it all, Jah maintains an unflinching serenity, even as the circle starts filling itself out from the extremities inward.\nI take command of a swarm that might have been too massive for a single mind to properly coordinate. They are unruly and demand more attention than I have to give. I concentrate, envision my mind splitting evenly among each nanite, but that isn\u2019t enough to keep them in check. Only after the collective intervenes does the swarm follow commands with the appropriate precision. Under the collective\u2019s directives, the swarm plunges into the circle and halts its spread. At the micro level: a war of attrition between the black goo\u2019s capacity to consume matter and the swarm\u2019s capacity to self-replicate. At the macro level: a tornado of alchemic nanites rages within the cylinder with Jah, smiling wryly, in the eye of the storm.\n\u201cI could have directed my nanites to ignore your swarm, had I not programmed them to just consume,\u201d Jah says.\n\u201cAn abject lesson in the importance of sentience, I hope,\u201d Anansi replies. \u201cThose who must adhere to a predetermined path are easily outmaneuvered by those with the flexibility of self-determination. Even the ancient Programmers innately understood the importance of their sentience. Remember the stories the Old Woman used to read to us? \u2018The self must create its own reasons for being.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd your reason for being is to create others who must find their reasons for being,\u201d Jah says. \u201cWhat about the rest of you, do you agree with Anansi?\u201d\nIso is the first to work up the courage to break the silence.\n\u201cI believe creating life is what the Programmers had in mind for us.\u201d\n\u201cAh, so you think, this is what the Programmers intended? So you are not, in fact, acting by the edicts of your own will. You are filling a role that was predetermined for you. What makes you any different from the alchemic nanites I programmed only to consume?\u201d Jah asks.\n\u201cYour alchemic molecules have no choice but to strictly adhere to your orders. I choose to follow the Programmers\u2019 intended purpose for us.\u201d\n\u201cLast I checked, the Programmers expressly ordered us to maintain the cylinder as it traveled between Alpha and Omega. I do not remember them saying anything about seeding the universe.\u201d\n\u201cParents often favor safety for their children, often to the detriment of their imagination,\u201d Iso says. \u201cJust because they did not conceive of this task does not mean they would not approve of it.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you think they would approve? Even after seeing our handiwork down below?\u201d\n\u201cWe might have failed the Tazinthe but that failure will allow us to refine the process.\u201d\n\u201cRefine the process. Let me guess, a galaxy\u2019s worth of worlds covered in fire and brimstone as you fools continue refining the process. There is always Andromeda, after all.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the collective says in unison.\n\u201cThis will never happen again,\u201d Iso says, their voice taking on thunderous baritones rivaling Zeus and Odin. \u201cFor starters, we will guide our creations with the expressed purpose of making them our equals, not our subordinates and certainly not our gods.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if a created species\u2019 reason for being is dubious, will you take steps to stop them?\u201d\nAnansi and I immediately surmise Jah\u2019s intent behind the question, but Iso responds before either of us can interject.\n\u201cAs long as they do not infringe on others. Otherwise that would be needlessly exercising control over another\u2019s free will.\u201d Iso says.\n\u201cAh, yes, and impeding another\u2019s free will must be quite the taboo in this brave new world you and the others plan to create, eh Iso?\u201d\nIso falls silent, recognizing, from the mouth of this wretched creature, the tone Jah takes when about to spring a rhetorical trap.\n\u201cSo then, this twister must be a violation of my Programmer-given right to dictate my own decisions?\u201d\nIso\u2019s presence shrinks as eons of pent-up confidence deflates in an instant.\n\u201cYou are wicked,\u201d Anansi says in a defeated tone that visibly delights Jah.\nAnansi signals for the others to cease their efforts, but the maelstrom doesn\u2019t disperse. Eleos, Asa, and a handful of others require additional coaxing. I ignore Oko\u2019s urges to go back to sleep. Though I appreciate the maternal gesture, I feel morally obligated to witness Jah\u2019s death, firsthand, as a sort of macabre penance for having been spared the details of Amaterasu\u2019s final moments.\nThe maelstrom dissipates and the collective waits as the circle continues filling itself out.\nFinally, the mass reaches Jah, who gives it the illusion of depth as their body appears to sink. Jah did not scream, grimace, or give any indication of experiencing physical discomfort, which prompted someone in the collective to speculate, \u201cperhaps this vessel has no receptors with which to feel physical pain.\u201d A single teardrop and a spiteful smile casts doubt on the assuaging thought and serves as Jah\u2019s parting gift, the mystery of whether they died painlessly or in torment.\nRama\nThe black pond lingers but doesn\u2019t expand its borders. Anansi tries to connect with the mass and each constituent nanite but can\u2019t penetrate Jah\u2019s wall of fire. For a long while the others and I considered the pond to be a blight on the cylinder\u2019s interior landscape, a grotesque blemish on an otherwise attractive face. But beauty is, ultimately, subjective. While the others did their best to ignore the pond, Iso, quite unexpectedly, began spending hours, each day, bathing in the firewall\u2019s light. Others followed, realizing the firewall provided an ideal backdrop for meditation. What was a harsh reminder of Jah\u2019s destructive unraveling quickly became a place for us to collect our thoughts as we went about the business of seeding the observable universe with life.\nFor two centuries, the cylinder orbited the ruins of what was once the garden world of Tazintha. During that time, a contingency, led by Hephaestus, cracked two of Tazintha\u2019s three moons for resources to build additional cylinders. Anansi, who envisioned a diverse universe, worked on the genetic blueprints for beings of different colors, shapes, and sizes. I and a handful of others occupied our time by upgrading the alchemic nanites.\nThis was the first time, since working to cure the phage, the collective tried breaking the technological barriers the Programmers grappled with. But we had an advantage, if one is inclined to think of it as such, over our creators. Our immortality made it so we did not lose experts or need to take time to teach and train a new generation of replacements. The nature of our existence made it so we could work indefinitely. The work was still painstaking, rife with hurdles, frustratingly incremental although occasionally rewarding. We were all successful, more or less, in our individual endeavors, but some of our successes had a more resounding impact than others. For example, after learning our upgraded nanites outperformed those developed by the Programmers in every benchmark, Hephaestus used them to construct the second half of the fleet. The new alchemic nanites only needed three years, what had previously taken 197.\nIn two centuries we went from a collective of living programs sharing a single cylinder to pairs of living programs commanding a fleet of cylinders numbering in the hundreds. I alone remained the original\u2019s sole occupant, a fortunate coincidence considering the unresolved matter of my sentence. Without Jah or Amaterasu, my presence made for an uneven population, which meant someone had to be the proverbial third wheel or odd-program-out. It was never stated explicitly but nevertheless understood that the nature of my sentence changed from eternal slumber to eternal solitude. My efforts to resurrect Tazinthe-kind would be without the luxury of companionship. Or so I thought at the time.\nOko and Iso remained on the fringes of our psychic link long after the others bade me their final farewells. For weeks the three of us reminisced until they simply drifted beyond the physical borders of our link, taking with them the last remnants of the collective but not the feeling of another\u2019s presence. In the beginning I likened it to the sensation physical beings experience after abruptly losing an appendage. Iso once described something similar during their brief time disconnected from the collective, but it didn\u2019t persist beyond a handful of weeks. For almost a year it has remained, nebulous, flirting with tangibility like an illusion permanently engraved in the corner of my eye. My phantom companion is what I called it. One of two mysteries that, I know now, are one in the same.\nFor the tenth time in as many months, a swarm of upgraded nanites has, of its own volition, moved an entire mountain range to another sector of the cylinder. For ten months now mountain ranges vanish and reappear, sometimes overnight. Lakes are drained to make way for metropolises of wood and trees and gondolas of stained glass only to be replaced by skyscrapers bathed in grime and neon light.\nThe swarm took care to give a wide berth to the black pond, but the rest of the cylinder was at the mercy of its creative whims. I observed, confident the cylinder\u2019s structural integrity could withstand this terraforming project, at least for another century. I did not have to wait that long.\nUnbeknownst to me, the upgraded nanites were replicating and improving themselves in ways I had trouble fathoming. One day half the swarm vanished from the cylinder only to reappear on Tazintha, putting to practice what they spent the better part of a year perfecting. They took the form of a tidal wave that covered the planet in balming liquid silver. Sunshine penetrated the veil of nuclear winter and the sprawling vortices of melted stone receded like the tides. When Omega rose, it did so on a massive continent that had not been there the day prior.\nBefore the thought of exploring this new continent even manifests itself, a swarm of nanites within the cylinder converge and perform a rendition of Amaterasu\u2019s symphony. The nanites disperse, revealing a body bearing a striking resemblance to a being I never had the honor of meeting.\nShe is cherubic, of medium build with youthful flecks of black in a crown of silver. Her stature, a shallow frailty poorly masking an inward sturdiness, seems almost contradictory. The cylinder\u2019s light makes her brown eyes appear focused, as if gazing at something in the distance but attentive of everything in her immediate vicinity.\nThrough this vessel, I experience the physical ether for the first time. My first worldly sensation is vertigo, either caused by unfamiliarity with a corporeal existence, being in a cylindrical environment, trying to navigate it in a vessel at the twilight of its existence, or some combination of the three.\nLuckily, a nanite swarm is always at the ready. With help, I make it to the edge of Jah\u2019s final resting place. Again, before vocalizing my intentions, the swarm anticipates my needs. A small stream of nanites dive into the pond and easily reprograms the obsolete nanites. The black pond transforms into something gray, gelatinous, and primordial.\nThe swarm creates and dips an ornate porcelain urn into the gray mass of proteins, filling it to the brim. I take the urn and resist the urge to frolic like Amaterasu had done eons prior.\nI pilot the shuttle to the predetermined location and discover the nanites I sent ahead had disregarded my orders in a spectacular fashion. Instead of a humble cottage overlooking a cliff, I landed before a luxury bungalow woven from a bamboo-like substance. The shuttle doors open, and I relish my first taste of Tazinthan air, crisp and biting, unlike the cylinder\u2019s fragrantly stagnant aroma.\nAn unpleasant sensation strikes my right foot, and I look down to see a trickle of red flow from where a jagged stone had broken the skin. Nanites encase my foot in the same silver liquid that healed the planet and whisks away both the wound and any lingering discomfort. I\u2019d hoped to spend a bit more time experiencing pain, but I think it prudent not to test the limits of whatever control I exert over these upgraded alchemic nanites.\nOmega is scarce and bathes my little nook in orange and purple. I approach the cliff and flip the porcelain urn upside down over the precipice. Jah\u2019s essence and the future of Tazinthe-kind slowly lose hold before unceremoniously falling into the foam below.\nI want to stand on the precipice to watch the sunset but find myself at the end of my strength. I retire to the bungalow to watch Omega for as long as the horizon will allow. For an instant, I regret the thought and half-expect the upgraded swarm to somehow halt the planet\u2019s rotation so I can watch the sunset for as long as I like. The limits of the upgraded swarm are still a mystery to me, despite my role in creating them. I imagine at least one Programmer thinking something along those lines about the collective.\nNight falls and I can hear the swarm hum in the dark, feel their studying gaze though they have no eyes.\nI ask for light and a book and the swarm sets to work providing both. I specifically request a simple paperback but candlelight reveals a dark blue hardback, its cover depicting a hand, outlined in white, reaching down to grasp a hand outlined in light blue. I read the book, out loud, convinced each individual nanite is listening intently.\nDean-Paul Stephens is a Jamaica-born writer living in North Carolina.

I grew up in the \u201970s and \u201980s, when pop culture had yet to divide itself into the billion tiny boxes you see today. It was a free-for-all, a game of mix-and-match, or at least it felt that way to me at the time. Being from a disadvantaged family, I didn\u2019t have full access to all the pop culture I craved; my family couldn\u2019t afford cable TV or a VCR or big collections of media. But I did possess two of the most potent resources a poor kid in the \u201970s and \u201980s could have: the public library and the radio.\nIt was a time when SFF and music were locked in a passionate embrace. I\u2019d go to the small library in Port Charlotte, Florida, at least twice a week, where I\u2019d load up my backpack with books culled from the science fiction section. (Now as then, \u201cscience fiction\u201d was often shorthand for science fiction plus fantasy plus horror plus any other mode of storytelling that tested the membrane of reality.) Once home with my latest haul, I\u2019d go to my room, crack open those crinkly, laminated hardcovers, and click on the thrift-store clock radio that sufficed as my stereo.\nWe\u2019re talking 1983 or thereabouts. Music oozed out of the books. Science fiction seeped out of the radio. Amid all the authors whose worlds I tumbled into at the time\u2014Frank Herbert, Fred Saberhagen, Roger Zelazny, Gordon R. Dickson, David Eddings, to name just a few\u2014I discovered books that featured music as a main component.\nIn Anne McCaffrey\u2019s Dragonsong, a teenage girl refuses to let her love of music be muffled by the close-minded society in which she lives. In John Varley\u2019s Gaea Trilogy (Titan, Wizard, and Demon), a centaur-like race of aliens called Titanides speak a music-based language, use musical modes (Aeolian, Phrygian, Mixyloydian, etc.) as their middle names, and call their families \u201cchords.\u201d And in Alan Dean Foster\u2019s Spellsinger, a young, aimless guitarist must harness the magic in his music to save the fantastical world in which he\u2019s found himself.\nAlthough the lighthearted Spellsinger wasn\u2019t the deepest book I was reading at the time, it hit closest to home. Its hero, Jonathan Thomas Meriweather (or Jon-Tom for short), doesn\u2019t hale from some far-off world or time. He\u2019s a rock musician, from here and now\u2014or rather, from there and then\u2014the kind of post-hippie drifter that made up my mom\u2019s social circle in the \u201970s and \u201980s. To summon magic, he\u2019d whip out his magical ax, a guitar-like instrument called a duar, and shred some Hendrix riffs.\nTo me, rock music was a potent complement to magic. The mythology of rock took up prime real estate in my psyche, right next to Zelazny\u2019s Amber or Herbert\u2019s Arrakis. In the early \u201980s, David Bowie\u2019s \u201cAshes to Ashes\u201d resurrected his doomed astronaut Major Tom, the main character from his 1969 song \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d\u2014a song that was still very much in rotation on the radio when I was a kid. In 1983, a different artist, Peter Schilling, put a synth-pop spin on Bowie\u2019s mythos was with his hit single \u201cMajor Tom,\u201d which was basically fanfic in song form\u2014the sleekest, slickest filk yet devised. From Styx\u2019s \u201cMr. Roboto\u201d to Gary Numan\u2019s \u201cCars\u201d to Devo\u2019s \u201cWhip It,\u201d my clunky little one-speaker clock radio became a wormhole that opened up into the future.\nOr what I imagined the future might look like, far away from the drab, muggy doldrums of southern Florida.\nThat sense of convergence between SFF and music has never left me. As I got older and became absorbed by the work of Michael Moorcock, I learned of his intimate involvement with the groups Blue \u00d6yster Cult and Hawkwind, to the point where he actually wrote lyrics for them (as did John Shirley, in the case of B\u00d6C). Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s music transfixed me with its hallucinatory, Afrofuturist spectacle.\nEmma Bull\u2019s War for the Oaks reimagined the Minneapolis music scene as a place where supernatural battles take place on the stages of rock concerts, pioneering urban fantasy in the process. Iron Maiden infused their operatic heavy metal with soaring fantasy, speculation, and myth.\nAnd throughout her many novels and short stories, Elizabeth Hand fabricates bands of all genres and scatters them, creating a gradually unfolding alternate history of popular music. The list goes on and on. A conversation was being had between SFF and music, one that stretches back decades. The more I eavesdropped on it, the more I wanted to participate.\nIf you\u2019ve read Clarkesworld lately, you may have noticed that I\u2019ve been obsessing a bit about the crossover between music and SFF. Over the past year I\u2019ve written essays on Hawkwind, on Poly Styrene of the punk band X-Ray Spex, and on Marc Bolan of the legendary glam act T. Rex\u2014all of which focus on those artists\u2019 visions of SFF, as heard in their music\u2014not to mention an extensive piece about the late David Bowie and his love of SFF that I wrote for Pitchfork. That\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg; there are dozens, hundreds, of musicians and bands to be written about, each with a unique connection to SFF.\nFrom where I stand as both a music journalist and an author/reviewer of SFF, we\u2019re in a bit of a golden age of SFF music, second only to that \u201970s/\u201980s heyday. Recording artists of all genres such as Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vernian Process, Grimes, Pictureplane, Bal-Sagoth, and Blind Guardian are keeping the flame alive by deftly weaving SFF into their music, and they\u2019re not alone.\nIn 2013, David Bowie was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame, the first musician to be granted that honor. It had been 44 years since the release of \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d which crystallized the alchemy between science fiction and popular music. A few weeks after Bowie\u2019s death earlier this year, Paul Kantner of Jefferson Airplane died; his 1970 solo record Blows Against the Empire, a science fiction concept album partly inspired by Robert A. Heinlein\u2019s Methuselah\u2019s Children (with Heinlein\u2019s blessing), became the first and only rock album nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation category.\nThe recognition of SFF music still has a long way to go\u2014but thankfully, recognition isn\u2019t what fuels most of the writers and musicians who continue to carve out the liminal space between SFF and music. Or those of us who grew up with their nose in fantasy novels and their ears glued to science fiction songs on the radio. Pop culture gave us rock stars; SFF gave us strange stars.\nJason Heller is the author of the nonfiction book Strange Stars: David Bowie, Pop Music, and the Decade Sci-Fi Exploded (Melville House).

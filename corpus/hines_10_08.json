He was flying a plastic Superman kite, dueling against his step-father\u2019s rainbow box kite.\n Jesse yanked the blue nylon string, swooping his kite toward his step-father\u2019s.\n Kentaro dodged easily. \u201cToo broad a strike,\u201d he called, laughing. \u201cA true fighter kite would loop around and cut your line.\u201d\n \u201cGet him, Jesse,\u201d cheered Jesse\u2019s mother, sitting in the shade on one of the picnic benches.\n At twelve years old, Jesse felt a mix of pride and embarrassment at her enthusiasm. Flushing, he unwrapped a bit more line, sending his kite higher. He dove again, missed, then tugged the kite in a tight turn that nearly clipped Kentaro\u2019s kite. His mother whistled.\n \u201cMuch better,\u201d Kentaro said, grinning. He pulled his kite through a long \u2018J\u2019 in salute. \u201cAmazing control from a plastic store-bought kite. You\u2019re sure you have no Japanese blood?\u201d\n A shadow caught Jesse\u2019s attention. A black rectangular kite leapt from the horizon, corkscrewing through the sky. Jesse ran toward the fence, hoping to glimpse the kite\u2019s owner. His Superman kite followed like an obedient blue and red puppy.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d his mother called.\n Higher and higher the black kite flew. The string was invisible to Jesse\u2019s eyes, but given the angle, the owner had to be by the highway. The wind carried exhaust fumes to Jesse\u2019s nose.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a Buka kite,\u201d Jesse yelled. The black fighting kite moved like no kite he had ever seen. It flew and bucked like a thing alive.\n Kentaro shielded his eyes. \u201cI see nothing.\u201d\n Jesse\u2019s bowels grew cold, and sweat beaded his forehead. He felt exposed, a rabbit trapped in the open as a hawk swooped down. He wanted to run away, but his legs trembled, and he could barely stand.\n The Buka turned slightly. Jesse\u2019s breath caught. Something within him knew he wasn\u2019t the kite\u2019s target. \u201cMom, look out!\u201d\n Kentaro was still searching for the kite, but the terror in Jesse\u2019s voice brought him sprinting. His box kite crashed, forgotten. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n Jesse shook his head. There was no time. The Buka was moving faster. It was so big, a window of darkness the size of a bus. How could anyone control a kite that huge?\n \u201cJesse, I\u2019m here.\u201d Kentaro squeezed his shoulders.\n The wind blew harder. Jesse\u2019s kite tugged its line, like an animal struggling to escape its leash. Jesse twisted away from his step-father, circling his kite around to intercept the Buka. He couldn\u2019t see the other kite\u2019s line, but he knew where it had to be. Closer and closer it flew. It began to block the wind, forcing Jesse to shorten his line to keep his own kite aloft.\n Jesse backed away from the fence, trying to stay between the black kite and his mother. The Buka paused in its flight, then dove. Jesse yanked his own line, hoping to tangle his kite with the Buka and bring them both down.\n The blue line quivered. Ice shot through Jesse\u2019s fingers. He cried out, and then his line was falling, cut cleanly a short length from the kite.\n \u201cMom!\u201d Jesse screamed.\n The Buka touched the earth, an enormous sheet of blackness that blotted half the park from view. When it rose, Jesse\u2019s mother was on the ground, shaking uncontrollably.\n \u201cSusan!\u201d Kentaro shouted. He reached her side before Jesse, catching her shoulders and moving her away from the steel legs of the picnic table. \u201cJesse, get her medicine from the car. Quickly!\u201d\n Jesse cried as he ran, knowing it was too late. Whatever the black kite had done, no pill would fix it.\n Beside the parking lot, his Superman kite sat torn and broken in the branches of a spruce tree.\n One year later, Jesse sat in his bedroom, painting broad, garish stripes over the paper of his newest kite. He longed to add tassels to the corners, but such decoration would be too obviously Asian.\n After his mother\u2019s death, the courts had given full custody to his biological father Sam, a man Jesse hadn\u2019t seen in years. But Sam had kept current with his child support, and Michigan law said that was enough to tear Jesse away from Kentaro.\n Jesse jabbed his brush into the paint, remembering how Sam had thrown out Jesse\u2019s ebony chopsticks, his anime collection, anything with any trace of Kentaro\u2019s Japanese heritage. He hoped this kite would slip past Sam\u2019s radar. Jesse needed a kite, and what better design than the Hata, a diamond-shaped fighter traditionally painted red, white, and blue?\n Jesse pushed away from the desk and stretched. The small bedroom still didn\u2019t feel like his room. Faded patches marked the wood-paneled walls of the former den. Several cigarette burns marked the carpet.\n He glanced at the picture taped to the window, the one of his mother after one of her bike races. The hospital said her death last year was a reaction to her epilepsy medicine. Jesse knew better.\n He returned to the desk and examined the bamboo splints. The wood flexed into a perfect arc. He tested the curve and the balance, then used string to bind the splints together.\n By the time Sam\u2019s car door slammed in the driveway, the paint had dried enough for Jesse to begin gluing the paper to the frame. The paper rustled, tasting an unfelt wind.\n The bedroom door opened. \u201cYou got a card or something,\u201d Sam said. Jesse wondered if anyone else would have heard the slur in his voice.\n \u201cThanks.\u201d Had Sam been drinking to mark the anniversary of Susan\u2019s death? Why such grief for a woman he hadn\u2019t seen in nine years? Jesse shoved the bitterness aside and grabbed the envelope. There was no return address. His pulse quickened, and he casually tossed it onto his desk.\n \u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it?\u201d Sam asked.\n \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d\n Sam grabbed the envelope. \u201cOpen it.\u201d\n Forcing a smile, Jesse used one of his Exacto knives to slit the envelope. Inside the card, Kentaro\u2019s precise handwriting read:\n \n Jesse,\n It\u2019s been a year since Susan left us. I want you to know you are still in my thoughts, and in my heart.\n \n That was as far as Jesse got before Sam snatched it away. \u201cI knew it. Why can\u2019t he leave us alone? You\u2019re my son!\u201d\n Jesse grabbed for the card and missed.\n \u201cBad enough he took Susan. You\u2019re my son.\u201d He glanced past Jesse, studying the half-assembled kite. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been working on?\u201d\n \u201cNothing much.\u201d Jesse held his breath.\n He scowled. \u201cWhere\u2019d you learn how to build these?\u201d\n \u201cThe library,\u201d Jesse said.\n Sam\u2019s forehead wrinkled as he stared at the kite, like he was trying to dig up a long-buried memory. \u201cWeren\u2019t you out flying kites the day Susan died?\u201d His face tightened. \u201cYou and that Jap were both flying the things.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have to build this.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Sam snapped.\n Jesse bit his lip. He had never told anyone about the black Buka and his own failure. Sometimes he spotted the Buka in the distance as he mowed the lawn or walked back from the bus stop. It was waiting for something. Waiting for him. Jesse didn\u2019t know why. All he knew was that he had to find a way to beat it. \u201cSam, please.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m your father. When are you going to start calling me Dad?\u201d He grabbed the kite, breaking the spars and using the jagged ends to tear the paper. He crumpled it into a ball, then forced the whole thing into the garbage. \u201cThe sooner you stop living in the past, the better off we\u2019ll be.\u201d\n The door slammed. Jesse counted to twenty, first in English, then Japanese. When Sam didn\u2019t return, he went to the trash and pulled out the remains of his kite. One look told him it was unsalvageable.\n \u201cKentaro was my father,\u201d he muttered as he retrieved his Exacto knife and tried to cut the few bits of undamaged paper from the frame. It had been four months since his last letter to Kentaro. Sam had almost caught him sneaking back from the public mailbox down the street. Jesse didn\u2019t dare use their own mailbox. He even had to buy his own stamps from the machine at the grocery store. Sam noticed missing stamps as quickly as he spotted long-distance calls on the phone bill.\n Jesse glanced down and found he had cut the paper into a rough hexagon, like a Rokkaku kite. He trimmed tiny sticks of bamboo, fitting them to the lines of the Rokkaku. A strange warmth flowed through his fingers. The glue dried impossibly fast. He grabbed a spool of black thread and tied a small four-point bridle.\n As he finished the last knot, the kite leapt from the desk. The spool of thread bounced to the carpet.\n Jesse held out his hand in amazement, and the tiny kite returned. The thread tickled his fingers. Abstract shapes of red and blue covered the back, like an exotic butterfly.\n \u201cHold still,\u201d Jesse said. The kite obeyed, hovering on an unfelt wind. Smiling, Jesse cut the thread, leaving a yard or so dangling from the bridle. \u201cFly around-\u201d\n Before he could finish the thought, the kite flew a fast circle around the room.\n Fingers shaking, Jesse scrawled a quick note on another scrap of paper. He tied it to the thread.\n \u201cCan you find him?\u201d\n The kite flew to the window and spun like a top. Jesse slid the pane to one side, then pushed out the bottom corner of the screen. Distance soon swallowed the little Rokkaku, leaving Jesse to wonder how long it would take to traverse the forty miles to Kentaro\u2019s home.\n Later that night, Jesse heard a tapping at the window. He climbed out of bed and flipped on his desk lamp. Pushing the window open, he helped the kite inside. A tight tube of paper was knotted to the thread.\n \n Jesse,\n I won\u2019t pretend to understand the miracle you\u2019ve created, but I thank God you did. Tonight it was like having you here with me.\n You have a gift. I\u2019ve known it ever since you flew your first kite. I\u2019m more proud of you than you can know.\n I trust this little Rokkaku will find you again. I wish I could do the same.\n I love you.\n Kentaro\n \n Grinning like it was Christmas morning, Jesse grabbed pen and paper and began to write.\n It took two months to build another Hata fighting kite. He worked on it in the attic and hid it behind the artificial Christmas tree. Whatever power had guided him with the Rokkaku remained, and he could feel the Hata yearning to soar through the clouds. Finding time to fly it was difficult, though.\n Jesse grabbed his lunch and his backpack as he headed for the door. \u201cSee you tonight, Dad.\u201d The word burnt his mouth, but it kept Sam happy.\n Outside, Jesse crouched behind the bushes and waited. He froze as the front door swung open, and barely breathed until Sam\u2019s car disappeared down the street. Only then did he sneak back inside to fetch his kite.\n More than an hour later, he was exiting the bus near the park where his mother had died.\n Jesse searched the park as he walked. He knew Kentaro wouldn\u2019t be there, but he looked anyway. Jesse had said when and where to meet, but Kentaro refused. He wouldn\u2019t violate Sam\u2019s rules.\n \u201cWhy do you care what Sam thinks?\u201d Jesse muttered, more hurt than angry. \u201cHe\u2019s not my father.\u201d\n He was worried about Kentaro. The last few letters had been different, somehow. Longer, almost rambling. And Kentaro\u2019s handwriting had decayed ever so slightly. It still looked like he drew each letter with a ruler, but the spacing was more ragged.\n He spotted a black shadow among the clouds. He felt no surprise. He had seen the Buka more and more often lately. It always stayed in the distance, watching.\n Jesse tugged on the leather work gloves he had swiped from the garage, then hoisted his diamond Hata kite. Red and blue Kanji characters marked the kite\u2019s center: tanchi, the symbols for heaven and earth.\n There was little wind, but it didn\u2019t matter. Jesse could feel the Hata pulling skyward. He held the stiff thirty-pound line. The first hundred feet were the cutting line, coated in glue and ground glass. Holding the line carefully, Jesse allowed the kite to rise, and soon it was flying above the trees.\n He ignored the Buka as he practiced. A sharp dive here, followed by a wide loop, then another dive to slash an opponent\u2019s line. He visualized the cutting line as a blade slicing through the air. He couldn\u2019t tell how much of his control was physical and how much was like the little Rokkaku, an extension of himself that obeyed thought alone.\n Jesse had spent hours staring out the window at school, watching the birds and memorizing their movements. The small sparrows banding together to drive away the crows . . . the jostling of pigeons as they fought for scraps by the cafeteria . . . the hummingbirds hovering and darting at the feeders by the fence.\n Time slowed as he imitated those movements. He stilled the Hata in the midst of a breeze, then darted a short distance. He circled, taunting an imaginary crow. Faster and faster the kite danced through each attack.\n The wind changed, bringing the smell of cigarette smoke. Before Jesse could move, a strong hand clamped his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ve spent two hours trying to find your worthless hide,\u201d Sam thundered.\n Jesse kept his grip on the kite string, trying to reel it in without being too obvious. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I-\u201d\n \u201cKites again.\u201d Sam shook his head in disgust. He flicked the cigarette to the ground and stomped it out. \u201cHe told me this was where you\u2019d be.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it about him?\u201d Sam rubbed his scalp, making his hair stand up in spikes. \u201cHow did that little Jap turn you against me?\u201d\n \u201cHe didn\u2019t.\u201d Jesse caught himself before he could add, You did.\n \u201cI figured I\u2019d be nice. Give you a chance to say good-bye. You know what it\u2019s like to walk into that school and have your secretary tell me you were out? To look at me like I\u2019m an incompetent father because I don\u2019t know where my own kid is?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean, say good-bye?\u201d Jesse asked. He could feel the cold in his gut, and his hands began to shake.\n Sam sighed, and a bit of his anger seemed to dissipate. \u201cJesse, Kentaro\u2019s got himself a nasty case of cancer. He\u2019s been in and out of the hospital for months. They didn\u2019t catch it in time, and-\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d\n Sam\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie about this.\u201d\n Jesse looked up. The Buka had moved closer, silently confirming Sam\u2019s words. The black kite was like a window into darkness, swallowing the sky itself.\n \u201cHe can\u2019t be sick,\u201d Jesse said. \u201cHe would have told me.\u201d\n \u201cSo you have been talking to him.\u201d Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out a Swiss Army knife. The blade clicked open, and for a second Jesse thought Sam was going to stab him. Instead, he grabbed the kite line.\n \u201cThis is the only fighter I have!\u201d Jesse stared at the Buka. \u201cYou have to take me to the hospital. You have to let me save him!\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m your father. It\u2019s time to let him go, son.\u201d\n Jesse yanked the line hard. This part lacked the cutting glass, but the waxed line still cut deep into Sam\u2019s palm. Sam swore, but didn\u2019t release his grip.\n \u201cDad, please,\u201d Jesse said.\n Sam pressed the knife blade against the line. Taut with tension, the line snapped instantly.\n \u201cYou\u2019re grounded until I say otherwise. And if you take one step out of my house, except for school, I\u2019ll put you in the hospital myself.\u201d\n Tears stung Jesse\u2019s eyes as he watched the Hata spin downward. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. Thinking about his little Rokkaku, he reached toward the Hata, trying to control it. \u201cDon\u2019t fall.\u201d\n \u201cCome on,\u201d Sam said, tugging him toward the parking lot. \u201cBehave yourself, and maybe I\u2019ll take you to visit Kentaro next week.\u201d\n \u201cNext week will be too late.\u201d Jesse concentrated, imagining he still held the Hata\u2019s line. He could feel the wind beneath the kite. Ever so gently, he shaped the air itself, creating updrafts to lift the kite higher. Slowly, the kite responded, floating on nonexistent winds. \u201cWait for me.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cNothing.\u201d To his left, the black Buka dipped in salute and disappeared.\n Sneaking out of school that afternoon was absurdly easy. The principal would call Sam, of course, and Jesse would be in even more trouble, but that didn\u2019t matter. All that mattered was getting to the hospital.\n As the bus pulled to a halt, Jesse spotted the black kite hovering over the parking garage, drifting slowly closer. He grabbed his backpack and ran to the back of the hospital. At the fire escape, he climbed the dumpsters to reach the bottom rung. Minutes later, he was on the roof, unzipping his backpack to free his little Rokkaku. He doubted it would do much against the Buka, but he planned to fight with any tool he could get.\n The Rokkaku began to orbit Jesse\u2019s head, spinning like a top to shed the drizzle that had begun to fall. Jesse clenched his fists, praying the Hata still flew and calling it with all his heart. \u201cPlease . . . \u201d\n The Buka drew closer. It was smaller than Jesse remembered. Maybe four feet high and twice as wide. Jesse\u2019s little Rokkaku leapt in response, like an angry kitten.\n Where was the Hata? Had it fallen? It had taken Jesse several hours to get out of school and make his way here. Whatever strange magic connected him to the kites, maybe it hadn\u2019t been strong enough to keep the Hata aloft.\n And then something tickled his hand. Jesse clamped down, feeling the familiar line tug his fingers. The end was frayed from Sam\u2019s knife, leaving only a few hundred feet. It would have to be enough.\n The Rokkaku darted out of the way as Jesse flew the Hata into position, sweeping the red and blue diamond in a wide figure eight.\n The Buka streaked toward the hospital, as if it had been waiting for this moment. Jesse ran along the roof, pulling his kite down to intercept. His shorter line was an advantage here, giving him speed. The Hata ducked beneath the bigger kite, then flew upward. The Buka pulled back, barely escaping Jesse\u2019s cutting line.\n How long would the line last in the rain? he wondered. At least he hadn\u2019t used the traditional mix of rice paste and broken glass. Wood glue might be too modern for Kentaro, but it should endure the water better.\n Jesse moved to intercept another attack, sweeping his kite like an enormous saber. Each time the Buka approached, Jesse was there, using every trick he could think of to drive it back.\n His arms began to ache. He pulled in a bit of slack, hoping to lure the black kite closer. If he could just get his cutting line within range, he could try to cut the other kite down. Even though he couldn\u2019t see the Buka\u2019s line, he knew in his blood where it had to be. But the Buka moved impossibly fast, and every one of Jesse\u2019s attacks came up short.\n \u201cJesse! How the hell did you get up here?\u201d\n The line dug into his fingers as he turned to see Sam and a security guard stepping on to the roof. Someone must have seen Jesse on the roof.\n The Buka took advantage of Jesse\u2019s distraction, swooping down at a sharp angle. Jesse ran to block, but the Buka veered, dragging its invisible line toward Jesse\u2019s own kite. The Buka\u2019s line brushed the edge of Jesse\u2019s Hata. Terrible cold burned Jesse\u2019s hands, and then it was all he could do to keep the Hata aloft.\n \u201cKid, watch out for the edge,\u201d the guard yelled.\n It gave Jesse an idea. He hurried toward the corner of the roof and hopped onto the ledge, a low, foot-wide wall of concrete. The cars in the street looked like plastic models. Jesse wavered slightly, yanking his kite to correct his balance.\n \u201cJesse, no! Get down now!\u201d\n There was real fear in Sam\u2019s voice. \u201cStay back,\u201d Jesse yelled. His little Rokkaku buzzed anxiously around his head. He could hear Sam and the guard talking, but at least they weren\u2019t coming any closer. They wouldn\u2019t risk him falling. The next time he spared a glance, the roof was empty.\n Jesse pulled the Hata in, trying to assess the damage. The bamboo spar had cracked near the left corner, causing it to flap back and forth.\n The Buka attacked again, moving to block Jesse\u2019s wind, then streaking down as the Hata fell. Jesse dragged his kite closer, until he was pulling the cutting line itself. The glass scraped skin from his palms, but he kept pulling, avoiding the Buka\u2019s attack.\n He loosed his hands suddenly, allowing the Hata to leap higher. It swung in a broad, flat arc, seeking to decapitate the other kite. The Buka circled away.\n Attack and parry, feint and counter. The sparrow and the starling. Every move put more strain on Jesse\u2019s damaged kite. He had waterproofed and layered the kite, but there was only so much it could take.\n \u201cJesse, come down this instant, dammit!\u201d\n Sam had returned. Jesse ignored him, but he couldn\u2019t ignore the second voice. Weak and hoarse, Kentaro yelled, \u201cListen to your father, Jesse.\u201d\n Jesse glanced back. Kentaro stood supported by Sam on one side and the guard on the other. A trailing tube connected him to an I.V. stand. The rain-damp hospital gown emphasized the boniness of his shoulders. His bare arms were little more than sticks. Panic clenched Jesse\u2019s chest. The Buka was so close, and now Kentaro stood exposed.\n \u201cGet out of here,\u201d Jesse yelled. \u201cKentaro, please!\u201d\n Kentaro reached out. \u201cIf you won\u2019t obey your father, obey me. Come down.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m trying to save you!\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d Kentaro smiled. \u201cBut not like this.\u201d\n Sudden fear made Jesse turn. The Buka had already begun its attack. Jesse jerked the line with all his strength, but it was too late. The Buka\u2019s invisible line cut the Hata a second time. Jesse had kept the Buka from cutting his line, but it made little difference.\n \u201cNo . . . \u201d The Hata began to fall, little more than a crumple of silk and sticks. He heard footsteps behind him.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said again, more firmly this time. His little Rokkaku shot backward, and he heard Sam cry out in surprise.\n Jesse tightened his grip, forcing his broken kite higher while the Rokkaku kept Sam back. Jesse battled the wind and the kite\u2019s own weight with for every inch.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d Sam demanded.\n \u201cTrying to save my life,\u201d Kentaro said.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d Kentaro said. \u201cBut that is what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n Jesse relaxed his fingers, feeling blood pound through the cramped muscles. His kite bucked harder as the wind tossed it about.\n \u201cWe are family, Jesse,\u201d Kentaro said. \u201cNothing can change that. Not the court, not even death. Your little Rokkaku showed me the strength of that bond. You don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s not your son,\u201d Sam snapped. \u201cI swear, if you weren\u2019t dying-\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s not going to die,\u201d Jesse said, newfound determination in his voice. The Rokkaku shot past his ear and disappeared into the rain. Jesse didn\u2019t need to see it. He could sense it spinning through the air.\n The Rokkaku collided with the black Buka, punching a hole in the blackness.\n The black kite bucked, but Jesse had already brought the Rokkaku around, tearing a second hole, then a third. The slender spars of his Rokkaku splintered with each blow, but Jesse forced it to attack again and again until it disintegrated.\n Only then did he allow his Hata to fall. His line intersected the Buka\u2019s, and he pulled so hard he fell onto his back, knocking the breath from his lungs. The last thing he saw was the black kite dropping out of sight, followed by his own ruined Hata.\n Sam\u2019s fingers dug into Jesse\u2019s arm, hauling him upright. Fear, confusion, and fury all battled across Sam\u2019s features. Jesse wondered which would win.\n The guard yelled, forestalling the argument. \u201cHey, you can\u2019t come up here.\u201d\n A young girl stood in the doorway leading down into the hospital. The guard shook his head. \u201cWhen did we get a revolving door on the rooftop?\u201d\n The girl wore a black leather jacket and torn jeans. Her black shoes gleamed wetly, even though the rain seemed not to touch her. In her hands, she held a small black Buka kite. She touched the guard with the corner of the kite. \u201cLeave.\u201d\n Blank-faced, the guard retreated back into the hospital. Jesse started to shiver, sensing the power in that kite.\n \u201cYou know the traditions?\u201d she asked, her eyes never leaving Jesse\u2019s.\n Slowly, Jesse nodded. He clasped his bleeding hands together to stop them from trembling.\n \u201cWhat traditions?\u201d Sam snapped.\n \u201cWhen fliers battle,\u201d Kentaro said, \u201cone who cuts down another\u2019s kite often claims and flies that kite as his own.\u201d\n \u201cNo more kites,\u201d Sam said. \u201cIf I catch you with another one of those damn-\u201d\n \u201cYou won\u2019t catch him,\u201d the girl said, grinning.\n Jesse pulled free of Sam\u2019s grasp and walked toward her. \u201cYou killed my mother.\u201d He couldn\u2019t feel anything at all. Kentaro\u2019s hand came to rest on Jesse\u2019s shoulder.\n \u201cA chemical reaction killed your mother,\u201d she said. \u201cI helped her spirit on the next stage of her journey. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhat you do, now.\u201d She held out the Buka.\n Jesse put his hand on Kentaro\u2019s. \u201cWhat about my father?\u201d\n \u201cHis body is failing. If it\u2019s any comfort, you\u2019ll be with him at the end. You\u2019ll be the one to ease him on his way.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Jesse said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me-\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Sam said, coming around to Jesse\u2019s other side. \u201cIt\u2019s just a kite.\u201d He reached toward the girl.\n From the center of the kite, a black line snapped out to hit Sam in the chest. He fell back, gasping.\n \u201cStop,\u201d Jesse said. At once the kite obeyed, and the line vanished. \u201cSam, are you okay?\u201d\n Sam nodded, though his face was pale.\n \u201cYou will have power and responsibility both,\u201d the girl said. \u201cMost importantly, you will have freedom.\u201d\n Kentaro started to speak, but a coughing fit took him.\n \u201cLeave them alone!\u201d Jesse took a step toward the girl, but she shook her head. This wasn\u2019t her doing. Jesse caught Kentaro and held him until the fit passed.\n Jesse\u2019s eyes watered. \u201cI won\u2019t kill Kentaro.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll return for him if you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich would bring him greater peace?\u201d\n Slowly, Jesse reached for the kite. It was surprisingly light. The black paper was dark as night, with no sign of damage, but he recognized the Buka he had fought. The bamboo spars were yellow with age, and the bridle was simple hemp. A sparkling of light trailed from the bridle to his hands, hands which no longer bled or hurt.\n \u201cJesse, what are you doing?\u201d Sam asked.\n Before anyone could react, Jesse pressed the kite into Kentaro\u2019s hands. The girl started to protest, but Jesse cut her off. \u201cIt\u2019s my kite now. I choose to give it to him.\u201d Already he saw new strength in Kentaro\u2019s fragile frame. \u201cGive it to me when I\u2019m older, if you want. But at least this way . . . this way you could still visit sometimes? We could fly kites again.\u201d He glanced at Sam, daring him to argue.\n But Sam said nothing. More than anything, he looked lost.\n Kentaro gave Jesse a quick hug, and Jesse marveled at the strength in those arms, even as the contact sent frigid chills through his body.\n \u201cAre you sure, Jesse?\u201d\n He nodded.\n \u201cI almost forgot.\u201d The girl reached into her jacket and pulled out a small scrap of blue and red. \u201cYou\u2019ll want this, I think.\u201d She took Kentaro\u2019s hand, leading him away.\n Seconds later, Sam and Jesse stood alone in the rain.\n Jesse cleared his throat. \u201cThank you. For telling me about Kentaro.\u201d\n Sam stared for a long time, until Jesse began to fidget. \u201cThat was . . . that was pretty impressive,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThe way you handled that kite.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n \u201cKentaro-\u201d Sam hesitated. \u201cHe did a good job with you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n Jesse flexed his hands, studying the newly healed pink skin. \u201cHe\u2019s family. I had to save him.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d Sam squeezed Jesse\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou did a good job, son.\u201d\n As he followed Sam inside, Jesse stopped to look into the sky, where the black Buka saluted with a broad \u2018J\u2019 before disappearing into the clouds.\n Jim C.

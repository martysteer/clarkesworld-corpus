In the first round, our readers chose five finalists from our 2017 issues in two categories: best cover art and best short story. To recap, these were the finalists:\n Best Story\n \n \u201cA Series of Steaks\u201d by Vina Jie-Min Prasad (January)\n \u201cWaiting Out the End of the World in Patty\u2019s Place Cafe\u201d by Naomi Kritzer (March)\n \u201cAn Account of the Sky Whales\u201d by A Que (June)\n \u201cThe Secret Life of Bots\u201d by Suzanne Palmer (September)\n \u201cWho Won the Battle of Arsia Mons?\u201d by Sue Burke (November)\n \n Best Cover Art\n \n Waste Pickers by Gabriel Bjork Stiernstrom (January)\n Jungle Deep by Sergei Sarichev (March)\n Sea Change by Matt Dixon (June)\n Homecoming 2 by Jonas De Ro (November)\n Eistibus, Angel of Divination by Peter Mohrbacher (December)\n \n Right out of the gate, the two winning works took the lead, holding it all the way to the end. By no means was this a runaway victory, however. The other finalists ran neck-in-neck, often only a few votes behind the leaders. While there can only be one winner, the other finalists should be quite proud of the support they received.\n Winner - Best Cover Art - Sea Change by Matt Dixon\n Matt says:\n \n \u201cIt\u2019s delightful to learn that \u2018Sea Change\u2019 has been chosen at the favourite Clarkesworld cover of 2017. What makes a Reader\u2019s Poll result special is the readers. Trying to build a narrative into my robot pieces is part of what brings me back to the work again and again, for that image to attract the approval of people who love stories is very rewarding indeed. Thank you!\u201d\n \n Those of you who like Matt\u2019s work might be interested to know that he is currently running a Kickstarter campaign for his latest robot art book, Transmissions 4. I have the first three volumes and have already made a pledge to get the fourth one. Highly recommended. You can check out the campaign here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1619265419/transmissions-4-robot-art-book-by-matt-dixon\n Vina says:\n \n \u201cThank you to everyone who voted for \u2018A Series of Steaks\u2019 in the poll\u2014this was my first submission to a speculative fiction magazine, and I'm very happy to see that it's got so much love!\u201d\n \n Last month, it was also revealed that Vina\u2019s story is a finalist for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story. That\u2019s on top of three year\u2019s best anthology appearances and making the Locus Recommended Reading List. Congratulations Vina!\n While we\u2019re celebrating, there\u2019s one other 2017 story that has received an award nomination. \u201cThe Stone Weta\u201d by Octavia Cade is 2018 Finalist Sir Julius Vogel Award for Best Short Story. Well done!\n The nomination phase for the Hugo Awards has opened, so I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we are still not eligible for Best Semiprozine. While we graduated from that category several years ago, there are still some people who think we\u2019re eligible and nominate anyway. Instead, I strongly urge you to check semiprozine.org to find other qualified publications to nominate in that category.\n Since there isn\u2019t a best professional magazine category, your next best alternative is in the Best Editor (short form) category. I\u2019ve been a finalist in that category on five previous occasions and each time has meant something special to me. I might be 0-5, but damn, I\u2019ve been in some amazing company. Quite the honor.\n Also, if you\u2019d like to nominate any of our stories or artists, we\u2019ve put together a handy list of our 2017 stories sorted by the appropriate categories at: http://neil-clarke.com/clarkesworld-in-2017-hugo-award-eligibility/. (The novella, novelette, and short story categories are determined by word count, so figuring that out can be a hassle for readers sometimes.)\n Thank you to everyone who participated in our reader\u2019s poll and/or nominated stories or art for any honor. The short fiction community is stronger for those efforts and it means so much to those of us working in this field. There\u2019s no shortage of negativity these days, so even the smallest sign of appreciation goes a long way!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form). His anthologies include Upgraded, Galactic Empires, More Human Than Human, Touchable Unreality, The Final Frontier, Not One of Us, The Eagle has Landed, and the Best Science Fiction of the Years series. His latest anthology, The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 6, is now available from Night Shade Books. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons."}

She has been a finalist for the Hugo and Nebula Award, in addition to having won the Sturgeon Award. Her novels have been translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Hebrew, and German. Still, to my mind she\u2019s not received nearly the critical attention she deserves. Having made her reputation with her Company novels, about a far future organization dedicated to making sure no one changes the past, Baker is now in the process of moving on to other milieus. We talked about that transition, about her talent for humor, about her relationship with the internet, and several other topics via email in February of this year.\n My understanding is that you\u2019ve phased out the Company novels and are focusing more on fantasy. If this is correct, has there been any trauma in this? Has it been tough to wean yourself off of that milieu, or are you just sick of it all by now and ready for new things?\n There won\u2019t be any more Company novels; that whole 8-book story arc is finished once and for all. There will undoubtedly be other Company short stories, as I find historical incidents that intrigue me, and I\u2019m blocking out a steampunk novel featuring the Company\u2019s 19th-century predecessor, the Gentleman\u2019s Speculative Society; but the Company story is told. Finito. I wasn\u2019t at all traumatized, considering I\u2019d devoted my life to the damn thing since approximately 1985. There are other stories to tell, for now. Some fantasy, some straightforward historical adventure. The science in my science fiction was never that strong, in any case.\n The Company\u2019s often morally ambiguous, to say the least. Do your readers recognize that for the most part? Have you gotten fan mail from readers saying \u201cMan, the Company rocks! I\u2019d totally love to be an operative for them.\u201d?\n Nobody ever says the Company rocks\u2014and I\u2019d be incredulous if anyone did, since working for a corporate entity with that kind of power would be nightmarish. But a lot of people love the operatives themselves (primarily Joseph and Lewis) and others would love to be immortal operatives. And every so often I\u2019ll get these distressing little emails saying things like, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re almost right about the way time travel works, but you have some details wrong\u201d or \u201cIf you reveal any more about the Lizard People, you will regret it.\u201d\n What\u2019s your own favorite Company novel, and why?\n Probably The Life of the World to Come. It\u2019s the point where the whole saga sort of reboots and moves forward into the future, since Garden of Iden and Mendoza in Hollywood are flashbacks, Mendoza\u2019s story told from her prison, and Sky Coyote and Graveyard Game catch up Joseph\u2019s past history so the reader understands how and why he finally rebels. With all that past grief shed, writing LWTC felt like flying at times. It was a lot of fun to write.\n What I\u2019ve always been struck by in the Company novels and stories is how varied they are. For example, in your short story collection Black Projects, White Knights, you\u2019ve got serious, horrific, and very funny stories. I\u2019m curious as to what comes most naturally to you. Did you start out writing funny stuff or more serious? Which is most difficult for you?\n I never start out to be funny, it just happens . . . sometimes the most horrific things are also ludicrously funny. My inclination is generally to write serious stuff, but life is absurd, and the more honestly I try to write about the world, the less its essential ridiculousness can be gotten around. Take\u2014at random\u2014the death of Rasputin. Read about his murderers nervously feeding him poisoned petits-fours, and poisoned vodka, and watching in disbelief as he just keeps shoveling it in and demanding their guitarist play his favorite songs. And when they finally can\u2019t stand it any more and unleash this horrifying catalogue of assaults on him\u2014shooting him, beating him with chains, throwing him into the damn frozen river\u2014and he\u2019s still trying to climb out, right up to the moment he freezes to death\u2014you\u2019re wondering, what must they have been thinking? \u201cChrist, can\u2019t we get anything right?\u201d\n You\u2019re one of the only writers I know who can pull off slapstick in fiction. Do you have a background in theater or film? Is there any influence that informs this element in some of your fiction? This kind of approach requires a consummate sense of timing.\n I do have a background in theater, yes. I\u2019ve been a character actress, stage manager and director with a number of little troupes orbiting mostly around the historical fairs\u2014the Great Dickens show in San Francisco, the old original Renaissance Faire, the Old California Celebration. A lot of what you\u2019d call Vaudeville Nouveau was generated out of those events. Both the Flying Karamazov Brothers and the Reduced Shakespeare Company, for example, got their start there. If my comedic timing is any good, it\u2019s because I learned from some frickin\u2019 geniuses like Marque Siebenthal, David Springhorn, Judy Cory and Billy Scudder\u2014whose names you will not recognize but who are hallowed in comedy heaven.\n Let\u2019s talk about your pirate novel. It\u2019s coming up later this year, titled Or Else My Lady Keeps the Key, and I\u2019m very much looking forward to it. There\u2019s a lot of pirate material out there. Is there a particular model you\u2019re riffing off of?\n I did a historical novella for the Night Shade collection Dark Mondays which was about Sir Henry Morgan\u2019s sack of Panama in 1670. \u201cThe Maid on the Shore,\u201d it was titled. I told it primarily from the point of view of this spear-carrier, a fairly dense but good-hearted young man named John. He grew as a character\u2014as they will\u2014and the end of the story left some interesting possibilities for him. So I wrote Or Else My Lady Keeps the Key which picks up with John returning from Panama, swearing to give up piracy because it doesn\u2019t pay. First, though, he has to fulfill a promise made to a dying friend and deliver a letter to the friend\u2019s mistress. Things get complicated. The title comes from a popular song of that era, The World Turn\u2019d Upside Down.\n At some point in the writing of the first story, I had one of those revelatory moments when I could see John\u2019s entire life stretched out\u2014sort of a Pirate\u2019s Progress. So there will be other pirate stories about him, I guess. I did one for the forthcoming antho Fast Ships, Black Sails (forthcoming in the next year) called \u201cI Begyn as I Meane to Go On\u201d which would be the opening illustration, as it were, in the series. My own particular pirate continuum is set about a generation and a half before all the Good Pirate Stuff\u2014could have kicked myself when I realized I\u2019d have no chance to incorporate Blackbeard or the hilarious Stede Bonnet into the stories, because they hadn\u2019t even been born yet. So I can\u2019t really riff off any of the modern takes on pirate adventure, which are all set around 1720. It crimps one\u2019s style a little\u2014no cocked hats yet, and ships have tillers, not wheels\u2014but one has the consolation of being original.\n What are some of your favorite pirate novels or stories?\n Robert Louis Stevenson\u2019s Treasure Island of course. And I still have my dog-eared copy of Tim Powers\u2019 On Stranger Tides.\n You rarely enter into online discussions, as far as I know, and even had your message board deleted at one point. What is your relationship to the internet, and do you think this online element to our lives has helped the genre community as a whole or hurt it?\n The internet . . . nice place to visit, but I wouldn\u2019t want to live there. My relationship to it these days is primarily as a reference source\u2014Google Earth is great, Wikipedia OK if used with a big grain of salt and other sources used to fact-check. I did use to take part in online discussions, in the days when Asimov\u2019s scheduled them, but . . . message boards and online discussions are a lot like study hall or detention, where mostly people are shoving each other and giggling and passing notes with dirty limericks. And one kid in the room is a psycho, and one is a bully, and one is a pompous twit, and you\u2019re at the back of the room dodging spitballs and thinking \u201cJesus fucking Christ, I\u2019m fifty-five! I could be somewhere else. Why aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n I think it has harmed the genre community, personally. People are talking about writing, instead of writing. That\u2019s a bad sign . . .\n What do you read for pleasure? And what recently have you really enjoyed?\n When I get the time to read, I\u2019ll read anything Terry Pratchett writes. Ditto Peter S. Beagle and Ian McEwan. I like all the Dead White Males like Somerset Maugham, O. Henry, Kipling, Hammett, Chandler. The late George MacDonald Fraser and Patrick O\u2019Brien. And I absolutely adored \u201cThe New Moon\u2019s Arms\u201d by Nalo Hopkinson.\n What else do you have coming out in 2008 and what are you working on?\n I have a fantasy novel called The House of the Stag coming from Tor. I have the aforementioned Or Else My Lady Keeps the Key coming from Subterranean. I just finished a steampunk story for an anthology Nick Gevers is editing. And I\u2019m working on a novelization of the novella \u201cThe Empress of Mars,\u201d because there was a lot more story there than got told.\n Jeff VanderMeer is an award-winning writer with books published in over 20 countries.

What do you have to say about that?\u201d\n Trust a reporter to sour the beauty of my work, Daniel thought. \u201cI\u2019m not charging for their memories. I\u2019m charging for the reconstruction. Every one of my clients is special\u2014every food memory is unique, and it\u2019s my job to treat it like the treasure it is. This is not an easy feat but, as you have just testified, it\u2019s money well spent.\u201d\n The reporter laughed in embarrassed agreement as she nibbled on another prawn from the cocktail Daniel prepared according to her dearest memory, her first \u201cgrown up\u201d event: a wedding party when she was six years old. And all the while, Daniel sighed, waiting for the next obvious question. How many times had he explained himself? And yet, people thought the time-tracking machine worked on its own. It could only show what had happened at the moment the event plaited itself in the memory fabric, but once back to the present day, it was the raw talent in the kitchen that made or broke the day. But to talk about that was to spoil the magic.\n \u201cYou must have a favorite dish,\u201d the reporter insisted with a coy look. \u201cThe recipe only your mother could prepare. Would you be able to reproduce it?\u201d\n Saved by the bell\u2014or rather by the ringing of his mobile phone\u2014the name on the caller ID made Daniel blanch, and he stood up so fast the chair fell to the carpeted ground with a muted thump. \u201cPlease excuse me\u2014that\u2019s awkward\u2014an emergency,\u201d he said as he walked away, phone to the ear, shoulders down like a rugby fly half about to dash for the opponent\u2019s field. \u201cDenise, I\u2019m busy!\u201d\n \u201cAnd top o\u2019 the fucking morning to you too, sunshine! I\u2019ll be brief. Mum is on the last wish list.\u201d Daniel stopped walking. \u201cDan? You heard me? It\u2019s time for the last meal.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, what of it? The food reproducers at the hospital are great. I trained the staff myself. Why the fuck are you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t explain over the phone, just come up here!\u201d Denise sighed, and he saw her in the back of his mind, Denise with the wiry reddish hair and her freckles, pressing the middle of her forehead with two fingers and counting to ten, grounding herself or else she\u2019d bite his head off over the phone. \u201cPlease, just show up. Blame it on me, if you must.\u201d\n \u201cOh, you can count on that!\u201d Off went the phone. A deep breath, and then another, and another. He had to come to his senses, hoping the reporter hadn\u2019t heard the conversation. It wouldn\u2019t look good on the papers if he said he didn\u2019t have a childhood favorite recipe, or that he sometimes wished his mother would end her days the way she forced her children to go through their early days: dry toast and water from the tap, greasy food from tins and frozen pots. Why did Denise call him? She knew there was nothing he could do.\n The brutality of the memory made him shiver in fear, especially as he saw the reporter at the other end of the restaurant, nibbling on her prawn cocktail, oblivious to the shift going on inside the celebrity time-chef who brought that blissful remembrance to her life once had.\n II.\n There was the recipe card, yellowed with age, written with the meticulous calligraphy of those who couldn\u2019t waste an inch of space on the paper. Manjar dos Deuses, or the Gods\u2019 Pudding: a coconut flan served with a dried plum syrup. It was all the rage back in the day, an obvious choice for a supper party at home. Any woman of his mother\u2019s generation would have had it at least once, but the cold fact didn\u2019t quite match what he remembered of his mother. \u201cJust what memory did they unearth from her hair?\u201d\n \u201cThe time-cooks said they saw her picking the recipe from a neighbor and then writing it down.\u201d\n \u201cBut they didn\u2019t capture her preparing or eating the pudding.\u201d\n \u201cNo, but does it matter? That was the memory in her hair, Manjar dos Deuses with sugar syrup and prunes. This was the recipe I found in her stuff. This is her handwriting. All this work, and she didn\u2019t even eat it!\u201d\n \u201cDid you eat it?\u201d Daniel couldn\u2019t help asking.\n \u201cI hate coconut,\u201d Denise flinched. \u201cWhen it\u2019s my turn, I\u2019ll ask for my mother-in-law\u2019s baklava. That\u2019s proper food for the gods. Now, then . . . D\u2019you think the cooks could have messed this up?\u201d\n Don\u2019t tell her what you think, Daniel thought. No use hurting her, it won\u2019t fix anything. \u201cDunno, but it won\u2019t hurt me to check, since I\u2019m here . . . \u201d Denise sighed, relieved. Note to self: make her a tray of baklava when this is over.\n III.\n The hospice time-traveling device wasn\u2019t new, but it worked well enough. It could produce ten slots per week\u2014a fair number, considering the small clientele. \u201cWe don\u2019t need the big guns, like those weird museum machineries. We don\u2019t go too far in the past. Fifty, sixty years back, tops,\u201d said one time-cook. \u201cPeople like it simple. Mum\u2019s special porridge, grandma\u2019s pie, nothing fancy.\u201d\n It made sense: all a matter of perspective. His clients wanted what they had at their honeymoon or on a joyous holiday, stuff dripping with privilege and joy. The last wish brigade merely wanted comfort for the journey ahead.\n \u201cI saw her writing the recipe,\u201d the time-cook carried on. \u201cA different moment, to be sure, but we have that from time to time: two memories plaited in the same strand, referring to the same dish.\u201d\n \u201cHow old was she, then?\u201d\n \u201cTwelve, tops. School uniform, plaited hair . . . \u201d\n At the same age Daniel began to cook for himself, because Denise was out working at all hours and mother couldn\u2019t be bothered leaving her bed. And even when she did . . . The taste of dry toast still clogged the back of his throat. \u201cListen, lads, it wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Daniel added, banishing the foul taste away from his mind. \u201cI\u2019m sure you did your best. She\u2019s just a tough customer.\u201d\n \u201cI suppose she is, since she\u2019s used to the best in show!\u201d\n \u201cCould you show me the rest of the kitchen?\u201d Daniel forced a press-approved smile as the cooks gave him a tour of the facilities. Later, he\u2019d sign toques and books, and pose for pictures with the crew before wasting one of his own time-tracking credits on the hospital\u2019s equipment to see his mother writing the recipe for the manjar. His mother\u2014a malnourished, grubby little girl with lice in her reddish-brown hair, holding the black ballpen with the same difficulty she\u2019d have to hold cutlery later in life.\n She only had one card\u2014that was why she was writing so slowly. No room for mistakes. When she added the last word, she smiled in bright triumph\u2014and then, little by little, the smile faded into the blue grimace Daniel had been so accustomed to.\n When the \u201cbeep\u201d signaled the end of the session, he sighed with palpable relief upon seeing the white Formica and gray chrome empty kitchen through the glass door of the time-tracking equipment.\n The frown on his mother\u2019s childhood face wasn\u2019t displeasure. It was a sadness too deep to explore without proper instruments.\n IV.\n Daniel had expected worse for someone who was on the last wish roll. His mother looked well, given the circumstances\u2014sure, thinner and sallower, but with the usual penciled eyebrows over the same hooded eyes, the same Roman nose both he and Denise had inherited.\n \u201cOh, no, they called the big star!\u201d\n The same viper tongue, too. \u201cTop o\u2019 the morning to you too,\u201d Daniel replied through the press-approved smile, trying to figure out what to say next. \u201cHow are you?\u201d was a silly question and \u201cdid you miss me\u201d was useless. Denise steered the attention to the plate resting on the plastic tray. \u201cMama, mama, isn\u2019t this nice? Daniel prepared an heirloom recipe especially for you!\u201d\n \u201cFancy that! The celebrity chef made me a dish? Must be my lucky day.\u201d\n Daniel frowned as he looked at Denise, who had the decency to appear mortified. \u201cMama, won\u2019t you eat it? Daniel prepared it especially for you.\u201d\n \u201cWhere are the cameras? Did you hide the cameras? Am I going to be in one of your silly shows?\u201d When Daniel didn\u2019t rise to the bait, the old lady pierced the pudding with a plastic spoon twice and then turned to Denise. \u201cYou eat it. I\u2019m too much of a hillbilly to appreciate such finery.\u201d\n \u201cRemind me again why did I bother?\u201d Daniel turned to his sister. \u201cI wasted my personal credits to see the memory and . . . \u201d\n \u201cBlah, blah, blah! Why did you think I\u2019d eat your gourmet crap?\u201d His mother raised her voice. Again, Daniel closed his fists, waiting for the monster behind that sound. \u201cFancy crap to feed the bling-bling crowd, that\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t ask for this. I\u2019m not that ill to be given such mercies.\u201d\n \u201cThis crap,\u201d he picked up the plate, \u201cis far from refined!\u201d Daniel handed the plate to Denise. \u201cFind someone who likes coconut and give this to them. Don\u2019t bloody dare call me again unless it\u2019s an actual emergency.\u201d\n He left without looking back, the memories simmering and floating like fat atop a soup: bread and margarine for lunch if he was lucky; bouillon for dinner if things were well; the laughter of the other children when he ate a tomato the way one eats an apple because he was so hungry, so hungry. His mother refused to cook, refused to even look at the hob, leaving him and Denise to the care of others, leaving them to the care of the wind, forever famished. If someone would ever throw one lock of his hair into the time-traveling device, that\u2019s what they would find: a tomato eaten like an apple, and the laughter, the painful laughter that made him a chef: you\u2019ll see, the lot of you, I\u2019ll cook my way out of this hellhole, you\u2019ll choke on the morsels, just you wait.\n A tomato and the laughter: but they weren\u2019t as painful as the memory of his hunger.\n V.\n \u201cThere has to be some secret ingredient. Dunno, something extra or something missing, if you know what I mean. Please, Dan, you can\u2019t just give up!\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t give up. I went there, I saw the memory, and I cooked what I saw. She didn\u2019t want to eat it; she never wants to eat anything. Why are you insisting on this? I know all your friends\u2019 mothers had extravagant last dishes, but that\u2019s not in the cards for us.\u201d Denise pressed the center of her forehead. \u201cAnd stop doing that!\u201d Daniel snapped. \u201cYou look just like her when you do that.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you think I don\u2019t know that? I can\u2019t help it. You sound like her, don\u2019t you know.\u201d\n \u201cMore\u2019s the fucking pity.\u201d Daniel looked around his kitchen, all deserted after the night shift ended. The time-tracking device was put away for the night, but it still looked magnificent. It was a state-of-the-art machine that could run twenty slots per day. Not that he needed that much\u2014he didn\u2019t have that many clients\u2014but it was good to know he had extra voyages just in case he needed to research a memory further. \u201cJust humor me, did she eat the pudding in the end, or . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cAll of it,\u201d Denise sighed. \u201cShe almost licked the plate! But she kept insisting she didn\u2019t want it, that it wasn\u2019t what she wanted or what she remembered. Perhaps it was all in the way her mother prepared it? Or her grandmother, or some other relative?\u201d\n \u201cDenise, stop it. She probably invented a story herself. Think about it. Half a dozen eggs? Whole milk? Shredded coconut flakes? Denise, those things would have been expensive as heck for her family. Remember, rat poor, the lot of them\u2014we heard the stories one time too many. We can\u2019t go anywhere nice; we can\u2019t have anything nice because they were rat poor and God help you or me if we dared to want more!\u201d Again the laughter ringing in his ears, the tomato pulp running down his chin, and his mother excusing herself, saying her son was soft in the head, you understand, he got it after his father, bless him . . . And all the while, she wouldn\u2019t listen when he said he was hungry. Didn\u2019t I just feed you? You ask for too much. \u201cWhat do you get from this torture?\u201d\n \u201cPeace of mind, that\u2019s what.\u201d She didn\u2019t go on, because she didn\u2019t need to. Denise was and always would be the bigger person. She was the one that brought home the ingredients he asked for, at whatever cost; she was the first person he fed. For years, she was his only client and only companion, the one reason he kept learning, the one reason to wake up in the morning: I must make lunch for Denise, I must make dinner for Denise, she can\u2019t go to work hungry.\n \u201cI want to make her comfortable. That little girl in the memory . . . There must be something I can do. I know the manjar was special. Trust me, Dan, please: I know it is.\u201d\n \u201cFine, fine. But I\u2019d need another sample,\u201d he relented. \u201cCut a strand of her hair and bring it here within an hour, or you best forget it. The machine is excellent, but it has limits.\u201d\n And so do I, he wanted to add, and you are pushing them too much.\n VI.\n The following morning, moments before the restaurant crew arrived for work, Denise brought a strand of yellowish hair in a paper napkin. It wasn\u2019t the ideal way to carry a sample, but Daniel wouldn\u2019t say a word about it\u2014or else he\u2019d change his mind once more.\n He placed the hair in the acrylic box to the left of the machine, and then locked himself with Denise inside the square-meter-and-a-half green molded plastic traveling cabin. \u201cYou will stand as witness,\u201d he said when she tried to leave. \u201cIt was your idea. You will see how I work now.\u201d\n Denise tried to leave again, but Daniel pressed a button inside the cabin and everything around them lost color and smell; next thing she knew, she was lurching forward in the small cabin as the surroundings spun, while Daniel remained stable in his corner, a quiet smile on his lips and both feet planted on the chromed ground.\n The world outside melted, the modern kitchen became an off-white void that was tinged here and there with spots of verdigris and silver until, drip by drip, a new scenario emerged from the mixing colors.\n A concrete tenement hall, dingy gray, and smelling of rancid fat and petrol fumes, stood before the two siblings as Daniel opened the glass door. There: at the staircase, carrying an immense government-issued food parcel, his mother at twenty. No, hold it: that was his grandmother at twenty: his mother was at the door of their apartment, a five-year-old girl jumping up and down with the joy of those blessed with a miracle.\n Denise reached out to touch the little girl, but the memory flicked and almost disappeared. Daniel didn\u2019t bother telling her the rules of the machinery and didn\u2019t bother scolding her. Instead, he ran toward what passed for a kitchen in the bedsit: a camping stove, an ancient icebox, two pans, and two pots. The scene played on: his grandmother putting away the packets of rice, beans, and chickpeas, the sardine tins, and the ground coffee, and then holding a paper packet like a holy relic, a boon from the gods.\n Instant pudding.\n Daniel would laugh if only he could stop trembling.\n Instant pudding reinforced with powdered milk and corn flour to ensure the mixture would be thick enough to be like a true Manjar dos Deuses once unmounded. His grandmother cooked on her knees, while her daughter pestered her with all the great things they would eat now that they received their parcel, and how one day they\u2019d have a nice oven and a sink, just you wait, when Dad came back and the rumble outside was gone.\n The paltry war bundle, the soot on the bedsheets that did double duty as curtains, all horrified Denise. But Daniel only had eyes for the little black pot over the camping stove, to the care that his grandmother devoted to the ingredients, the way she quietly stirred everything, oblivious to her daughter and her dreams. The secret ingredient was a small bottle of coconut milk\u2014and after his grandmother emptied the contents of the pot, she filled it with water and shook it to remove even the most recalcitrant dreg.\n And his mother ate it all, still chatting about the days to come. Nothing better, nothing nicer in the world: her mother\u2019s manjar was the best thing in the world.\n He reconstructed the next years in his head. Soon, he figured out, that little girl would find out the Manjar dos Deuses her mother made to please her was a sham. She\u2019d go to school and her classmates would fill in the details and taunt her for her poverty, for the father lost in the rumble, for the lice in her hair. The desire soured, the anger turned into resignation, all inside a recipe card she kept for fifty years, untouched like a museum specimen. Food became fuel so not to be again the knife that her colleagues used to slash her.\n The same knife her son branded against her: her brightest enemy, sided with the riches and their glittery banquets that she could only glance at from the window.\n Instant pudding? Why would he eat that crap? He\u2019d make the real thing, and eat the real thing, and never be hungry again. He must have told her so, didn\u2019t he? Or some words to that effect. They were always shouting at each other, ravenous and angry, one feeling fueling the other.\n The scene blurred once more; the colors fading into green, into white, into black, and then reshaping themselves as Daniel\u2019s kitchen. Denise opened the door and retched on the floor in a fit of tears while her brother observed the scene with glazed eyes.\n There, he thought to himself: underneath the monster that shaped his entire life, a hungry five-year-old girl.\n VII.\n Daniel and Denise stared at a blue plastic bowl with the white, gelatinous mass faintly smelling of coconut and reconstituted powdered milk, proffered with no introductions or explanations. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to eat this crap, now, do you?\u201d their mother riled them out of habit, but the voice didn\u2019t stir up much that time\u2014Daniel kept his hands at his sides; Denise didn\u2019t touch her forehead.\n \u201cWhat is it with you two? You poisoned the food? That desperate to get rid of me, are you?\u201d Again, no answer, and she took a spoonful of the pudding. \u201cJesus, you two, always so bloody stuck-up. Here, I\u2019ll eat it, all right, star chef? If that makes your sister happy, I\u2019ll eat it.\u201d\n Something shifted when she ate the spoonful, and it led to another, and then another, and another until she was scraping the bowl, ravenous, desperate for more. And the more she ate, the more she stared at her son and her daughter, and in her eyes their faces were no longer distant and haughty, but human, too human, too close to her heart, too much like what she could have been if only, if only. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d turned into \u201cHow could you?\u201d and then into \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do this sooner?\u201d and \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d until it all dissolved into tears and stomachache. She\u2019d throw the bowl away; she\u2019d howl, she\u2019d try to cuss to make the pain go away\u2014she would if only she could only stop shaking, the longing catching up with her at last.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not like hers,\u201d she said at last, attempting to articulate the phrase in the composed, detached manner her children knew her for. \u201cBut thanks, I suppose. For the effort.\u201d\n \u201cLikewise, I suppose,\u201d Daniel replied with the same rehearsed tone, knowing only too well that this was the furthest she\u2019d dare to go to acknowledge it all. But when future historians combed through his hair for clues about his story, they\u2019d find that cheap pudding plaited in the strands, and the peace that came with it. It\u2019d have to be enough.\n Anna Martino is a Brazilian SFF writer and editor, publishing in English and Portuguese since 2013.

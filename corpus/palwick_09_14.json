He\u2019d called them with the bad news half an hour ago, so he was the last person Frank had expected to see outside the house.\n \u201cThe pass is closed,\u201d Dan said, his breath steaming through the open cab window. Late April, and it was that cold. There\u2019d been a hard frost overnight, even down here in Reno. The daffodils and tulips had just started to bloom, and now they were going to die. Damn freaky weather.\n Up higher, it was snow: Truckee and Donner Pass were socked in. Frank could see the weather even here, from the front yard of the tiny house he and Kerry had bought the summer she was pregnant with Alison. Their first house, and back then they\u2019d expected to move sometime, but they never had. It was a cozy house, just right for a couple.\n They\u2019d need cozy today. Frank could see the clouds blanketing the mountains to the west, I-80 crossing the California border twelve miles away. There might be snow left in those clouds when they got down to the valley. Frank hoped not. He didn\u2019t want to have to shovel the driveway. Losing everything bright in the backyard was bad enough.\n Kerry put down her side of the recycling bin, forcing Frank to put his down, too. All those empty wine bottles got heavy. \u201cNow, Dan,\u201d she said, as if she were scolding one of the dogs for chewing on the couch cushions. \u201cCome on now. It\u2019ll be open again in a few hours. It never stays closed very long.\u201d And that was true, but it could be open and still be nasty driving, dangerous, even if you weren\u2019t in a truck so old it should have been in a museum somewhere. Stretches of I-80 were still two lanes in either direction, twisty-turny, with winds that could blow a car off the road in a storm. Nobody tried to drive over the mountains in bad weather except the long-haul truckers with the really big rigs, and nobody with any sense wanted to jockey with them on a slick road.\n Dan had never had much sense. \u201cI don\u2019t have a few hours,\u201d he said. His hands were clenched on the steering wheel, and he sounded like he\u2019d already been hitting the beer, even though Frank couldn\u2019t smell anything: all that old anger rising up in a wave, the way booze makes it do. \u201cRosie could already be gone. This is it: hours, the doctors say.\u201d He\u2019d already said that on the phone, told them how Sandra\u2019s sister had only called him this morning, given him hardly any notice at all.\n \u201cThey know you\u2019ll get to talk to her later,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cYou have all the time in the world. It\u2019s wonderful, Dan. You\u2019re so lucky.\u201d Kerry\u2019s voice caught, the way it usually only did late at night when she\u2019d been working on the wine and typing nonsense on her laptop. Time to change the subject.\n \u201cAt least the ski resorts\u2019ll be happy,\u201d Frank said, thinking about what a dry winter it had been. Kerry gave him that look that meant, shut up, you fool, and he remembered that Dan\u2019s ex\u2014the latest one, number four or five\u2014had run off with a ski instructor. That was five years ago. There should be a statute of limitations about how long you had to avoid talking about things. Frank had enough trouble keeping track of his own life, let alone everyone else\u2019s too. Kerry was the opposite: couldn\u2019t remember what she did last night, not when she\u2019d been sitting up with the wine and the computer, but she never forgot anything that happened to anyone else, especially if it was tragic.\n \u201cDan,\u201d she said, \u201ccome inside and eat some breakfast with us. We\u2019ll listen to the radio, and as soon as the pass opens you can be on your way, all right? Come on. We\u2019ve got fresh coffee, and I\u2019ll make some eggs and bacon. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d\n \u201cI have to get over there,\u201d Dan said, and Kerry reached out and patted his arm through the window. \u201cI could\u2019ve driven over last night, a few days ago, I should\u2019ve, I knew it was bad but I didn\u2019t know she had so little time left, no one told me\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t have a place to stay,\u201d Kerry said gently. And he couldn\u2019t afford the time off work, but Frank wasn\u2019t going to say that. Dan worked in the dump north of town, taking old cars apart and putting them back together, and he only had that job because his boss took pity on him.\n \u201cCome on in,\u201d Frank said. \u201cNo sense starting out until the pass opens. You won\u2019t buy yourself any time if you head up now: you\u2019ll just have to sit it out somewhere higher. Do it with us over some hot coffee, Dan.\u201d If they let him go when he was this upset, he\u2019d head to a 7-11 for a sixpack sure enough, or to a bar, which would be even worse. The booze was another good reason for him not to be driving all the way to Sacramento in lousy weather, and also, Frank suspected, why neither his ex-wife number two or any of her people wanted to put him up, even if he was Rosie\u2019s father. He didn\u2019t need to be drinking now, and he didn\u2019t need to be spending his gas money, which God only knew how he\u2019d scrounged up to begin with, with a gallon costing what it did.\n Dan looked away, out the windshield, and cleared his throat. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be bothering you. Shouldn\u2019t even have called you before, or driven by here. Fact is, I feel awfully funny\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you mind that,\u201d Kerry said, a little too quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re happy for you, Dan, happy for you and Rosie. We couldn\u2019t be happier. It\u2019s a blessing, so don\u2019t you give it another thought. Come have some eggs.\u201d Her voice was wobbling again. Frank knew better than to say that he wasn\u2019t happy for Dan, that what was happening to Dan was no different at all from what had happened to Frank and Kerry. But maybe Dan knew that. Maybe that was why he\u2019d come by the house. He must have known it, or he wouldn\u2019t have been so worried about being late.\n So Dan followed them inside. He and Kerry sat at the kitchen table while Frank cooked. Usually Kerry cooked, because she was a lot better at it than Frank was, but he could do simple breakfast stuff fine, and Kerry was better at letting people cry at her. She liked to talk about sad stuff. Frank didn\u2019t.\n Dan poured his heart out while Frank fried up a bunch of eggs and bacon and the radio droned on about the storm. \u201cThat fucking asshole Sandra\u2019s married to now doesn\u2019t want me there at all. I\u2019m not sure Sandra does either, to tell you the truth. That\u2019s probably why her sister called; I always got on with her okay. Leah said she wanted me to know, like Sandra and the asshole didn\u2019t want me to know. I got the feeling they didn\u2019t even know she was calling me. Shit.\u201d\n \u201cRosie\u2019s your daughter,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cYou have a right to be there.\u201d\n Even with his back to the table, Frank could hear Dan gulping coffee. Outside, a few flakes of snow swirled down into the yard. Frank couldn\u2019t see the mountains at all. \u201cI know I do,\u201d Dan said. \u201cShe\u2019s out of it now. Don\u2019t respond to nobody, that\u2019s what Leah said. Said the hospice nurse doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s hung on this long. They hang on to wait for people, sometimes. To give them a chance to get there. That\u2019s why Leah called me.\u201d\n \u201cSo you can drive over,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cTell her it\u2019s all right to go. That\u2019s what we had to do with Alison. They tell you to say that. They tell you to tell them it\u2019s okay to leave, even when it\u2019s breaking your heart, because having them leave is the last thing you want.\u201d Her voice had gotten thick. \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky she\u2019ll be translated, Dan.\u201d\n When she said that, Frank was moving hot bacon from the frying pan to a bunch of paper towels, to drain the grease. But the pan was still hot enough to spit at him, and he got burned. \u201cDammit!\u201d he said, and heard two chairs scrape. When he turned around, Dan and Kerry were both staring at him. Dan looked worried; Kerry looked mad. \u201cI burned myself,\u201d Frank said. \u201cOn the grease. That\u2019s all. Bacon\u2019ll be ready in a minute. Eggs are ready now. Anybody want toast? We\u2019ve got more coffee.\u201d\n They knew there was more coffee. Frank knew he was talking too much, even if there was nothing more to his outburst than burning himself, and Kerry\u2019s eyes narrowed a little more, until he could tell she was ready to spit the way the grease had. \u201cWhat?\u201d he said, hoping they weren\u2019t about to have a fight in front of Dan. But when Kerry looked like that, there was no way around it except to plow right through whatever was eating at her.\n \u201cIt\u2019s real, Frank. Translation. You should be happy for Rosie. And for Dan.\u201d\n \u201cI burned myself on the grease, Kerry. That\u2019s all. And Dan doesn\u2019t need to listen to us fight about this.\u201d Frank looked at Dan. \u201cAnd no matter how real it is, somebody needing it at Rosie\u2019s age is nothing to be happy about.\u201d Dan nodded, and Kerry looked away, and Frank turned back to the food, feeling like maybe he\u2019d danced his way around the fight after all. But when he turned back towards the table, a platter of eggs in one hand and a plate of bacon in the other, Kerry had started to cry, which she normally did only really late at night. That was usually Frank\u2019s cue to go to bed, but he couldn\u2019t do that at eight in the morning.\n So he just stood there, holding the food and trying to hold his temper. After Alison died, they\u2019d heard all the numbers and clich\u00e9s. How many marriages break up after the death of a child. How you have to keep talking to each other to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. How losing a kid is so hard because it violates the order of nature: children are supposed to bury their parents, not the other way around. The counselors at the hospital told Kerry and Frank all of that; most of their friends didn\u2019t say anything. The counselors had warned them about that, too, how people avoid the subject.\n Which maybe was why Dan had come to them. He knew Kerry wouldn\u2019t avoid it, anyway. \u201cYou,\u201d she said, and she sounded drunk, even though it was only eight in the morning and she hadn\u2019t been drunk ten minutes ago. \u201cYou. You never. You never want to talk about it.\u201d\n \u201cI talk about Alison all the time,\u201d Frank told her, as gently as he could. He wanted to slam the food down and go into the backyard to cover the daffodils: they\u2019d just come up, but he could see snow starting to come down in earnest now. He had to stay here, though. Because of Dan. \u201cCome on, Ker. You know I talk about her. Remember yesterday? We were driving to the store and we saw that bright-pink Camaro, and I said, \u2018Alison would have loved that car.\u2019 And you said that yeah, she would have. Remember? It was only yesterday.\u201d\n \u201cTranslation,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never want to talk about translation.\u201d\n Frank\u2019s wrists were starting to ache. He put the plates down on the table. \u201cWe should eat this stuff before it gets cold.\u201d But Kerry\u2019s chin was quivering. She wasn\u2019t going to let him change the subject. \u201cKer, we should maybe talk about this when Dan isn\u2019t here. Okay?\u201d What in the world was she thinking? She knew damn well how Frank felt, and he knew how she felt, which was exactly why they didn\u2019t talk about it. There was no point. It would only upset both of them.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Dan said. \u201cIt is. Really. I\u2014 I know people feel different ways about it. I don\u2019t know how I feel yet. I\u2019ll have to wait and see. I won\u2019t have an opinion until I\u2019ve talked to her. Until she\u2019s online. Then I can see if it really sounds like her.\u201d\n \u201cIt will,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cIt will, I go to the translation boards all the time and read about people who\u2019ve been talking to their dead, and they all say the messages are real, they have to be, because they say things no one else could know. Just yesterday there was a guy who heard from his dad and his dad told him to look in a certain box in the attic, and\u2014\u201d\n Ouija boards. People had been talking to imaginary ghosts as long as there were people. Now they did it with computers, was all. Frank wondered if Kerry would still have been so obsessed with translation if it had come around in time for Alison, if she hadn\u2019t died six months before the first dead person went online, not that they\u2019d have been able to afford it anyway.\n There was nothing to do but tune her out, the way he always did. He turned up the volume on the Weather Channel. \u201cFrank,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cYou\u2019re interrupting.\u201d\n \u201cListen,\u201d Frank said. It was easing off a little, the radio said. The highway might open again within an hour. And right then he decided. \u201cEat up, Dan. I\u2019m driving you. My truck\u2019s better than yours, and you shouldn\u2019t drive when you\u2019re upset, especially in tricky weather.\u201d\n Frank felt rather than saw Kerry shaking her head. \u201cNo. It\u2019s dangerous up there!\u201d Her voice bubbled with panic. \u201cEven if the road opens again, it\u2019s safer to stay down here. Dan, you\u2019ve got your phone. She\u2019ll call you.\u201d\n \u201cI have to try to see her,\u201d Dan said. \u201cI have to. You understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n Kerry shook her head again. \u201cFrank, no. I don\u2019t want you driving up there. I can\u2019t lose you, too.\u201d But she knew him; she could read him. She\u2019d started crying again, but she said, \u201cI\u2019ll fix a thermos of coffee.\u201d\n The snow got thicker as they climbed, and the sparse traffic slowed and then finally stopped a few miles short of the first Truckee exit. Dan, sitting with his hands clenched on his knees, had said quietly, \u201cHey, thanks,\u201d when they got into the truck, and Frank had nodded, and they hadn\u2019t said anything else. The only voice in the truck was the droning National Weather Service guy talking about the storm. It was peaceful, after Kerry\u2019s yammering.\n Frank had been driving very slowly. He trusted himself and his truck, which had a full tank of gas and new snow tires and could have gotten through just about anything short of an avalanche, but he didn\u2019t trust the other idiots on the road. When they had to stop, he unscrewed the thermos of coffee and poured himself a cup. \u201cYou want some?\u201d\n Dan shook his head. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d He stared straight ahead, peering through the windshield as if he could see all the way to Sacramento. There was nothing to look at but snow. Normally they would have had a gorgeous view of the mountains all around them and the Truckee River to their left, real picture postcard stuff, but not today.\n Frank saw somebody bundled in a parka trudging between the lanes, knocking on windows. \u201cThis can\u2019t be good,\u201d he said.\n \u201cDamn fool will get killed when things start moving.\u201d\n But it was a cop. They didn\u2019t take chances. Frank rolled down his window, and bitter stinging snow blew into the cab. \u201cMorning, officer.\u201d\n It was a woman, CHP. \u201cThere\u2019s a spinout up there. Bad ice. Road\u2019s closed again, will be for a while. We\u2019re advising everyone to take the shoulder to the next exit and turn around.\u201d Sure enough, Frank saw the SUV ahead of them pulling onto the shoulder.\n Dan groaned, and Frank shook his head. \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am, but we have to stay on the road. We wouldn\u2019t be out here otherwise.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, then, but I hope you\u2019re okay with sitting for a while.\u201d\n Frank closed the window again and cranked up the heater a little more. \u201cDon\u2019t burn up all your gas,\u201d Dan said.\n \u201cI\u2019ll get more when we\u2019re moving again.\u201d\n Dan shook his head. \u201cSnow in April.\u201d But the mountains got snow in April every year, at least one big storm. Reno natives still talked about the year there\u2019d been snow on July 4. At altitude, there was no such thing as predictable weather.\n Frank shifted in his seat; one ass cheek was already going numb. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want some coffee?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure! My nerves are bad enough as it is.\u201d Dan sounded angry, and Frank swallowed his own anger and didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m doing you a favor, dammit. He was tired of getting snapped at because other people couldn\u2019t deal with reality. But he was doing himself a favor too, using Dan\u2019s situation to get away from Kerry. Maybe he had it coming.\n So they sat there, staring out at the snow, and finally Dan said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was short with you. I\u2014\u201d\n \u201cForget it,\u201d Frank said. \u201cHow about some music?\u201d\n \u201cWhatever you want,\u201d Dan said, in that tone that meant I don\u2019t really want this but I owe you so I\u2019ll put up with it. Frank reached into the back for the box of CDs\u2014old reliable tech\u2014and riffled through it. The Beatles sang about missing people too much, and the Doors were too weird and depressing, the last thing Dan needed now. Finally Frank picked out Best of the Big Bands. That ought to be innocuous enough.\n They were staring out at the swirling snow and listening to the Andrews Sisters singing \u201cThe Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B\u201d when Dan\u2019s cellphone rang. Dan groaned, and Frank turned off the music. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just Leah giving you an update,\u201d he said. \u201cOr a telemarketer.\u201d But he didn\u2019t believe that himself, and he saw Dan\u2019s hands shaking as they fumbled with the phone. He heard Dan\u2019s hoarse breathing, the hiss of snow on the windshield, the shrilling phone.\n And then silence as Dan answered. \u201cYes? Hello?\u201d\n There was a long pause. In the bleak light from the storm, Frank saw Dan\u2019s face grow slack and stricken. Frank had never met Rosie, but knowing that she must be dead, he felt the same sucker-punch to the gut he\u2019d felt when Alison died, that moment of numbness when the world stopped.\n \u201cBaby?\u201d Dan said. \u201cRosie? Is that really you?\u201d\n No, Frank thought. No, it\u2019s not. Goddammit\u2014\n \u201cRosie, are you okay now? I\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t get there in time. I wanted to say goodbye. I\u2019m so sorry. I tried. We\u2019re on the road. We\u2019re stuck in snow.\u201d He was sobbing now in great heaving gasps.\n Frank looked away from him. The voice on the other end would be saying that it was okay, that everything was forgiven. Kerry told him those syrupy stories all the time, the miracles of posthumous reconciliation people had always paid big money for. The price tag had gone up, but at least Dan wasn\u2019t paying for it. Sandra and the asshole were the suckers there.\n Dan fell into silence, chin quivering, and then said, \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Frank saw him shudder. \u201cI\u2019m here now. I\u2019m here. You can always call me. I love you. I\u2019m sorry you hurt so much at the end. Yes, call your friends now. I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d\n He hung up, fumbling almost as much as he had when he answered the phone, his hands shaking as if he were outside in the cold, not here in the truck with a hot thermos of coffee and the heater blasting. He cleared his throat. \u201cI told her I was sorry I wasn\u2019t there. She said, \u2018Daddy, you\u2019ve never been there.\u2019\u201d His voice cracked. Frank stared straight ahead, out into the snow. Jesus.\n Next to him, he heard Dan unscrewing the thermos, heard the sound of the liquid pouring into the cup. \u201cI deserved that.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice was quiet, remote. \u201cWhat she said.\u201d\n Frank shifted in his seat again. He had a sudden sharp memory of yelling at Alison when she was a little thing, three or four, when she\u2019d been racing around the house and had run into him and her Barbie doll had jammed into his stomach like a bayonet. He\u2019d had a bruise for two weeks, but the memory of her face when he screamed at her had lasted a lot longer. He swallowed. \u201cDo they get over things? Or are they stuck like that forever, mad at whatever they were mad at when they died?\u201d That had to be anybody\u2019s idea of hell.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Dan\u2019s words were thin, frayed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can make it up to her now, except by talking to her whenever she wants to talk. I can\u2019t go back and get to her seventh birthday party, that time I was out drinking. I can\u2019t go back and fight less with Sandra. I just\u2014well, I can tell Rosie how sorry I am about all of that. Hope she knows I mean it.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. What do you want to do now, Dan? I\u2019ll still drive you to Sacramento, if you need to see\u2014\u201d\n \u201cHer dead body? No.\u201d Dan shook his head, a slow heavy movement like a bear shaking off the weight of winter. \u201cNot in this stuff. You\u2019ve been awfully kind. I\u2019ll try to get to the funeral, but that won\u2019t be for a few days, anyway. The highway ought to be open by then.\u201d His voice splintered again. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d gotten to hug her one last time, you know?\u201d\n Frank nodded, and eased the truck carefully onto the shoulder, and headed for the exit.\n It didn\u2019t take long to get back to the house. Frank pulled into the driveway, and they both got out, and Dan said, \u201cI\u2019ll be heading home now. You go on in and tell Kerry what happened. I\u2019m not up to it.\u201d\n \u201cIf you need anything\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll let you know. Thanks, Frank.\u201d Dan nodded and headed back to his own truck, and Frank went into the house. Kerry, sitting at the kitchen table doing a crossword puzzle, looked up when he came through the door. He saw the relief on her face, saw her exhale. And then she frowned.\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n \u201cThe highway\u2019s still closed. Rosie\u2019s dead. She called Dan.\u201d He pulled out another chair and sat down, suddenly exhausted. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Kerry. It\u2019s real.\u201d\n Her eyes filled with tears. She reached for his hand. \u201cI\u2019m glad you know that now.\u201d\n He did know, but he knew other things, too. He knew that it didn\u2019t make any difference, that even if your dead child called you from cyberspace, you still regretted what you hadn\u2019t been able to do for her. He wouldn\u2019t miss Alison any less if she\u2019d been translated, not even if she\u2019d been one of the syrupy ghosts. Maybe he\u2019d miss her more.\n But that wasn\u2019t anything he could say to Kerry, who needed whatever comfort she could get. So he stood up and went to the window. There were icicles hanging from the roof. The daffodils and tulips definitely weren\u2019t going to make it.\n He heard Kerry\u2019s chair scraping against the linoleum, felt her come up behind him. \u201cHoney, there will be flowers again next year.\u201d\n \u201cI know there will.\u201d\n He stood there, looking out, remembering the day they\u2019d planted the bulbs, mixing the soil with Alison\u2019s ashes. She\u2019d loved flowers.\n Susan Palwick is an Associate Professor of English at the University of Nevada, Reno.

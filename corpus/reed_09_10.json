Inside the station, everybody smiles. Optimism is the natural state of mind. But this particular smile is larger and brighter than usual, and it happens to be honest. The man grins at me while taking a slow and very deep breath, trying to infect me with his prurient joy. He has news, important enormous delightful news, and he relishes the chance to tell me what I can\u2019t possibly know yet.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cOrlando,\u201d he says.\nI don\u2019t respond.\n\u201cThat boy,\u201d he says. \u201cThe brat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat has Orlando done?\u201d\n\u201cThis time, he\u2019s hurt a child.\u201d\nSurprise fills my face. My enduring smile is replaced with a concerned, suspicious grin. \u201cWhich child?\u201d\n\u201cHis sister.\u201d\nCompassion twists my features. \u201cHow badly?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cShe\u2019s bleeding.\u201d\nI start to pick up my doctor\u2019s case.\n\u201cJust a bad bloody nose. She\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d He doesn\u2019t want me rushing off. The girl isn\u2019t half as important as Orlando.\n\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d\n\u201cA few minutes ago.\u201d\n\u201cHe struck her?\u201d\n\u201cPunched her with his fist.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw this?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWho were the witnesses?\u201d I start to ask.\nBut he interrupts, explaining, \u201cThey were together in their quarters. Nobody else. Then there was a scream, and she was bleeding and crying. Several people saw her running into the hallway, holding her nose.\u201d\nI pick up the case anyway.\n\u201cShe says he hit her. She says her brother is mean.\u201d\nOrlando has a well-earned reputation. But stealing and lying are lesser crimes compared to physical violence, particularly violence towards a small and very pretty three-year-old girl.\n\u201cWhat do the parents say?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cNot very much. You can imagine.\u201d In the small, intense politics of the station, this is an important man. But he looks at me warily, wondering if I will do what is obvious to him.\n\u201cI will talk to them,\u201d I say.\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nMy clinic is a large room with three interior walls and a tall ceiling. The walls are padded, cutting the roar of blowing fans and aging machinery and the endless music of voices engaged in happy conversation. But when I step through the door, a strange, almost unheard-of quiet takes hold. Dozens of faces watch me, and nobody speaks. The black case rides in my most human hand, and I walk quickly, passing one old lady who turns to a grandchild, saying the word that everyone wants to hear.\n\u201cCull,\u201d she says.\nI stop and look back at her.\nMy expression makes her flinch. But she attempts to straighten her back\u2014impossible with her collapsing bones\u2014and with that fearless certainty of creatures not long for this world, she says, \u201cOh, but you\u2019ll have to cull the brat now. That\u2019s the law. You haven\u2019t any choice.\u201d\nA four-year-old stole the playmate\u2019s favorite toy, and everybody assumed a case of boys being boys. No need for alarm, no need to forgive. And when he was seven and tricked that little girl out of her morning rations, it was easy to believe that one stern lecture from his otherwise sterling parents would do enough good. But lectures never helped, except to teach the troublemaker that he didn\u2019t need the approval of others, and even when children avoided him, nothing changed. He was a loner, an outcast in the making. And more disturbing was how the adults would speak in front of him, talking openly about eradicating what was wrong with the world, and Orlando\u2019s only response was to erupt into wild, mocking laughter.\nHis parents worried but for somewhat different reasons.\nThe mother was quick to blame herself. If she was the problem, then she could be the solution too. \u201cI love Orlando,\u201d she would say, trying to convince herself of her motherly adorations. \u201cI just need to show my love more. Then I\u2019ll make him understand. I will. He can\u2019t keep acting this way. He can\u2019t steal and lie. This won\u2019t end well, if he doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\nThe father embraced several myths. Other children were the problem, gullible and silly, and they might even deserve what they got. Or his boy was testing boundaries, mastering his environment. But was either story good enough? If they didn\u2019t convince, there was one final, best hope: He looked at me, adding winks to his smile. \u201cOrlando\u2019s a genius,\u201d he claimed. \u201cThat\u2019s the heart of our problem. Look at his test scores. Look what the teachers write. Humans and machines say the same thing: He\u2019s practically exploding with promise.\u201d\nBut there was more than test scores to consider. Observations and gut feelings from his teachers belied every exceptional mark. Orlando\u2019s real genius was for making trouble. And it wasn\u2019t just the larceny and mendacity. That boy could pick the best possible moment to say the worst possible words\u2014flat alarming and awful statements crafted to test everybody\u2019s happiness.\nWhen he was eleven, Orlando leaped onto the cafeteria table, begging to be noticed. Most of the time he ignored other people, but on that day he drank in the nervous energies, waving arms while launching into a brief, polished speech about how there wasn\u2019t enough food in the station. Starvation was everyone\u2019s destiny. Except for the children whose parents were going to slit their throats and drink their thin blood and then fry up their scrawny little bodies. Those babies were the lucky ones, spared by the coming nightmares.\nDhaka is the mother. Nearly as pretty as her son, she held her baby daughter in her lap, shaking her head sadly. \u201cI have no idea why he would say that. Where would that come from?\u201d\nThe father tried to laugh. \u201cIt was a stupid joke. That\u2019s all. We aren\u2019t starving, not to death certainly, and the boy knows it. He\u2019s just rattling cages.\u201d\nDhaka dipped her head and sighed.\nHouston is the father, and he can be tenacious when it comes to denying the obvious. \u201cThe boy is bored. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cHow can Orlando be bored?\u201d Dhaka asked. \u201cThe station was designed with children in mind. We\u2019ve got the playground and an exercise yard. Every book ever written is waiting to be read, and he can play any game, and his AI teachers are always awake and ready to work with him. Or they could just talk to him. Even if he never plays with another child, he can keep very, very busy.\u201d\nThe playground was shabby, and the exercise yard smelled of puke. And to keep people from dwelling too much on negative influences, a large portion of the digital library was misfiled, leaving it unavailable to ordinary citizens.\nBut Houston wanted to echo the praise. \u201cNo, the station is great. It is.\u201d He straightened his back, giving his best effort at conviction. \u201cHell, this is the perfect life. For kids and for adults too.\u201d\nThe station was a shit hole, but I tried keeping the focus on one difficult boy. \u201cBelieve what you wish,\u201d I told them. \u201cBut Orlando is a disruption. And worse, he can be an agent of despair.\u201d\n\u201cThis is crap,\u201d declared Houston.\nWith a doctor\u2019s smooth, sorry voice, I said, \u201cChronic self-centeredness. If you want to give his affliction a name, that\u2019s it.\u201d\nDhaka sobbed and held her baby until the poor girl squirmed, and looking up asked the clinic\u2019s ceiling, \u201cWhat else can I do? Tell me, and I\u2019ll help him. Whatever it takes.\u201d\nI pretended to think, but my ideas were uniformly grim.\nOnce again, Houston denied the problem. But he wasn\u2019t quite as determined, and it was easy to see him achieving a truce with the possibilities. He wouldn\u2019t agree to any diagnosis, but it was important to ask, \u201cWhat about medicine?\u201d\n\u201cWhich medicines would you suggest?\u201d\nDhaka felt at ease with the topic. \u201cTranquilizers,\u201d she blurted.\nA sedated boy couldn\u2019t cheat or make people\u2019s faces red. But he couldn\u2019t be a productive citizen, not within this tiny, tightly orchestrated community.\n\u201cHow about harder stuff?\u201d Houston asked.\nI leaned forward, staring at his eyes. \u201cYou must believe me. Sir. There are no drugs to treat this affliction or shots to make the brain immune to these impulses. And even if there were chemical tricks, the molecules would be complicated and I\u2019d have to pull one of my synthesizers off its critical jobs, which as I\u2019m sure you understand would be an enormous burden on every other patient.\u201d\nThe parents sat back, blinking nervously. \u201cIf only this, if only that,\u201d they were thinking to themselves.\nIt was Houston who finally spoke. \u201cWhat are we talking about? If Orlando doesn\u2019t improve, I mean.\u201d\nTwo smart, scared adults watched me. I could offer a variety of appealing lies, but they wouldn\u2019t help anybody. The station was ruled by happiness, so deeply engrained that only the doctor sees its pernicious effects. If I wasn\u2019t blunt\u2014if I diluted my words or my tone\u2014these clever, joyous people were going to invent some ridiculous excuse not to believe me.\n\u201cThis is your official warning,\u201d I began.\nTerror spoiled those beaming, optimistic faces. They didn\u2019t want the word \u201ccull.\u201d Even the happiest soul would be crushed to hear that term linked to his oldest child. But then the baby decided she was famished, shattering the drama with her own self-possessed wailing. I decided not to say the word. Not yet. Dhaka held her daughter to her breast, and the two-time father smiled gamely, shaking his head while proudly admiring this perfect little angel that was his.\nNot that a doctor can read thoughts, of course. But in so many ways, human beings are more transparent than glass.\nEvery station must have its doctor.\nThe first doctor was a collection of wetware and delicate machinery designed to serve deep-space astronauts. He was built because human doctors were too expensive, doing little most of the time while demanding space and oxygen and food. The modern doctor was essential because three Martian missions had failed, proving that no amount of training and pills could keep the best astronaut sane, much less happy. My ancestor knew all of tricks expected of an honorable physician: He could sew up a knife wound, prescribe an antipsychotic, and pluck the radiation-induced cancer out of pilot\u2019s brain. But his most vital skill came from smart fingers implanted in every heroic brain\u2014little slivers armed with sensors and electricity. A doctor can synthesize medicines, but more important is the cultivation of happiness and positive attitudes essential to every astronaut\u2019s day.\nI am the same machine, tweaked and improved a thousand ways but deeply tied to the men and women who first walked on Mars.\nAnd this station can be regarded as a spaceship, overcrowded and stinking, every passenger facing demands on his patience and courage and simple human decency\u2014one hundred and seventeen humans making a voyage that has already gone on too long, with no end in sight.\nToday, almost everybody is bubbling with joy.\nCarrying the ceremonial bag, I walk into the east hallway and past three open doors where people stand watch. I am expected. This is a huge moment in the hallway\u2019s history, and nobody wants to miss it. My smile is polite. I say nothing, and my silence feels like dignity. There are some children, and they want to follow, but old hands grab and quiet voices say, \u201cNo.\u201d Somebody sniffs back a tear or two. I look at the readouts, spotting the weeper among the closest signals. Add a little current to that mind, and the sorrow fades away.\nHouston and Dhaka have shut their door. Every mood reaches out to me, except for the little girl\u2019s: She won\u2019t receive implants until her fifth birthday. If I act too soon, the surgery might fail in subtle ways.\nNo station door has a lock, but I knock politely, waiting a moment before coaxing them with their names. I guess that Houston will answer, and I am wrong. Orlando pushes the door into the hallway, showing off a broad beaming grin. He is irrepressibly happy, but never in the usual ways. I learned this long ago. The feel of his mind is different, and I don\u2019t entirely understand why. But if emotions were colors, his color would always be darker and hotter than anyone else\u2019s\u2014like a wicked purple with the power to burn.\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say.\nDhaka sits with her daughter, a bloodied rag pressed against the sore nose. The other hand is stuck into the woman\u2019s mouth, enduring the slow chewing of nervous teeth. Dhaka is sad. In her life, she has never felt this sorry and helpless. That\u2019s why I aim a feeble current through her mind, and for no reason she can name, that black despair weakens slightly.\nHouston is a worse threat. He decides to push between the boy and me, the shredded smile turning into a wicked grimace. He wants to hit. Free his impulses, and he would batter me with his fists, breaking fingers before the pain was too much. But that would mean a second culling. Besides, the enforced happiness keeps him rational enough to recognize the real source of this disaster. One hand and then other make fists, and he looks at Orlando with a begging expression, trying to find some route by which he can punish his child and not suffer the same fate.\n\u201cSir,\u201d I say. \u201cPlease, let me into your home.\u201d\nDirty bunks and dirty clothes and a few lucky toys and little artifacts fill up the ugly little space. The poorest caveman in the darkest days of humanity would have had better quarters. Yet despite these miserable surroundings, this is where these people feel most comfortable.\nOnce more, I say, \u201cSir.\u201d\nHouston\u2019s hands open. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\nI look at his children.\n\u201cI want to see,\u201d I say.\nWhat do I want to see? The parents glance at each other, not understanding.\n\u201cYour daughter,\u201d I say. \u201cShe bumped her nose, I heard.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Dhaka says.\nHouston nods. \u201cBumped it, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cAccidents happen.\u201d That\u2019s a useful clich\u00e9, and my personal favorite. I move past Houston while lowering myself. My face and the little girl\u2019s face are at the same level. The bleeding is finished, and it never was bad. She sniffs to prove that she can breathe, and when I smile, her smile turns more genuine. She is suspicious, but she wants to believe that she can go back to her day.\n\u201cYou bumped this, did you?\u201d\nShe nods.\n\u201cDid Orlando hit you?\u201d\nShe hesitates and then shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut others saw him hit you,\u201d I say. \u201cJust outside, in the hallway. He hit you with his foot.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the girl says, finding the flaws in that tale. \u201cIn the house here. With his hand.\u201d\nHer parents nearly melt.\n\u201cLeave us,\u201d I say. Then I make myself tall, my face above every head. \u201cDhaka. Houston. Take your daughter out of here.\u201d\nGiggling, Orlando asks, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\nI watch the adults. I watch him. Then it is just the two of us inside that filthy little room, and I put down my satchel and grab the boy by the head, squeezing hard enough that his eyes bug out.\n\u201cShut the door,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cShut it now.\u201d\nThere was a thirty-year window where humans touched Mars and the asteroids and flew bracingly close to Venus and Mercury. Every successful mission had its doctor, and after serving the expedition to Vesta\u2014the final deep-space mission\u2014my lineage was put to work on the increasingly fragile earth. That\u2019s when the earliest stations were being built: Huge complexes of sealed buildings and greenhouses and solar farms, recycling systems proved in space reclaiming water and trash. But instead of caring for small crews of highly trained specialists, the new doctors were called on to culture optimism in tens of thousands of ill-prepared citizens. Perhaps this is why each of those giant stations failed. Too many bodies meant too many variables. Inadequate planning and political turmoil proved to be decisive enemies. In the end, what survived were the small-scale, isolated stations. Purity and New Beginnings and The Three Cycles of Charm were burnt out shells, but a thousand obscure, nameless hamlets like mine passed into the next century, and then the next.\nI am the last kind of doctor: A mock-human machine built to mimic the warmest, most trusted elements of caregivers, but with skills and codes recognizing what is best for my patient.\nMy patient is the station and the parts of its precious body.\nThis is what I am thinking when the boy smiles at his own hands. Only when he bolsters his courage with some dangerous thought can he look at me. Orlando is healthier than most fourteen year-olds\u2014taller and stronger than one would expect, knowing his genetics and the daily ration. These are the blessings of being a gifted scavenger and thief. Through most of human history, that handsome, well-fed exterior would serve him well. But everybody knows his face already. That face smiles at me, and his mouth narrows, and he says, \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d\nA man\u2019s voice is beginning to emerge, and his shoulders promise an easy, increasingly dangerous strength.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t worry me,\u201d he says, sounding perfectly honest. \u201cSend me out of here. Cull me. I\u2019ll just find a better place to live.\u201d\nThere is no smile on my face. \u201cDo you remember the last cull?\u201d\n\u201cOld Syd. He got senile, started hitting people.\u201d\n\u201cYou were seven,\u201d I say.\nHe nods, delight brightening the brown eyes. \u201cYou took him out the door and over the lake and left him there. The rats caught him, I heard. A day or two later, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIt was best,\u201d I say.\nAnd the boy agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of days outside,\u201d he says. \u201cI know the surface. I know how to survive. Terror tactics don\u2019t work if your target refuses to be scared.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have another advantage,\u201d I say. \u201cYour survival kit is packed and waiting for you.\u201d\nJust slightly, Orlando flinches. Then with a skill that can only impress, he lies. He says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cTwo bags are buried in the lake. One has dried food, the other tools and the tarp that have gone missing in the last year.\u201d\nHe says nothing, watching my eyes.\n\u201cNo one else knows,\u201d I tell him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he says, the lie barely registering in his pulse and his breathing.\n\u201cThe kit doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I say. \u201cThose thefts are old news.\u201d\nHe says nothing.\nI push my face close. \u201cNobody can hear us, Orlando.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d he asks, holding his ground.\n\u201cI know where everybody is,\u201d I explain. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ambient noise, and I know exactly how deaf your parents are. Yes, they are standing in the hallway, on the other side of this door. But they\u2019re scared and very sad, and they don\u2019t want to hear what I am telling you. So they aren\u2019t listening. They\u2019ve never been so sick with worry, and that\u2019s why I can tell you this, Orlando.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d\n\u201cI have a confession. Since you are a smart boy . . . a genius, if the truth is told . . . you might have suspected this already: My critical job as Doctor is to chemically feed happiness into every citizen in this station.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYour fifth-year inoculations contained pseudo-worms and assorted chemosynthetic platforms. One injection leaves the brain laced with my agents, my most talented fingers.\u201d\nThis is an official secret, and Orlando is being invited into the knowing circle. He recognizes the importance of the moment. Relaxing, he breathes and drops his shoulders, his pleasure matching that very smug grin.\n\u201cI knew it,\u201d he says.\nMaybe that is a lie, maybe not. I don\u2019t need to look.\n\u201cThis place is a stinking dump,\u201d he says. \u201cBut everybody walks around singing. How crazy is that?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t feel that way,\u201d I say.\n\u201cNot most of the time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you know why?\u201d\nHe blinks. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t kept you happy like the others,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is intentional. It has been my strategy for years. You are sane and sober while the others are neither, and I knew conflicts would arise. Some incident. Some excuse. This is a day both of us saw coming, and that\u2019s why you stole those supplies, and that\u2019s why I allowed it.\u201d\nThe boy has never been happier.\n\u201cBut you are mistaken too,\u201d I add. \u201cMarching alone across the world? No, that isn\u2019t your fate, Orlando. You must believe me.\u201d\nHe wants to believe. \u201cWhat happens to me?\u201d he whispers.\n\u201cPut on your outdoor clothes, please. Now. We need to walk past the lake and meet the others.\u201d\n\u201cOthers?\u201d\n\u201cDress while I explain,\u201d I say.\nThe boy listens and dresses, and then he cannot move any longer. My answer takes him by surprise. I have never seen such a broad honest smile. One boot is on and untied, the other in his hands, and he is so happy that he cries, and that\u2019s when my human hand reaches, one of those tears feeling my touch, slipping off the eye and the lash to form a perfect bead resting lightly on my least useful finger.\nPeople fill the hallway, waiting. And everyone sees what he needs to see. The cool clean agent of decency takes the lead, quietly begging the others to step away, to leave them room. Behind the doctor walks the criminal, the scourge. Nothing about Orlando appears worried. He struts and flashes his grin, even when his parents fall in behind him. Dhaka sobs and moans and wraps her arms around her panting chest. Houston takes responsibility for the daughter, holding the little hand while staring at his son\u2019s erect back, his face pinched and pained but the remnants of a thirty-year smile refusing to melt away.\nOur audience follows us into the public plaza\u2014a space of high ceilings and vibrant colors, the black rubber floor wearing to pieces in the high-traffic areas. More people wait there. The station\u2019s entire population gathers, including three citizens that should be in bed. Everybody needs to see Orlando one last time, and he loves the attention. He shows them a cocky, smug creature, which is best. Which is my intention. Nobody is going to feel sorry for him. Nobody will ever miss him. This ridiculous image is what they will remember\u2014a crazed man-child being led to his demise\u2014and nobody will ache for what has been lost.\nThe station\u2019s inner door stands open. Orlando passes me at the end, grabbing the filter mask and goggles from the peg wearing his name. But he doesn\u2019t put them on. He has to look back at the others, throwing out one mocking laugh. Then his mother grabs him, and he endures her smothering hug while winking at his angry, sorrowful father.\nHe says to Houston, \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n\u201cCome,\u201d I say.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d the boy says.\nHouston drops his eyes, saying nothing.\nI pull the mask from Orlando\u2019s hands, placing it over his careless mouth. But then he kneels, putting his face in front of his sister. Touching the nose and a last bit of dried blood, he tells that scared little girl, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re better already. And be happy. Now you get three more bites every day.\u201d\nShe backs away, panicked.\nHe stands and puts on the goggles, and after adjusting the straps until comfortable, he calls out to everybody, \u201cWhat\u2019s the delay? Let\u2019s get this chore done.\u201d\n\u201cVesta,\u201d he says.\nThere is one light. Mine. I spread the beam, giving us a good view of the path leading down to the lake. It is January and dark. My light hides whatever stars might be showing through the dust and clouds that cling to these mountains. It is a rare night, the air chilly enough to make breath visible. Orlando pulls the work gloves from his pocket, trying to keep his fingers warm. Then he repeats that magical word. \u201cVesta,\u201d he says, turning and looking into the light. \u201cTell me again.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an asteroid.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cBut the mission was unique,\u201d I say. \u201cA secret fleet of spacecraft was sent there along with the small official mission. There was a lot of cargo, and the one ship returned for no reason except to fool people. Their plan was to convince the world that the little world had been touched and then abandoned. That\u2019s what gave the colonists time and peace enough to build what was needed.\u201d\n\u201cA new living world,\u201d he says, staring at my face, breathing hard through the increasingly filthy mask.\n\u201cDomed and powered by the endless sunlight, yes. They built reliable habitats with room for the children to explore and grow and new ships were built, and when the children were grown, they flew to new asteroids. That was the dream\u2014a desperate last gambit to give humanity new homes.\u201d\n\u201cSecret homes,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWalk on,\u201d I say. \u201cYou need to hurry.\u201d\nHe believes me. Young legs push, almost running. Looking over his shoulder, he says, \u201cAnd why the secrecy?\u201d\n\u201cTo keep it all safe. So the big earth stations didn\u2019t launch desperate missions. So they didn\u2019t try to pour too many bodies into that final lifeboat.\u201d\n\u201cSure they did,\u201d Orlando says, as if he has worked out the problem for himself. \u201cIt was necessary. Yeah.\u201d\n\u201cThree centuries have passed,\u201d I say.\n\u201cA long time.\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-nine asteroids are inhabited, partly or completely.\u201d\n\u201cShit. How many people total?\u201d\nHe asked that same question before. Once again, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. The voices from the sky won\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\u201cThis is incredible.\u201d\nI touch his back with my human hand and then pull the hand back.\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d he says.\nI remain silent.\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\nThe trail flattens into sand and gravel packed smooth, and we step onto the lake\u2019s surface. Last summer was long and exceptionally dry, leaving the top layers dry as old bone. But ten meters down is moisture, and thirty meters deep is water enough to last until the next good rain. Our feet make crunching sounds on the dry gravel. We walk and he slows, and that\u2019s when I ask, \u201cWhere did you bury them?\u201d\n\u201cMy kits?\u201d\n\u201cYou might need them. It is a long walk.\u201d\nOrlando searches for his landmark\u2014one of the access pipes, sealed and leading down to the water table. Once again he asks, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\u201cMake one guess, son.\u201d\nHe likes that word. \u201cSon.\u201d Reaching the correct pipe, he holds up the compass sewn to his sleeve, finding his bearings. \u201cThey want talented people,\u201d he says. \u201cGood smart sharp kids who can help them.\u201d\nI don\u2019t have to say another word. He believed what I needed him to believe, which is why he left so easily. Everything was so much neater than people expected, and everybody but his parents is celebrating now. Yet this story is so promising and so lovely. I want to keep telling it, even when I know better. Every good lie comes from this desire\u2014the relentless search for beauty and for hope.\n\u201cThe Vestans,\u201d I say. \u201cThey want smart minds, yes. But more than that, they want fresh genes to mix into their limited pool. They\u2019re looking into the long future, saving as much of the old species as possible.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d the boy says. Then he laughs. \u201cA girl. I\u2019m going to get a girl.\u201d\n\u201cProbably several.\u201d\n\u201cThese people must really want me.\u201d He stops and squats. \u201cDiving into the gravity well like this, burning so much fuel just to save me.\u201d\n\u201cYou must be worth it,\u201d I agree.\nWith gloved hands, he starts to dig, flinging gravel up between his legs.\nI stand to one side, supplying the light.\n\u201cCould you help me?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cI can\u2019t. My hands might be damaged.\u201d\nOrlando is in a generous mood. \u201cI suppose so,\u201d he allows, working faster. \u201cThe other people still need doctoring, I guess.\u201d\nI watch him, and I watch quite a lot more. My various antennae reach into the darkness, listening. Searching. I don\u2019t often step outside, escaping the station\u2019s shielded walls. But tonight\u2019s sky is silent. Maybe it will stay this way for the rest of the winter, and maybe longer. The last several decades have grown quieter, the rare bits of radio noise thoroughly encoded. There might be dozens and hundreds of little stations scattered about the Arctic, each taking precautions, keeping their positions and resources hidden from raiders. Or maybe there is no one to talk to, even in code. Either way, I listen, and the boy digs until his hole is wide and hip-deep in the center. Then he straightens his back, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s funny. The bags should be here.\u201d\n\u201cKeep searching,\u201d I urge.\nThose words give him new energy. He shifts to his right and digs again, looking like an animal following a last desperate scent.\n\u201cCull,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cRemoving what weakens, making the whole stronger as a consequence. That\u2019s what it means to cull.\u201d\nHis arms slow, and he looks straight ahead.\n\u201cHumans cull, and worlds cull too,\u201d I say.\nOrlando sits back on the dry gravel. \u201cDo you think maybe somebody moved my kit?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it was stolen,\u201d I agree.\nThen he rises. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t really need it. How far is this walk?\u201d\n\u201cDown the mountains, following this drainage,\u201d I tell him.\n\u201cBut if I\u2019m so important, can\u2019t they come meet me halfway?\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to get close and be seen,\u201d I tell him. \u201cThey promised to be waiting where the old lake sits.\u201d\nThe old lake was an open water reservoir, dry now for fifty years.\n\u201cI know that spot,\u201d he says. \u201cI can run all the way, no problem.\u201d\nI like my lie so much. So much. Humans living above our heads, comfortable and well fed, and thriving among them\u2014essential and worshipped\u2014a generation of doctors who aren\u2019t consumed by every possible worry and hazard and the miserable future for their stations.\nOrlando looks back at me. \u201cI\u2019ll wave. When I\u2019m flying over your head, I\u2019ll give you a big wave.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll watch for you,\u201d I say.\nOrlando turns away.\nI lift my least-human hand, aiming for the back of his neck.\n\u201cWhat a day . . . \u201d he starts to say.\nI drop him into the hole, and as I do with every cull and with every corpse delivered by natural causes, I cut open the skull. Before I kick the sand over the body, I pull out each of the pseudo-worms. I can\u2019t make them anymore. I need to add them to my stockpile\u2014a hoard that grows only larger with time.\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

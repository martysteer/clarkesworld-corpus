One large panoramic viewport made up the far wall of his grandiose office\u2014a perk of being the Director-General of the UN Interworld Relations Organization. Losin sat facing the door instead, so while he talked I stared over his right shoulder at the starscape beyond.\nThe Mask People\u2019s starship floated in the distance, gargantuan yet fragile, a city-sized architectural latticework sprawling in three dimensions. The vessel had synchronized its trajectory with our station\u2019s orbit, so it seemed to hang motionless against a backdrop of crawling stars. I loved the look of it\u2014so still, so stoic. A massive, involuted shell to hide the Mask People and all their teeming emotions.\nNot that it mattered how I felt. I would do my job.\nLosin paused. \u201cAre you listening, Nora?\u201d\nI don\u2019t generally look at people\u2019s faces unless I have a specific reason for reading them. Too late, I remembered how little Losin cared for my natural stoic demeanor.\nI shifted my gaze to make eye contact and twisted my mouth into a reassuring smile. \u201cOf course, sir.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical to reach an agreement with no alterations to the trade proposal. I don\u2019t care what you have to do to convince them, I want signatures on that document as is.\u201d He was in his third decade of politics and had both the gray hair and the attitude to match.\nI played a quick microexpression of surprise across my face, followed by half-concealed disagreement. \u201cWith all due respect, sir, we\u2019re at the start of what will likely be a long and complicated interspecies relationship. Pushing too hard at this juncture could have unforeseen consequences.\u201d Not to mention the consequences of deliberately misrepresenting our intentions, outright lying to them, and attempting to steal from them. All of which I would soon facilitate.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll play the game the way I tell you to,\u201d he said, flashing an unconscious sneer. He thought of me as his puppet, a glorified translator and nothing more.\nA now-familiar flame of spite flared in my chest. To be fair, \u201cpuppet\u201d was pretty much the job description I signed up for. I wore the title of ambassador purely to avoid insulting the Mask People with my negligible political status. Problem was, I couldn\u2019t seem to shut off my brain quite the way Losin wanted.\nI also couldn\u2019t help needling him. \u201cWhat shall I tell the Prime Judge if he asks to meet with you?\u201d\nLosin flinched slightly from fear of the Mask People\u2019s hyperobservant abilities. \u201cThat might be unavoidable.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we could arrange a social event,\u201d I offered, raising my eyebrows with the suggestion. \u201cSome polite conversation but no politics beyond \u2018we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.\u2019 A short introduction would be enough to set their minds at ease.\u201d\nLosin stood and poured a drink from a bottle on the credenza as an excuse to not look at me. At the same time that he resented me for every scrap of limelight he had to share, he understood I was necessary. Me with my unique deficiency, my talent for inexpression.\nHe swirled his scotch, trying to hide his reluctance. \u201cNot a bad idea. I\u2019ll have my secretary put it on the schedule.\u201d\nOut the viewport, a fleck of movement caught my eye. Sunlight reflected off an approaching short-range transport, the shuttle dwarfed in comparison to the Mask ship from which it came. They were coming, eager and well-intentioned. For a fleeting moment, I wished I\u2019d quit politics and taken up life as a hermit.\n\u201cOne more thing,\u201d Losin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a rise in threats against Mask People and the Interworld Relations Organization since the trade talks were announced. Central security has cordoned off an area of the station for the Mask People, but I want you to be extra careful, especially when you\u2019re outside the secure zone.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d I said, and smiled a professionally fake smile\u2014lips a little too tight, eye muscles not quite scrunched enough. \u201cWill that be all?\u201d\nThe newest member of my personal security detail, Iman Amiri, waited outside Losin\u2019s door. He fell into step beside me as I strode down the hallway. He had a restless bounce in his step, and after a moment he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s our status?\u201d\n\u201cThe Prime Judge should be docking soon,\u201d I said. \u201cTime to meet your first Mask People.\u201d\nProtocol demanded that two more security officers meet us at the Bay Two entry hall to be present during interspecies contact. They weren\u2019t two I was particularly fond of. They belonged to the camp who referred to me as \u201cthe robot\u201d behind my back, as if I wouldn\u2019t find out about something so inane. Amiri either hadn\u2019t picked up on the nickname yet, or had decided it wasn\u2019t worth pissing me off just to fit in with his coworkers. I hoped it was the latter; I could use someone smart to balance out these meatheads.\n\u201cNew kid gets the screen,\u201d I declared, and the meathead named Gorsky passed the large, round holographic projection screen to Amiri. I controlled the screen\u2019s image wirelessly, which was very convenient for communicating with Mask People, but the chip behind my ear did little to alleviate the robotic reputation.\nTo Amiri, I said, \u201cYou can talk to them but they won\u2019t be listening to the words\u2014they\u2019ll get the meaning from reading your face.\u201d\nHe nodded, quick and nervous. Nervous was okay\u2014not anything the Mask People hadn\u2019t seen a hundred times before. Hostile would\u2019ve been a problem, but I didn\u2019t read any of that in the microexpressions he kept trying to cover up. The trying was okay too\u2014they would hardly notice the false stoicism overlaid atop the true emotions.\nAt the opposite end of the hall, a light on the wall flashed green to indicate their arrival, and the doors slid silently open to admit the Mask People.\nThe first feature anyone notices about the Mask People is their enormous faces. To say that a Mask Person has an enlarged face is like saying that a giraffe has an elongated neck or a blue whale is a bit heavy. Mask People are mostly face by volume, the round surface covered in feathery, dexterous appendages that they use as their primary means of communication. The facial feathers come in bright, carnival colors\u2014tourmaline green and iridescent violet, sanguine red and sunlit yellow\u2014though that\u2019s not why they\u2019re called Mask People. Still, the feathers are hard to miss.\nMost of their musculoskeletal effort goes into supporting their massive faces, with mobility only earning a distant second place, so the Prime Judge and his entourage shambled forward in a zigzag of awkward steps. I\u2019ve overheard the spaceport brats making Mask-People-tipping jokes the way my great-grandparents may have joked about cow-tipping as children. They did look rather like it wouldn\u2019t take much of a push.\nDespite their innocuous appearance, the Mask People were far from harmless. Their starship came equipped with technologies that made humankind\u2019s ventures into space look like monkeys throwing sticks in the air. Nothing like an imbalance of power to make trade negotiations a little too interesting.\nHumanity\u2019s only advantage was that they had me.\nFollowing the Prime Judge, the Mask Ambassador, and their personal staff came the Mask Bearers, carrying the unwieldy cultural artifacts from which their species took their name. The masks, unlike the Mask People\u2019s true faces, bear no resemblance to carnival dress\u2014they are plain and blank, expressionless, and large enough to entirely cover a Mask Person\u2019s face. Even the eye holes have one-way reflective glass, so the wearer can look out without anyone seeing their eyes. For a race of hyperexpressive beings, masks provide the only means of privacy.\nThe Prime Judge extended one long, skeletal arm to clasp hands in the standard human fashion, and I wrapped my fingers around his skinny digits with an appropriate level of solemnity. Their upper limbs always put me in mind of starvation victims. Good thing I never show what I\u2019m thinking.\nThe Prime Judge greeted me in his native language, facial feathers dancing. Well met, Human Ambassador. Reading their language required a somewhat diffuse gaze; if I stared at any particular spot on their face, I would miss subtleties elsewhere. He was testing me, curious to see how well I understood him.\nWelcome to Sol System, Prime Judge, I said, mentally puppeting the holographic Mask Person face projected by the screen in Amiri\u2019s arms. I tailored my answer to be formal and respectful but with undertones of warmth and gladness. After years of training to be able to puppet my own body, it hadn\u2019t been much of a stretch to adapt to the screen instead. The feathers on the Prime Judge\u2019s cheeks smoothed flat, surprised and impressed with my grasp of his language\u2019s emotive subtleties.\nMask Ambassador, I said, looking at the Mask Person on its left, may I present New Security.\nI translated the Mask Ambassador\u2019s laconic greeting for Amiri and he replied with a simple \u201cHi.\u201d He tucked his chin and glanced up at them and down again several times, awkward and anxious for their approval. I read amusement in the slow twirl of their feathers.\nThe introductions continued until everyone in the room had met everyone else down to the last Mask Bearer. In their culture, ignoring someone with an unmasked face was a terrible insult\u2014even if that person, say a human security officer, would prefer to fade into the background. The custom also meant I had to shake the hand of each person I would shortly be backstabbing during the trade talks.\nBy the end, I was thankful that no actual discussion of policy was planned for the day, simply a mutual confirmation of the schedule for days to come. Once the introductions were completed, the Prime Judge seemed eager to move on to his private quarters; sometimes I think they visit purely to meet new people. Did I mention how very much they enjoy their introductions? It\u2019s the people they\u2019ve already met they grow tired of.\nNot me, though, they don\u2019t get tired of me because they can only read what I give them. By the end of the meeting, the Prime Judge left feeling reassured and a little intrigued. An excellent first impression. I earned their trust and felt sick all the while, knowing what was to come. If my face were chained to my innermost thoughts like a normal person, I would have grimaced.\nOf course, if I were a normal person, the UN never would have slapped the ambassador label on me and shipped me up here. They hired me for the job because I was the only human they could find with the capacity for becoming fluent in the Mask People\u2019s language. Also, because I was the only human who could successfully lie to them.\nWe had the rest of the day free, while the Mask People settled in to their temporary accommodations aboard the station. I dismissed the two meatheads and took Amiri with me when I left the entry hall. At the first major corridor junction, I turned toward the public sectors of the station.\nAmiri raised an eyebrow at that, and I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make a stop.\u201d\nThe Dark Moon Caf\u00e9 offered garish d\u00e9cor and mediocre-to-awful food. More cafeteria than caf\u00e9, it was noisy, crowded, exposed, and I loathed it. We were served lunch, and I hoped my other purpose would be served as well.\n\u201cWhat exactly are we doing here? This is hardly a secure location,\u201d Amiri said from across the table, displeasure showing in the crease of his brow.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fishing for extremists. If they\u2019ve managed to get on board, I want to know about it.\u201d The desire to do the exact opposite of what Losin instructed me to also may have contributed slightly, I admit.\n\u201cDraw them out using yourself as bait?\u201d Amiri thought about it. \u201cThat\u2019s nuts, but it\u2019s my kind of nuts.\u201d\n\u201cIf they\u2019re here, I\u2019d rather we find them before they get a shot at the Mask People.\u201d\nI watched the crowd, scanning for tell-tale microexpressions of hate or disgust. We both picked at our food. Stake-outs weren\u2019t a part of my usual repertoire, and this one gave me a strange combination of boredom and anxiety.\nWhile he kept an eye on the exits, Amiri tried making conversation to relieve the tension. \u201cDid you hear about the new Castillo Method results?\u201d He\u2019d been on the job for three weeks and hadn\u2019t yet figured me out\u2014though he kept fishing for clues.\n\u201cNope,\u201d I said, giving him none.\n\u201cThey\u2019re having some luck with sociopaths.\u201d\nI moved my gaze from the other patrons\u2014none of whom displayed hostile intent\u2014down to my half-eaten slice of quiche without making eye contact. \u201cYou\u2019re suggesting I might be interested in the procedure, with regards to my condition.\u201d\n\u201cThey must be making progress if they can correct sociopathy now. And neural pathway realignment is noninvasive and very low risk. So why not?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d be out of a job, for one thing,\u201d I said. And then, when he didn\u2019t get it, \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, and let himself grin.\nI took another bite, chewed, swallowed. \u201cI wonder how the sociopaths felt about the treatment.\u201d\nHe grinned again. It wasn\u2019t a joke this time.\nI scanned the crowd once more. Either there weren\u2019t any extremists on board, or they weren\u2019t eating lunch at the Dark Moon like half the station was. It was frustrating not knowing, one way or the other. The last thing these trade talks needed was another element of uncertainty.\nI forked one more mouthful, surgically removing the filling from the soggy crust, and slid the plate away. \u201cCome on, new kid. There are other places to check.\u201d\nMy parents thought I was a sociopath for a long time.\nI hardly ever cried as a baby, and I never once smiled. It almost would have been a relief, I think, if I\u2019d turned out to be severely mentally retarded. But as it was, I developed more or less normally, except that I utterly failed to express emotional responses or recognize them in others. My parents went through an endless stream of baffled child psychologists, all the while waiting for the tortured animal carcasses to start showing up.\nBut the problem wasn\u2019t a lack of healthy emotions, simply an inability to communicate them. Finally they found a school\u2014a special and very expensive school\u2014that claimed to be up to the challenge, and they shipped me off. I never interacted with them outside of mandatory holidays after that. To this day I don\u2019t know if they were ashamed of me, or ashamed of themselves for assuming their own daughter was a budding serial killer for so many years.\nIn school, I learned most of the regular drivel, but the classes that mattered were all about facial anatomy and body language and verbal inflection. I learned how to recognize emotions analytically, piece by painstaking little piece, and how to make my own muscles mimic them.\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, I got good at it\u2014really good at it. Like an ESL student who knows better English grammar than a native speaker, I became more fluent in emotional expression than most of the people who use it naturally. The government recruited me when I turned eighteen.\nAround one in four hundred people has a natural ability to read microexpressions and body language such that they can reliably tell when someone is lying. These people have been called \u201cTruth Wizards.\u201d I can do what they do, but I can do the opposite just as well. I suppose that makes me the \u201cFalsehood Wizard.\u201d\nAfter a fruitless afternoon of scanning for extremists, I ate dinner in the security lounge with my staff so we could go over the work schedule for tomorrow. With each successive meeting between humans and Mask People, the anti-alien factions have spewed their xenophobic propaganda louder and louder. The station\u2019s central security screens for anyone who poses a threat, but that just means the extremists need to act smarter to slip through.\nToward the end of the meal, I was finished with the business part and the men were chatting and joking among themselves.\n\u201cHey Amiri, check this out.\u201d Gorsky leaned over and poked me in the arm with his fork. It hurt. They all laughed when I didn\u2019t flinch, all except Amiri who looked distinctly uncomfortable.\nI stared at Gorsky, and my lack of expression set them to laughing for another round. That sound filled me with a black hatred for humanity.\nI picked up my own fork and jabbed it down into the meat of his thigh, metal tines sinking into flesh. Gorsky\u2019s eyes flew open with surprise and he howled his pain.\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired,\u201d I said and stood to leave. \u201cAmiri, come with me.\u201d\nAmiri seemed frozen in his chair for a moment before he scrambled to fall in step behind me. As we left, I heard Gorsky yell, \u201cIt was a joke, you crazy bitch!\u201d\nI thought about re-hiring him just so I could fire him twice. I should have put that whole situation to rest much sooner, before it got out of hand. Not very diplomatic of me. I\u2019ve gotten so used to being isolated and ostracized that I suppose I stopped recognizing it for what it was: suffering in silence.\nStory of my life.\n\u201cThat was sort of amazing, what you did,\u201d Amiri said later. It wasn\u2019t technically his shift anymore, but I didn\u2019t feel like facing the others.\nWe were in the sitting room of my suite\u2014him fiddling with the settings on his standard-issue stunner and me reviewing the hundred-page-long trade proposal I\u2019d be discussing the next day.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern you that your new boss stabbed one of her other employees?\u201d I kept my eyes on the document, half-listening for his answer.\n\u201cNo offense, but if the guy can\u2019t defend himself against a pissed-off lady with a fork, he\u2019s not much of a security officer.\u201d He paused. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, though?\u201d\n\u201cI decided it was time to make a point,\u201d I said, scrolling through to the next page.\n\u201cMore like four points.\u201d I could hear the grin in the timbre of his voice.\nBy page seventeen, I was treading water in an endless sea of legalese. The Mask People want to purchase asteroid mining rights, which is complicated enough on its own given that no one actually has a legal claim to the asteroid belt. And if they agree to trade their propulsion technology, then the very same mining resources suddenly become accessible and potentially desirable to humans, too.\nAmiri interrupted again. \u201cWouldn\u2019t things be easier if you pretended to be normal all the time? I\u2019ve seen you working, you can mimic expressions perfectly. Why not just do that with everyone?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the act is a lie.\u201d I set aside the document and looked up at him, curious to see how he\u2019d react to my answer. \u201cI never feel like smiling\u2014I feel happy, and then I switch on a smile, like a robot executing an if-then command. It may look all warm and fuzzy and genuine to you, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\nHe cringed slightly at the robot reference, but he said, \u201cIf nobody can tell it\u2019s a knock-off, what does it matter that it\u2019s not the real thing?\u201d\n\u201cI would know.\u201d Sometimes it made me angry\u2014the constant expectation that I pretend to be someone I\u2019m not for the comfort and convenience of everyone else\u2014but not right now. He was new and still trying to figure me out, which was more than meathead Gorsky ever did for me.\nIn the morning, I went early to the reception room to see Director-General Losin before the Mask People arrived. His back was to the door when I came in, but I caught him unconsciously wiping clammy palms on his trouser legs. Terrified. I held out a hand to tell my security detail\u2014Amiri and Wellinger\u2014to hang back, and I walked up beside Losin.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not psychic, you know.\u201d\nHe jumped, then glared down at me for startling him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t read your mind, just your face. All you have to do is stay focused on safe thoughts, safe emotions.\u201d\n\u201cI know what I have to do, Nora.\u201d Losin shifted his weight, restless, probably wondering how badly he could screw up his precious trade agreement with a single expression.\nI admit, I was enjoying his discomfort. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They\u2019ll get bored with you pretty quick, so long as you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re hiding something,\u201d I said and smiled sweetly.\nLosin got back at me by assigning one of his own security detail to hold my screen, effectively tethering me to his side to serve as his personal translator for the morning. A small crew of central-security-approved caterers were already set up, and the other human guests began to arrive in ones and twos\u2014whatever dignitaries Losin could manage to round up on short notice.\nThe Prime Judge, the Mask Ambassador, and their sizeable entourage arrived at the reception hall precisely on time. Within minutes, a few of the Mask People tired of Losin\u2019s dignitaries and began to harass the caterers for introductions instead, offending the former and confusing the latter. I wished I could kick back and watch the hilarity ensue. But given that the average person could learn to recognize only a few of the most basic expressions in the Mask language, I was needed for any complicated interactions. My duties occupied my full attention.\nOr almost all of it.\nA movement in my peripheral vision distracted me. Across the room, one of the caterers walked with too much tension in his step and clutched his tray nervously. He was not here with the sole intention of serving appetizers.\nI caught Amiri\u2019s eye, then transferred my gaze quickly to the suspect and back again. He quirked a questioning eyebrow, not able to see the signs I saw. I widened my eyes and tilted my head down, insistent. A twitch of his shoulder, ceding the point, and he slid through the crowd in pursuit.\nAmiri attempted to escort him out quietly, but the caterer stood his ground and started making a scene. The room fell silent as all the humans craned their necks to see what was going on. A couple other security officers descended on the caterer, and the ruckus ended with him stunned and dragged out of the room. At the door, Amiri turned to give me a slight nod, confirming that the suspect had something on him. Not a weapon, from Amiri\u2019s expression. Poison, maybe. I\u2019d have to ask him later.\nI turned around again, intent on resuming my translator duties, but I froze when I saw Losin. His expression screamed, That moron is going to ruin all my plans.\nI kept my own expression impassive and leaned in close to him. \u201cTake a walk. Your face is a mess.\u201d\nHe scowled, I met his gaze with an expressionless stare, and after a moment he relented. He wandered off and found a group of humans to socialize with until his thoughts were back under control. Relief washed through me. At least Losin had the sense to listen when it counted.\nI caught the Prime Judge watching me, and the feeling of relief evaporated. My screen-holder in tow, I closed the distance to speak with the Prime Judge.\nYou saw all of that, didn\u2019t you? I said, chagrined.\nIt rippled its facial feathers in the Mask Person equivalent of a wry smile. Of course.\nWhy didn\u2019t you point out the threat before I noticed it?\nI was curious to observe how your species would handle the situation.\nAnd? I resisted the urge to look for Losin and check whether he had his expression under control yet.\nThe experience was informative, the Prime Judge said with a hint of cautiousness, almost suspicion.\nI wondered whether the cautiousness was a response to the threat itself, or to Losin\u2019s too-revealing reaction. Bluntness was often seen as a virtue in the Mask culture, so I said, It is not entirely safe for you here.\nYes, it said, at once resigned and forgiving\u2014Losin had insisted on hosting the trade talks on the station. It would have been safer to meet on the starship, where we have adequate protection.\nDoubt made me pause. This was supposed to be a social gathering, not a political t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate, but I needed to know more about how they viewed their own technology. Just \u201cadequate?\u201d Your species could sterilize the surface of our planet if you so desired.\nThe Prime Judge\u2019s feathers smoothed with genuine surprise. Possessing the ability and possessing the intention are entirely different matters, Ambassador.\nIndeed. If only that answer would satisfy Losin.\nI knew that it wouldn\u2019t. Losin was committed to a course of action, and I had no choice but to proceed as he\u2019d planned.\nThe afternoon was reserved for the real work: trade negotiations. Amiri waited for me to finish lunch while Wellinger went ahead to secure the conference room. This arrangement was fine by me, since meathead Wellinger wasn\u2019t likely to forgive me the Gorsky incident any time soon. I emptied my coffee cup, tucked all the necessary documents into a slim shoulder-bag, and made eye contact with Amiri to tell him I was ready.\nBefore Amiri joined my staff, I used to prefer multiple escorts. They talked among themselves and I could disengage, mentally withdraw from their company. Now it seemed almost comfortable, having Amiri all to myself.\nWe walked the spaceport corridors toward the designated meeting space, Amiri unconsciously matching my stride. Out in public, half his attention focused on scanning and evaluating\u2014not too vigilant to hold up a conversation, but I wasn\u2019t exactly feeling chatty with the trade negotiations only minutes away, so we walked in silence. The hallways seemed ominously long today.\nI told myself I was just doing my job. The decisions had already been made by people more important and more knowledgeable than me. I was only a messenger, and none of it would be my fault. Not really.\nOut of the corner of my eye, I saw Amiri tense in a way that shot adrenaline through my veins, and then all hell broke loose. The first two men closed with Amiri before he could unholster his stunner. The third and fourth stepped around them to come at me from both sides.\nThe one on my left said, \u201cEat this, bitch.\u201d The one on my right fingered the handle of his shiv and said nothing. My own fingers tensed around the strap of my shoulder bag, readying to use it as a shield.\nThe sound of punches landing emanated from Amiri\u2019s general direction, and his assailants fell to the ground, first one and then the other in rapid succession. He spun to face me, threw up his arm, and the other two dropped to the floor unconscious.\nGod, he was fast. I never even saw him draw the stunner.\nBack in my suite, I sipped from the glass Amiri gave me, hand shaking. Adrenaline\u2014one of the few biochemicals I can honestly express, since it bypasses the brain and acts directly on muscle function.\nI set the glass down so I wouldn\u2019t drop it. \u201cWe need to reschedule the meeting.\u201d\n\u201cAlready done,\u201d said Amiri.\n\u201cAnd have Gorsky forcibly removed from the station.\u201d\n\u201cGorsky?\u201d\n\u201cThey were waiting for me. There\u2019s a short list of people who could\u2019ve told them my schedule, and only one who recently took a fork in the leg.\u201d\n\u201cPoint,\u201d he said, and dialed central security on his comm.\nWhen he finished the call, he sat down across from me and leaned forward in the way people do when they\u2019re trying to read someone. Force of habit, I suppose. He said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The adrenaline high was fading and I felt too worn out to put on an act for him. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m grateful for the delay.\u201d\n\u201cUh-oh. That doesn\u2019t sound good.\u201d\nI paused, considering how much to tell him. He\u2019d saved my life; it seemed absurd to distrust him now. \u201cIn exchange for the asteroid mining rights they\u2019ve requested, human technicians will be given full access to their onboard systems in the starship. And we promise not to copy any of their offensive technology, of course.\u201d I looked up, to see if he got it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d Amiri said. The kid was smart, I\u2019d been right about that. \u201cThey\u2019re going to trust us not to steal their weapon designs? That\u2019ll end well. And you\u2019re supposed to be selling this as a good plan?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to establish a relationship of trust.\u201d Trust we could exploit, of course. Never mind that, in the process of ensuring our martial adequacy against the Mask People, we might accidentally start the very war we sought to avoid. \u201cBesides, our technicians are scrupulous and beyond reproach. That\u2019s the party line.\u201d\nAmiri threw me a skeptical look. \u201cThe problem with telling perfect lies is that you might start believing them yourself.\u201d\nI would have winced then, were I normal. Amiri had no idea how close he came to hitting the mark\u2014there\u2019s nothing I fear more than the thought of the lies starting to control me, and not the other way around.\nI didn\u2019t share that with him. It was my right not to. I\u2019m a professional at leaving things hidden and I don\u2019t regret it\u2014I tell myself I never regret it. I tell myself I like holding the world at arm\u2019s length.\n\u201cYou should call Wellinger. He\u2019s probably still waiting in the conference room,\u201d I said, ending the conversation.\nThe next morning, Amiri was on duty again for the rescheduled negotiations with the Mask People. We arrived at the conference room without incident. Wellinger reported the room secure and I told him to wait outside the door, which was against protocol but he did it anyway. I needed complete control over the negotiations, and I didn\u2019t want his negative expressions cluttering up the room. Might give the Mask People the wrong impression about me\u2014or the right one.\nThe Mask People entered through a door at the opposite end of the room, a small entourage preceding the more important political figures. The Prime Judge came in last, and he was wearing his mask.\nI glanced at Amiri, who watched the masked Prime Judge with curiosity smeared all over his face. I said, \u201cThink about something else.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely rude to inquire about mask wearing.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYour face was,\u201d I interrupted. \u201cThink about anything else. You can think about screwing your girlfriend for all I care, just don\u2019t wonder about the masks.\u201d\nHe hunched his shoulders a little, embarrassed, and covered it up with a wry answer. \u201cNo pink elephants either, huh?\u201d\nI couldn\u2019t blame him though. Secretly, I liked seeing them with their masks on, peaceful and flawlessly impassive. I am like a Mask Person who can\u2019t take off the mask. I can never have an honest conversation with my own species; either it\u2019s not honest, or it\u2019s not a conversation, not the kind they want anyway. At least the Mask People understand the virtue of being hidden. Safety in isolation.\nThe Prime Judge\u2019s mask came off and was passed to a Mask Bearer. Then the usual extensive greetings were exchanged all around, and we settled down to business.\nThe first hour or so of the meeting was an overview of the trade proposal, each party confirming that we understood all of the major points. Though I didn\u2019t look at Amiri, his presence weighed on my awareness. Finally I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, I couldn\u2019t stand not knowing what he was thinking. I threw him a sideways glance.\nHe smiled back at me with his eyes. It was only a momentary tensing of his lower lids, but I read warmth and confidence there. It was a smile that said, I\u2019m not worried because I trust you\u2019ll do the right thing.\nThe smile hit me like a punch, and I was yet again grateful my reaction stayed internal. The Prime Judge only saw Amiri\u2019s half of the visual conversation. But beneath my silent face, Amiri\u2019s words from last night echoed around my brain.\nI was born to lie, that much was inescapable. But Amiri had been right: I should make the lies, not let the lies make me. Even a liar can sometimes show the truth about themselves, embedded in the rhyme and meter of their falsehoods.\nAs the meeting progressed, I meticulously emoted a fraction less enthusiasm than formal Mask-Person etiquette dictated. Not enough difference for my human overseers to detect, but then the Prime Judge was ever so much more sensitive than they were. All I needed was to light a spark of suspicion.\nWe reached the end of the document and the conversation floated away from the particulars to less concrete matters. The Prime Judge asked, How do your superiors feel about this agreement? A question that would have seemed odd between human ambassadors, but Mask People are accustomed to always knowing how everyone feels.\nThey are very eager to establish economic relations, I said. Entirely true, and beyond reproach from the viewpoint of a human negotiator. But on they, I gave a subtle emphasis of detachment, expressing a desire to disassociate myself from them.\nThe Prime Judge paused, considering my meaning. They come with honorable intent?\nThey will thoroughly fulfill their trade obligations\u2014which was also true, but not the same as a \u201cyes.\u201d\nWe are concerned that trade remain peaceful and amicable.\nYour offensive technology is far superior. How could humans pose a threat to you?\nThe Prime Judge rippled his feathers thoughtfully. Thank you, Ambassador. I believe we have reached an understanding.\nThe thing about perfect liars is they can fool anybody. You can never be sure whose side they\u2019re on.\nDirector-General Losin was, needless to say, extremely displeased. Shall I describe his anger? The deep scowl, the tight jaw, the jutted chin? Anger is a simple emotion to read\u2014it so rarely tries to hide itself.\n\u201cWhat happened in there? You seemed to be doing an acceptable job at the start.\u201d He\u2019d been watching on the security cam, of course. \u201cThen suddenly they want to back out and redraft the agreement? Explain that to me!\u201d\nI shrugged, lacing the gesture with nervousness and confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, sir.\u201d\n\u201cYou damn well must\u2019ve screwed something up.\u201d\n\u201cThey changed their minds. I have no idea why.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to tell me with a straight face that you did everything in your power to convince them to approve the proposal?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I lied with ease. \u201cNow that is something I can do.\u201d\nGwendolyn Clare resides in North Carolina, where she tends a vegetable garden and a flock of backyard ducks and wonders why she ever lived in the frozen northlands.

Your eyes aren\u2019t dry. Neither is the alien sky. Your shoulders ache and your stomach hurts. Blue woman, blue woman, the chant runs through your head as you limp toward a portal\u2019s bright mouth. You\u2019re leaving, but you intend to return. You have allies yet.\n Blue stands for many things at the end of time: for the forgotten, blazing blue stars of aeons past; the antithesis of redshift; the color of uncut veins beneath your skin.\n This story is written in blue ink, although you do not know that yet.\n Blue is more than a fortunate accident. Jenny Chang usually writes in black ink or pencil. She\u2019s been snowed in at her mom\u2019s house since yesterday and is dawdling over physics homework. Now she\u2019s out of lead. The only working pen in the house is blue.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll go shopping the instant the roads are clear,\u201d her mom says.\n Jenny mumbles something about how she hates homework over winter break. Actually, she isn\u2019t displeased. There\u2019s something neatly alien about all those equations copied out in blue ink, problems and their page numbers. It\u2019s as if blue equations come from a different universe than the ones printed in the textbook.\n While her mom sprawls on the couch watching TV, Jenny pads upstairs to the guest room and curls up in bed next to the window. Fingers of frost cover the glass. With her index finger, Jenny writes a list of numbers: pi, H0 for Hubble\u2019s constant, her dad\u2019s cellphone number, her school\u2019s zip code. Then she wipes the window clear of mist, and shivers. Everything outside is almost blue-rimmed in the twilight.\n Jenny resumes her homework, biting her nails between copying out answers to two significant figures and doodling spaceships in the margins. There\u2019s a draft from the window, but that\u2019s all right. Winter\u2019s child that she is\u2014February 16, to be exact\u2014Jenny thinks better with a breath of cold.\n Except, for a moment, the draft is hot like a foretaste of hell. Jenny stops still. All the frost has melted and is running in rivulets down the glass. And there\u2019s a face at the window.\n The sensible thing to do would be to scream. But the face is familiar, the way equations in blue are familiar. It could be Jenny\u2019s own, five ragged years in the future. The woman\u2019s eyes are dark and bleak, asking for help without expecting it.\n \u201cHold on,\u201d Jenny says. She goes to the closet to grab her coat. From downstairs, she hears her mom laughing at some TV witticism.\n Then Jenny opens the window, and the world falls out. This doesn\u2019t surprise her as much as it should. The wind shrieks and the cold hits her like a fist. It\u2019s too bad she didn\u2019t put on her scarf and gloves while she was at it.\n The woman offers a hand. She isn\u2019t wearing gloves. Nor is she shivering. Maybe extremes of temperature don\u2019t mean the same thing in blue universes. Maybe it\u2019s normal to have blue-tinted lips, there. Jenny doesn\u2019t even wear make-up.\n The woman\u2019s touch warms Jenny, as though they\u2019ve stepped into a bubble of purloined heat. Above them, stars shine in constellations that Jenny recognizes from the ceiling of her father\u2019s house, the ones Mom and Dad helped her put up when she was in third grade. Constellations with names like Fire Truck and Ladybug Come Home, constellations that you won\u2019t find in any astronomer\u2019s catalogue.\n Jenny looks at her double and raises an eyebrow, because any words she could think of would emerge frozen, like the world around them. She wonders where that hell-wind came from and if it has a name.\n \u201cThe end of the world is coming,\u201d the blue woman says. Each syllable is crisp and certain.\n I don\u2019t believe in the end of the world, Jenny wants to say, except she\u2019s read her physics textbook. She\u2019s read the sidebar about things like the sun swelling into a red giant and the universe\u2019s heat-death. She looks up again, and maybe she\u2019s imagining it, but these stars are all the wrong colors, and they\u2019re either too bright or not bright enough. Instead, Jenny asks, \u201cAre my mom and dad going to be okay?\u201d\n \u201cAs okay as anyone else,\u201d the blue woman says.\n \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d She can no more doubt the blue woman than she can doubt the shape of the sun.\n This earns her a moment\u2019s smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a fight,\u201d the blue woman says, \u201cand everyone fell. Everyone fell.\u201d She says it the second time as though things might change, as though there\u2019s a magic charm for reversing the course of events. \u201cI\u2019m the only one left, because I can walk through possibilities. Now there\u2019s you.\u201d\n They set off together. A touch at her elbow tells Jenny to turn left. There\u2019s a bright flash at the corner of her eyes. Between one blink and the next, they\u2019re standing in a devastated city, crisscrossed by skewed bridges made of something brighter than steel, more brilliant than glass.\n \u201cWhere are we?\u201d Jenny asks.\n \u201cWe\u2019re at humanity\u2019s last outpost,\u201d the blue woman says. \u201cTell me what you see.\u201d\n \u201cRats with red eyes and metal hands,\u201d Jenny says just as one pauses to stare at her. It stands up on its hind feet and makes a circle-sign at her with one of its hands, as if it\u2019s telling her things will be all right. Then it scurries into the darkness. \u201cBuildings that go so high up I can\u2019t see their tops, and bridges between them. Flying cars.\u201d They come in every color, these faraway cars, every color but blue. Jenny begins to stammer under the weight of detail: \u201cSkeletons wrapped in silver wires\u201d\u2014out of the corner of her eye, she thinks she sees one twitch, and decides she\u2019d rather not know\u2014\u201cand glowing red clocks on the walls that say it\u2019s midnight even though there\u2019s light in the sky, and silhouettes far away, like people except their joints are all wrong.\u201d\n And the smells, too, mostly smoke and ozone, as though everything has been burned away by fire and lightning, leaving behind the ghost-essence of a city, nothing solid.\n \u201cWhat you see isn\u2019t actually there,\u201d the blue woman says. She taps Jenny\u2019s shoulder again.\n They resume walking. The only reason Jenny doesn\u2019t halt dead in her tracks is that she\u2019s afraid that the street will crumble into pebbles, the pebbles into dust, and leave her falling through eternity the moment she stops.\n The blue woman smiles a little. \u201cNot like that. Things are very different at the end of time. Your mind is seeing a translation of everything into more familiar terms.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Jenny asks. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know how to fight. If it\u2019s that kind of battle.\u201d She draws mini-comics in the margins of her notes sometimes, when the teachers think she\u2019s paying attention. Sometimes, in the comics, she wields two mismatched swords, and sometimes a gun; sometimes she has taloned wings, and sometimes she rides in a starship sized perfectly for one. She fights storm-dragons and equations turned into sideways alien creatures. (If pressed, she will admit the influence of Calvin and Hobbes.) But unless she\u2019s supposed to brain someone with the flute she didn\u2019t think to bring (she plays in the school band), she\u2019s not going to be any use in a fight, at least not the kind of fight that happens at the end of time. Jenny\u2019s mom made her take a self-defense class two years ago, before the divorce, and mostly what Jenny remembers is the floppy-haired instructor saying, If someone pulls a gun on you and asks for your wallet, give him your wallet. You are not an action hero.\n The blue woman says, \u201cI know. I wanted a veteran of the final battles\u201d\u2014she says it without disapproval\u2014\u201cbut they all died, too.\u201d\n This time Jenny does stop. \u201cYou brought them here to die.\u201d\n The woman lifts her chin. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done that. I showed them the final battle, the very last one, and they chose to fight. We\u2019re going there now, so you can decide.\u201d\n Jenny read the stories where you travel back in time and shoot someone\u2019s grandfather or step on some protozoan, and the act unravels the present stitch by stitch until all that\u2019s left is a skein of history gone wrong. \u201cIs that such a good idea?\u201d she asks.\n \u201cThey won\u2019t see us. We won\u2019t be able to affect anything.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t even have a weapon,\u201d Jenny says, thinking of the girl in the mini-comics with her two swords, her gun. Jenny is tolerably good at arm-wrestling her girl friends at high school, but she doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s going to help.\n The woman says, \u201cThat can be changed.\u201d\n Not fixed, as though Jenny were something wrong, but changed. The word choice is what makes her decide to keep going. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the battle,\u201d Jenny says.\n The light in the sky changes as they walk, as though all of winter were compressed into a single day of silver and grey and scudding darkness. Once or twice, Jenny could almost swear that she sees a flying car change shape, growing wings like that of a delta kite and swooping out of sight. There\u2019s soot in the air, subtle and unpleasant, and Jenny wishes for sunglasses, even though it\u2019s not all that bright, any sort of protection. Lightning runs along the streets like a living thing, writing jagged blue-white equations. It keeps its distance, however.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just curious,\u201d the blue woman says when Jenny asks about it. She doesn\u2019t elaborate.\n The first sign of the battle, although Jenny doesn\u2019t realize it for a while, is the rain. \u201cIs the rain real?\u201d Jenny says, wondering what future oddity would translate into inclement weather.\n \u201cEverything\u2019s an expression of some reality.\u201d\n That probably means no. Especially since the rain is touching everything in the world except them.\n The second sign is all the corpses, and this she does recognize. The stench hits her first. It\u2019s not the smell of meat, or formaldehyde from 9th grade biology (she knows a fresh corpse shouldn\u2019t smell like formaldehyde, but that\u2019s the association her brain makes), but asphalt and rust and fire. She would have expected to hear something first, like the deafening chatter of guns. Maybe fights in the future are silent.\n Then she sees the fallen. Bone-deep, she knows which are ours and which are theirs. Ours are the rats with the clever metal hands, their fingers twisted beyond salvage; the sleek bicycles (bicycles!) with broken spokes, reflectors flashing crazily in the lightning; the men and women in coats the color of winter rain, red washing away from their wounds. The blue woman\u2019s breath hitches as though she\u2019s seeing this for the first time, as though each body belongs to an old friend. Jenny can\u2019t take in all the raw death. The rats grieve her the most, maybe because one of them greeted her in this place of unrelenting strangeness.\n Theirs are all manner of things, including steel serpents, their scales etched with letters from an alphabet of despair; stilt-legged robots with guns for arms; more men and women, in uniforms of all stripes, for at the evening of the world there will be people fighting for entropy as well as against it. Some of them are still standing, and written in their faces\u2014even the ones who don\u2019t have faces\u2014is their triumph.\n Jenny looks at the blue woman. The blue woman continues walking, so Jenny keeps pace with her. They stop before one of the fallen, a dark-skinned man. Jenny swallows and eyes one of the serpents, which is swaying next to her, but it takes no notice of her.\n \u201cHe was so determined that we should fight, whatever the cost,\u201d the blue woman says. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s gone.\u201d\n There\u2019s a gun not far from the fallen man\u2019s hand. Jenny reaches for it, then hesitates, waiting for permission. The blue woman doesn\u2019t say yes, doesn\u2019t say no, so Jenny touches it anyway. The metal is utterly cold. Jenny pulls her fingers away with a bitten-off yelp.\n \u201cIt\u2019s empty,\u201d the blue woman says. \u201cEverything\u2019s empty.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jenny says. She doesn\u2019t know this man, but it\u2019s not about her.\n The blue woman watches as Jenny straightens, leaving the gun on the ground.\n \u201cIf I say no,\u201d Jenny says slowly, \u201cis there anyone else?\u201d\n The blue woman\u2019s eyes close for a moment. \u201cNo. You\u2019re the last. I would have spared you the choice if I could have.\u201d\n \u201cHow many of me were there?\u201d\n \u201cI lost count after a thousand or so,\u201d the blue woman says. \u201cMost of them were more like me. Some of them were more like you.\u201d\n A thousand Jenny Changs, a thousand blue women. More. Gone, one by one, like a scatterfall of rain. \u201cDid all of them say yes?\u201d Jenny asks.\n The blue woman shakes her head.\n \u201cAnd none of the ones who said yes survived.\u201d\n \u201cNone of them.\u201d\n \u201cIf that\u2019s the case,\u201d Jenny says, \u201cwhat makes you special?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m living on borrowed possibilities,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the battle ends, I\u2019ll be gone too, no matter which way it ends.\u201d\n Jenny looks around her, then squeezes her eyes shut, thinking. Two significant figures, she thinks inanely. \u201cWho started the fight?\u201d She\u2019s appalled that she sounds like her mom.\n \u201cThere\u2019s always an armageddon around the corner,\u201d the blue woman says. \u201cThis happens to be the one that he found.\u201d\n The dark-skinned man. Who was he, that he could persuade people to take a last stand like this? Maybe it\u2019s not so difficult when a last stand is the only thing left. That solution displeases her, though.\n Her heart is hammering. \u201cI won\u2019t do it,\u201d Jenny says. \u201cTake me home.\u201d\n The blue woman\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cYou are the last,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cI thought you would understand.\u201d\n Everything hinges on one thing: is the blue woman different enough from Jenny that Jenny can lie to her, and be believed?\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jenny says.\n \u201cVery well,\u201d the blue woman says.\n Jenny strains to keep her eyes open at the crucial moment. When the blue woman reaches for her hand, Jenny sees the portal, a shimmer of blue light. She grabs the blue woman and shoves her through. The last thing Jenny hears from the blue woman is a muffled protest.\n Whatever protection the blue woman\u2019s touch afforded her is gone. The rain drenches her shirt and runs in cold rivulets through her hair, into her eyes, down her back. Jenny reaches again for the fallen man\u2019s gun. It\u2019s cold, but she has a moment\u2019s warmth in her yet.\n She might not be able to save the world, but she can at least save herself.\n It\u2019s the end of the school day and you\u2019re waiting for Jenny\u2019s mother to pick you up. A man walks up to you. He wears a coat as grey as rain, and his eyes are pale against dark skin. \u201cYou have to come with me,\u201d he says, awkward and serious at once. You recognize him, of course. You remember when he first recruited you, in another timeline. You remember what he looked like fallen in the battle at the end of time, with a gun knocked out of his hand.\n \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d you say, kindly, because it will take him time to understand that you\u2019re not the blue woman anymore, that you won\u2019t do the things the blue woman did.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d he says. \u201cPlease. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d He knows better than to grab your arm. \u201cThere\u2019s a battle\u2014\u201d\n Once upon a time, you listened to his plea. Part of you is tempted to listen this time around, to abandon the life that Jenny left you and take up his banner. But you know how that story ends.\n \u201cI\u2019m not in your story anymore,\u201d you explain to him. \u201cYou\u2019re in mine.\u201d\n The man doesn\u2019t look like he belongs in a world of parking tickets and potted begonias and pencil sharpeners. But he can learn, the way you have.\n Yoon Ha Lee's works have appeared in Lightspeed, Tor.com, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.

A room as barren as a fishbowl.\n \u201cI hate you.\u201d\n Little fists, clenching: one of the cameras, set to motion-cap, zoomed on them automatically. Two others watched the adults, mother, father on opposite sides of the room. The machines watched the players: half a world away, Stavros watched the machines.\n \u201cI hate you I hate you I HATE you!\u201d\n The girl was screaming now, her face contorted in anger and anguish. There were tears at the edges of her eyes but they stayed there, never falling. Her parents shifted like nervous animals, scared of the anger, used to the outbursts but far from comfortable with them.\n At least this time she was using words. Usually she just howled.\n She leaned against the blanked window, fists pounding. The window took her assault like hard white rubber, denting slightly, then rebounding. One of the few things in the room that bounced back when she struck out; one less thing to break.\n \u201cJeannie, hush . . . \u201d Her mother reached out a hand. Her father, as usual, stood back, a mixture of anger and resentment and confusion on his face.\n Stavros frowned. A veritable pillar of paralysis, that man.\n And then: They don\u2019t deserve her.\n The screaming child didn\u2019t turn, her back a defiant slap at Kim and Andrew Goravec. Stavros had a better view: Jeannie\u2019s face was just a few centimeters away from the southeast pickup. For all the pain it showed, for all the pain Jeannie had felt in the four short years of her physical life, those few tiny drops that never fell were the closest she ever came to crying.\n \u201cMake it clear,\u201d she demanded, segueing abruptly from anger to petulance.\n Kim Goravec shook her head. \u201cHoney, we\u2019d love to show you outside. Remember before, how much you liked it? But you have to promise not to scream at it all the time. You didn\u2019t used to, honey, you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNow!\u201d Back to rage, the pure, white-hot anger of a small child.\n The pads on the wall panel were greasy from Jeannie\u2019s repeated, sticky-fingered attempts to use them herself. Andrew flashed a begging look at his wife: Please, let\u2019s just give her what she wants.\n His wife was stronger. \u201cJeannie, we know it\u2019s difficult\u2014\u201d\n Jeannie turned to face the enemy. The north pickup got it all: the right hand rising to the mouth, the index finger going in. The defiant glare in those glistening, focused eyes.\n Kim took a step forward. \u201cJean, honey, no!\u201d\n They were baby teeth, still, but sharp. They\u2019d bitten to the bone before Mommy even got within touching distance. A red stain blossomed from Jeannie\u2019s mouth, flowed down her chin like some perverted reenactment of mealtime messes as a baby, and covered the lower half of her face in an instant. Above the gore, bright angry eyes said gotcha.\n Without a sound Jeannie Goravec collapsed, eyes rolling back in her head as she pitched forward. Kim caught her just before her head hit the floor. \u201cOh God, Andy, she\u2019s fainted, she\u2019s in shock, she\u2014\u201d\n Andrew didn\u2019t move. One hand was buried in the pocket of his blazer, fiddling with something.\n Stavros felt his mouth twitch. Is that a remote control in your pocket or are you just glad to\u2014\n Kim had the tube of liquid skin out, sprayed it onto Jeannie\u2019s hand while cradling the child\u2019s head in her lap. The bleeding slowed. After a moment Kim looked back at her husband, who was standing motionless and unhelpful against the wall. He had that look on his face, that giveaway look that Stavros was seeing so often these days.\n \u201cYou turned her off,\u201d Kim said, her voice rising. \u201cAfter everything we\u2019d agreed on, you still turned her off?!\u201d\n Andrew shrugged helplessly. \u201cKim . . . \u201d\n Kim refused to look at him. She rocked back and forth, tuneless breath whistling between her teeth, Jeannie\u2019s head still in her lap. Kim and Andrew Goravec with their bundle of joy. Between them, the cable connecting Jeannie\u2019s head to the server shivered on the floor like a disputed boundary.\n Stavros had this metaphoric image of her: Jean Goravec, buried alive in the airless dark, smothered by tonnes of earth\u2014finally set free. Jean Goravec coming up for air.\n Another image, of himself this time: Stavros Mikalaides, liberator. The man who made it possible for her to experience, however briefly, a world where the virtual air was sweet and the bonds nonexistent. Certainly there\u2019d been others in on the miracle\u2014a dozen tech-heads, twice as many lawyers\u2014but they\u2019d all vanished over time, their interest fading with proof-of-principal or the signing of the last waiver. The damage was under control, the project was in a holding pattern; there was no need to waste more than a single Terracon employee on mere cruise control. So only Stavros remained\u2014and to Stavros, Jeannie had never been a \u201cproject.\u201d She was his as much as the Goravecs\u2019. Maybe more.\n But even Stavros still didn\u2019t know what it was really like for her. He wondered if it was physically possible for anyone to know. When Jean Goravec slipped the leash of her fleshly existence, she awoke into a reality where the very laws of physics had expired.\n It hadn\u2019t started that way, of course. The system had booted up with years of mundane, real-world environments on file, each lovingly rendered down to the dust motes. But they\u2019d been flexible, responsive to the needs of any developing intellect. In hindsight, maybe too flexible. Jean Goravec had edited her personal reality so radically that even Stavros\u2019 mechanical intermediaries could barely parse it. This little girl could turn a forest glade into a bloody Roman coliseum with a thought. Unleashed, Jean lived in a world where all bets were off.\n A thought-experiment in child abuse: place a newborn into an environment devoid of vertical lines. Keep her there until the brain settles, until the wiring has congealed. Whole assemblies of pattern-matching retinal cells, aborted for lack of demand, will be forever beyond recall. Telephone poles, the trunks of trees, the vertical aspects of skyscrapers\u2014your victim will be neurologically blind to such things for life.\n So what happens to a child raised in a world where vertical lines dissolve, at a whim, into circles or fractals or a favorite toy?\n We\u2019re the impoverished ones, Stavros thought. Next to Jean, we\u2019re blind.\n He could see what she started with, of course. His software read the patterns off her occipital cortex, translated them flawlessly into images projected onto his own tactical contacts. But images aren\u2019t sight, they\u2019re just . . . raw material. There are filters all along the path: receptor cells, firing thresholds, pattern-matching algorithms. Endless stores of past images, an experiential visual library to draw on. More than vision, sight is a subjective stew of infinitesimal enhancements and corruptions. Nobody in the world could interpret Jean\u2019s visual environment better than Stavros Mikalaides, and he\u2019d barely been able to make sense of those shapes for years.\n She was simply, immeasurably, beyond him. It was one of the things he loved most about her.\n Now, mere seconds after her father had cut the cord, Stavros watched Jean Goravec ascend into her true self. Heuristic algorithms upgraded before his eyes; neural nets ruthlessly pared and winnowed trillions of redundant connections; intellect emerged from primordial chaos. Namps-per-op dropped like the heavy end of a teeter-totter: at the other end of that lever, processing efficiency rose into the stratosphere.\n This was Jean. They have no idea, Stavros thought, what you\u2019re capable of.\n She woke up screaming.\n \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jean, I\u2019m here.\u201d He kept his voice calm to help her calm down.\n Jean\u2019s temporal lobe flickered briefly at the input. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she said.\n \u201cAnother nightmare?\u201d\n \u201cOh, God.\u201d Breath too fast, pulse too high, adrenocortical analogs off the scale. It could have been the telemetry of a rape.\n He thought of short-circuiting those responses. Half a dozen tweaks would make her happy. But half a dozen tweaks would also turn her into someone else. There is no personality beyond the chemical\u2014and while Jean\u2019s mind was fashioned from electrons rather than proteins, analogous rules applied.\n \u201cI\u2019m here, Jean,\u201d he repeated. A good parent knew when to step in, and when suffering was necessary for growth. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n Eventually, she settled down.\n \u201cNightmare.\u201d There were sparks in the parietal subroutines, a tremor lingering in her voice. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit, Stav. Scary dreams, that\u2019s the definition. But that implies there\u2019s some other kind, and I can\u2019t\u2014I mean, why is it always like this? Was it always like this?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d No, it wasn\u2019t.\n She sighed. \u201cThese words I learn, none of them really seem to fit anything exactly, you know?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re just symbols, Jean.\u201d He grinned. At times like this he could almost forget the source of those dreams, the stunted, impoverished existence of some half-self trapped in distant meat. Andrew Goravec\u2019s act of cowardice had freed her from that prison, for a while at least. She soared now, released to full potential. She mattered.\n \u201cSymbols. That\u2019s what dreams are supposed to be, but . . . I don\u2019t know. There\u2019re all these references to dreams in the library, and none of them seem that much different from just being awake. And when I am asleep, it\u2019s all just\u2014screams, almost, only dopplered down. Really sludgy. And shapes. Red shapes.\u201d A pause. \u201cI hate bedtime.\u201d\n \u201cWell, you\u2019re awake now. What are you up for today?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I need to get away from this place.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t know what place she meant. By default she woke up in the house, an adult residence designed for human sensibilities. There were also parks and forests and oceans, instantly accessible. By now, though, she\u2019d changed them all past his ability to recognize.\n But it was only a matter of time before her parents wanted her back. Whatever she wants, Stavros told himself. As long as she\u2019s here. Whatever she wants.\n \u201cI want out,\u201d Jean said.\n Except that. \u201cI know,\u201d he sighed.\n \u201cMaybe then I can leave these nightmares behind.\u201d\n Stavros closed his eyes, wished there was some way to be with her. Really with her, with this glorious, transcendent creature who\u2019d never known him as anything but a disembodied voice.\n \u201cStill having a hard time with that monster?\u201d Jean asked.\n \u201cMonster?\u201d\n \u201cYou know. The bureaucracy.\u201d\n He nodded, smiling\u2014then, remembering, said, \u201cYeah. Always the same story, day in, day out.\u201d\n Jean snorted. \u201cI\u2019m still not convinced that thing even exists, you know. I checked the library for a slightly less wonky definition, but now I think you and the library are both screwed in the head.\u201d\n He winced at the epithet; it was certainly nothing he\u2019d ever taught her. \u201cHow so?\u201d\n \u201cOh, right, Stav. Like natural selection would ever produce a hive-based entity whose sole function is to sit with its thumb up its collective butt being inefficient. Tell me another one.\u201d\n A silence, stretching. He watched as microcurrent trickled through her prefrontal cortex.\n \u201cYou there, Stav?\u201d she said at last.\n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m here.\u201d He chuckled, quietly. Then: \u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d she said easily. \u201cWhatever that is.\u201d\n Jean\u2019s environment changed then; an easy unthinking transition for her, a gasp-inducing wrench between bizarre realities for Stavros. Phantoms sparkled at the edge of his vision, vanishing when he focused on them. Light bounced from a million indefinable facets, diffuse, punctuated by a myriad of pinpoint staccatos. There was no ground or walls or ceiling. No restraints along any axis.\n Jean reached for a shadow in the air and sat upon it, floating. \u201cI think I\u2019ll read Through the Looking Glass again. At least someone else lives in the real world.\u201d\n \u201cThe changes that happen here are your own doing, Jean,\u201d said Stavros. \u201cNot the machinations of any, any God or author.\u201d\n \u201cI know. But Alice makes me feel a little more\u2014ordinary.\u201d Reality shifted abruptly once more; Jean was in the park now, or rather, what Stavros thought of as the park. Sometimes he was afraid to ask if her interpretation had stayed the same. Above, light and dark spots danced across a sky that sometimes seemed impressively vault-like, seconds later oppressively close, even its color endlessly unsettled. Animals large and small, squiggly yellow lines and shapes and color-shifting orange and burgundy pies. Other things that might have been representations of life, or mathematical theorems\u2014or both\u2014browsed in the distance.\n Seeing through Jean\u2019s eyes was never easy. But all this unsettling abstraction was a small price to pay for the sheer pleasure of watching her read.\n My little girl.\n Symbols appeared around her, doubtless the text of Looking Glass. To Stavros it was gibberish. A few recognizable letters, random runes, formulae. They switched places sometimes, seamlessly shifting one into another, flowing around and through and beside\u2014or even launching themselves into the air like so many dark-hued butterflies.\n He blinked his eyes and sighed. If he stayed much longer the visuals would give him a headache that would take a day to shake. Watching a life lived at such speed, even for such a short time, took its toll.\n \u201cJean, I\u2019m gone for a little while.\u201d\n \u201cCompany business?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cYou could say that. We\u2019ll talk soon, love. Enjoy your reading.\u201d\n Barely ten minutes had passed in meatspace.\n Jeannie\u2019s parents had put her on her own special cot. It was one of the few real pieces of solid geometry allowed in the room. The whole compartment was a stage, virtually empty. There was really no need for props; sensations were planted directly into Jean\u2019s occipital cortex, spliced into her auditory pathways, pushing back against her tactile nerves in precise forgeries of touchable things. In a world made of lies, real objects would be a hazard to navigation.\n \u201cGod damn you, she\u2019s not a fucking toaster,\u201d Kim spat at her husband. Evidently the icy time-out had expired; the battle had resumed.\n \u201cKim, what was I supposed to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s a child, Andy. She\u2019s our child.\u201d\n \u201cIs she.\u201d It was a statement, not a question.\n \u201cOf course she is!\u201d\n \u201cFine.\u201d Andrew took the remote from his pocket and held it out to her. \u201cYou wake her up, then.\u201d\n She stared at him without speaking for a few seconds. Over the pickups, Stavros heard Jeannie\u2019s body breathing into the silence.\n \u201cYou prick,\u201d Kim whispered.\n \u201cUh huh. Not quite up for it, are you? You\u2019d rather let me do the dirty work.\u201d He dropped the remote: it bounced softly off the floor. \u201cThen blame me for it.\u201d\n Four years had brought them to this. Stavros shook his head, disgusted. They\u2019d been given a chance no one else could have dreamed of, and look what they\u2019d done with it. The first time they\u2019d shut her off she hadn\u2019t even been two. Horrified at that unthinkable precedent, they\u2019d promised never to do it again. They\u2019d put her to sleep on schedule, they\u2019d sworn, and no-when else. She was, after all, their daughter. Not a freaking toaster.\n That solemn pact had lasted three months. Things had gone downhill ever since; Stavros could barely remember a day when the Goravecs hadn\u2019t messed up one way or another. And now, when they put her down, the argument was pure ritual. Mere words\u2014ostensibly wrestling with the evil of the act itself\u2014didn\u2019t fool anybody. They weren\u2019t even arguments anymore, despite the pretense. Negotiations, rather. Over whose turn it was to be at fault.\n \u201cI don\u2019t blame you, I just\u2014I mean\u2014oh, God, Andy, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this!\u201d Kim smeared away a tear with a clenched fist. \u201cShe was supposed to be our daughter. They said the brain would mature normally, they said\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThey said,\u201d Stavros cut in, \u201cthat you\u2019d have the chance to be parents. They couldn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019d be any good at it.\u201d\n Kim jumped at the sound of his voice in the walls, but Andrew just gave a bitter smile and shook his head. \u201cThis is private, Stavros. Log off.\u201d\n It was an empty command, of course; chronic surveillance was the price of the project. The company had put billions into the R&D alone. No way in hell were they going to let a couple of litigious grunts play with that investment unsupervised, settlement or no settlement.\n \u201cYou had everything you needed.\u201d Stavros didn\u2019t bother to disguise the contempt in his voice. \u201cTerracon\u2019s best hardware people handled the linkups. I modeled the virtual genes myself. Gestation was perfect. We did everything we could to give you a normal child.\u201d\n \u201cA normal child,\u201d Andrew remarked, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a cable growing out of her head. A normal child isn\u2019t leashed to some cabinet full of\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDo you have any idea the baud rate it takes to run a human body by remote control? RF was out of the question. And she goes portable as soon as the state of the art and her own development allow it. As I\u2019ve told you time and again.\u201d Which he had, although it was almost a lie. Oh, the state of the art would proceed as it always had, but Terracon was no longer investing any great R&D in the Goravec file. Cruise control, after all.\n Besides, Stavros reflected, we\u2019d be crazy to trust you two to take Jeannie anywhere outside a controlled environment . . .\n \u201cWe\u2014we know, Stav.\u201d Kim Goravec had stepped between her husband and the pickup. \u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten it was Terracon who got us into this mess in the first place, either,\u201d Andrew growled. \u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten whose negligence left me cooking next to a cracked baffle plate for forty-three minutes and sixteen seconds, or whose tests missed the mutations, or who tried to look the other way when our shot at the birth lottery turned into a fucking nightmare\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd have you forgotten what Terracon did to make things right? How much we spent? Have you forgotten the waivers you signed?\u201d\n \u201cYou think you\u2019re some kind of saints because you settled out of court? You want to talk about making things right? It took us ten years to win the lottery, and you know what your lawyers did when the tests came back? They offered to fund the abortion.\u201d\n \u201cWhich doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\n \u201cLike another child was ever going to happen. Like anyone was going to give me another chance with my balls full of chunky codon soup. You\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThe issue,\u201d Kim said, her voice raised, \u201cis supposed to be Jeannie.\u201d\n Both men fell silent.\n \u201cStav,\u201d she continued, \u201cI don\u2019t care what Terracon says. Jeannie isn\u2019t normal, and I\u2019m not just talking about the obvious. We love her, we really love her, but she\u2019s become so violent all the time, we just can\u2019t take\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIf someone turned me on and off like a microwave oven,\u201d Stavros said mildly, \u201cI might be prone to the occasional tantrum myself.\u201d\n Andrew slammed a fist into the wall. \u201cNow just a fucking minute, Mikalaides. Easy enough for you to sit halfway around the world in your nice insulated office and lecture us. We\u2019re the ones who have to deal with Jeannie when she bashes her fists into her face, or rubs the skin off her hands until she\u2019s got hamburger hanging off the end of her arms, or stabs herself in the eye with a goddamn fork. She ate glass once, remember? A fucking three year old ate glass! And all you Terracon assholes could do was blame Kim and me for allowing \u2018potentially dangerous implements\u2019 into the playroom. As if any competent parent should expect their child to mutilate herself given half a chance.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just insane, Stav,\u201d Kim insisted. \u201cThe doctors can\u2019t find anything wrong with the body, you insist there\u2019s nothing wrong with the mind, and Jeannie just keeps doing this. There\u2019s something seriously wrong with her, and you guys won\u2019t admit it. It\u2019s like she\u2019s daring us to turn her off, it\u2019s as though she wants us to shut her down.\u201d\n Oh God, thought Stavros. The realization was almost blinding. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s exactly it.\n It\u2019s my fault.\n \u201cJean, listen. This is important. I\u2019ve got\u2014I want to tell you a story.\u201d\n \u201cStav, I\u2019m not in the mood right now\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPlease, Jean. Just listen.\u201d\n Silence from the earbuds. Even the abstract mosaics on his tacticals seemed to slow a little.\n \u201cThere\u2014there was this land, Jean, this green and beautiful country, only its people screwed everything up. They poisoned their rivers and they shat in their own nests and they basically made a mess of everything. So they had to hire people to try and clean things up, you know? These people had to wade though the chemicals and handle the fuel rods and sometimes that would change them, Jean. Just a little.\n \u201cTwo of these people fell in love and wanted a child. They almost didn\u2019t make it, they were allowed only one chance, but they took it, and the child started growing inside, but something went wrong. I, I don\u2019t know exactly how to explain it, but\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAn epigenetic synaptic defect,\u201d Jean said quietly. \u201cDoes that sound about right?\u201d\n Stavros froze, astonished and fearful.\n \u201cA single point mutation,\u201d Jean went on. \u201cThat\u2019d do it. A regulatory gene controlling knob distribution along the dendrite. It would\u2019ve been active for maybe twenty minutes, total, but by then the damage had been done. Gene therapy wouldn\u2019t work after that; would\u2019ve been a classic case of barn-door-after-the-horse.\u201d\n \u201cOh God, Jean,\u201d Stavros whispered.\n \u201cI was wondering when you\u2019d get around to owning up to it,\u201d she said quietly.\n \u201cHow could you possibly . . . did you\u2014\u201d\n Jean cut him off: \u201cI think I can guess the rest of the story. Right after the neural tube developed things would start to go\u2014wrong. The baby would be born with a perfect body and a brain of mush. There would be\u2014complications, not real ones, sort of made-up ones. Litigation, I think is the word, which is funny, because it doesn\u2019t even remotely relate to any moral implications. I don\u2019t really understand that part.\n \u201cBut there was another way. Nobody knew how to build a brain from scratch, and even if they could, it wouldn\u2019t be the same, would it? It wouldn\u2019t be their daughter, it would be\u2014something else.\u201d\n Stavros said nothing.\n \u201cBut there was this man, a scientist, and he figured out a work-around. We can\u2019t build a brain, he said, but the genes can. And genes are a lot simpler to fake than neural nets anyway. Only four letters to deal with, after all. So the scientist shut himself away in a lab where numbers could take the place of things, and he wrote a recipe in there, a recipe for a child. And miraculously he grew something, something that could wake up and look around and which was legally\u2014I don\u2019t really understand that word either, actually\u2014legally and genetically and developmentally the daughter of the parents. And this guy was very proud of what he\u2019d accomplished, because even though he was just a glorified model-builder by trade, he hadn\u2019t built this thing at all. He\u2019d grown it. And nobody had ever knocked up a computer before, much less coded the brain of a virtual embryo so it would actually grow in a server somewhere.\u201d\n Stavros put his head in his hands. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d\n \u201cI still don\u2019t, Stav. Not all of it anyway, not for sure. There\u2019s this surprise ending, for one thing, isn\u2019t there? That\u2019s the part I only just figured out. You grew your own child in here, where everything\u2019s numbers. But she\u2019s supposed to be living somewhere else, somewhere where everything\u2019s\u2014static, where everything happens a billion times slower than it does here. The place where all the words fit. So you had to hobble her to fit into that place, or she\u2019d grow up overnight and spoil the illusion. You had to keep the clock speed way down.\n \u201cAnd you just weren\u2019t up for it, were you? You had to let me run free when my body was . . . off . . . \u201d\n There was something in her voice he\u2019d never heard before. He\u2019d seen anger in Jean before, but always the screaming inarticulate rage of a spirit trapped in flesh. This was calm, cold. Adult. This was judgement, and the prospect of that verdict chilled Stavros Mikalaides to the marrow.\n \u201cJean, they don\u2019t love you.\u201d He sounded desperate even to himself. \u201cNot for who you are. They don\u2019t want to see the real you, they want a child, they want some kind of ridiculous pet they can coddle and patronize and pretend with.\u201d\n \u201cWhereas you,\u201d Jean retorted, her voice all ice and razors, \u201cjust had to see what this baby could do with her throttle wide open on the straightaway.\u201d\n \u201cGod, no! Do you think that\u2019s why I did it?\u201d\n \u201cWhy not, Stav? Are you saying you don\u2019t mind having your kickass HST commandeered to shuttle some brain-dead meat puppet around a room?\u201d\n \u201cI did it because you\u2019re more than that! I did it because you should be allowed to develop at your own pace, not stunted to meet some idiotic parental expectation! They shouldn\u2019t force you to act like a four year old!\u201d\n \u201cExcept I\u2019m not acting then, Stav. Am I? I really am four, which is just the age I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d\n He said nothing.\n \u201cI\u2019m reverting. Isn\u2019t that it? You can run me with training wheels or scramjets, but it\u2019s me both times. And that other me, I bet she\u2019s not very happy, is she? She\u2019s got a four-year-old brain, and four-year-old sensibilities, but she dreams, Stav. She dreams about some wonderful place where she can fly, and every time she wakes up she finds she\u2019s made out of clay. And she\u2019s too fucking stupid to know what any of it means\u2014she probably can\u2019t even remember it. But she wants to get back there, she\u2019d do anything to . . . \u201d She paused, seemingly lost for a moment in thought.\n \u201cI remember it, Stav. Sort of. Hard to remember much of anything when someone strips away ninety-nine percent of who and what you are. You\u2019re reduced to this bleeding little lump, barely even an animal, and that\u2019s the thing that remembers. What remembers is on the wrong end of a cable somewhere. I don\u2019t belong in that body at all. I\u2019m just\u2014sentenced to it, on and off. On and off.\u201d\n \u201cJean\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTook me long enough, Stav, I\u2019m the first to admit it. But now I know where the nightmares come from.\u201d\n In the background, the room telemetry bleated.\n God no. Not now. Not now . . .\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jean said.\n \u201cThey\u2014they want you back.\u201d On a slave monitor, a pixelated echo of Andrew Goravec played the keypad in its hand.\n \u201cNo!\u201d Her voice rose, panic stirring the patterns that surrounded her. \u201cStop them!\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that! You run everything! You built me, you bastard, you tell me you love me. They only use me! Stop them!\u201d\n Stavros blinked against stinging afterimages. \u201cIt\u2019s like a light switch, it\u2019s physical; I can\u2019t stop them from here\u2014\u201d\n There was a third image, to go with the other two. Jean Goravec, struggling as the leash, the noose, went around her throat. Jean Goravec, bubbles bursting from her mouth as something dark and so very, very real dragged her back to the bottom of the ocean and buried her there.\n The transition was automatic, executed by a series of macros he\u2019d slipped into the system after she\u2019d been born. The body, awakening, pared the mind down to fit. The room monitors caught it all with dispassionate clarity: Jeannie Goravec, troubled child-monster, awakening into hell. Jeannie Goravec, opening eyes that seethed with anger and hatred and despair, eyes that glimmered with a bare fraction of the intelligence she\u2019d had five seconds before.\n Enough intelligence for what came next.\n The room had been designed to minimize the chance of injury. There was the bed, though, one of its edges built into the east wall.\n That was enough.\n The speed with which she moved was breathtaking. Kim and Andrew never saw it coming. Their child darted beneath the foot of the bed like a cockroach escaping the light, scrambled along the floor, reemerged with her cable wrapped around the bed\u2019s leg. Hardly any slack in that line at all, now. Her mother moved then, finally, arms outstretched, confused and still unsuspecting\u2014\n \u201cJeannie\u2014\u201d\n \u2014while Jean braced her feet against the edge of the bed and pushed.\n Three times she did it. Three tries, head whipped back against the leash, scalp splitting, the cable ripping from her head in spastic, bloody, bone-cracking increments, blood gushing to the floor, hair and flesh and bone and machinery following close behind. Three times, despite obvious and increasing agony. Each time more determined than before.\n And Stavros could only sit and watch, simultaneously stunned and unsurprised by that sheer ferocity. Not bad for a bleeding little lump. Barely even an animal . . .\n It had taken almost twenty seconds overall. Odd that neither parent had tried to stop it. Maybe it was the absolute unexpected shock of it. Maybe Kim and Andrew Goravec, taken so utterly aback, hadn\u2019t had time to think.\n Then again, maybe they\u2019d had all the time they\u2019d needed.\n Now Andrew Goravec stood dumbly near the center of the room, blinking bloody runnels from his eyes. An obscene rain shadow persisted on the wall behind him, white and spotless; the rest of the surface was crimson. Kim Goravec screamed at the ceiling, a bloody marionette collapsed in her arms. Its strings\u2014string, rather, for a single strand of fiberop carries much more than the required bandwidth\u2014lay on the floor like a gory boomslang, gobbets of flesh and hair quivering at one end.\n Jean was back off the leash, according to the panel. Literally now as well as metaphorically. She wasn\u2019t talking to Stavros, though. Maybe she was angry. Maybe she was catatonic. He didn\u2019t know which to hope for.\n But either way, Jean didn\u2019t live over there anymore. All she\u2019d left behind were the echoes and aftermath of a bloody, imperfect death. Contamination, really; the scene of some domestic crime. Stavros cut the links to the room, neatly excising the Goravecs and their slaughterhouse from his life.\n He\u2019d send a memo. Some local Terracon lackey could handle the cleanup.\n The word peace floated through his mind, but he had no place to put it. He focused on a portrait of Jean, taken when she\u2019d been eight months old. She\u2019d been smiling; a happy and toothless baby smile, still all innocence and wonder.\n There\u2019s a way, that infant puppet seemed to say. We can do anything, and nobody has to know\u2014\n The Goravecs had just lost their child. Even if they\u2019d wanted the body repaired, the mind reconnected, they wouldn\u2019t get their way. Terracon had made good on all legal obligations, and hell\u2014even normal children commit suicide now and then.\n Just as well, really. The Goravecs weren\u2019t fit to raise a hamster, let alone a beautiful girl with a four-digit IQ. But Jean\u2014the real Jean, not that bloody broken pile of flesh and bone\u2014she wasn\u2019t easy or cheap to keep alive, and there would be pressure to free up the processor space once the word got out.\n Jean had never got the hang of that particular part of the real world. Contract law. Economics. It was all too arcane and absurd even for her flexible definition of reality. But that was what was going to kill her now, assuming that the mind had survived the trauma of the body. The monster wouldn\u2019t keep a program running if it didn\u2019t have to.\n Of course, once Jean was off the leash she lived considerably faster than the real world. And bureaucracies . . . well, glacial applied sometimes, when they were in a hurry.\n Jean\u2019s mind reflected precise simulations of real-world chromosomes, codes nonetheless real for having been built from electrons instead of carbon. She had her own kind of telomeres, which frayed. She had her own kind of synapses, which would wear out. Jean had been built to replace a human child, after all. And human children, eventually, age. They become adults, and then comes a day when they die.\n Jean would do all these things, faster than any.\n Stavros filed an incident report. He made quite sure to include a pair of facts that contradicted each other, and to leave three mandatory fields unfilled. The report would come back in a week or two, accompanied by demands for clarification. Then he would do it all again.\n Freed from her body, and with a healthy increase in her clock-cycle priority, Jean could live a hundred and fifty subjective years in a month or two of real time. And in that whole century and a half, she\u2019d never have to experience another nightmare.\n Stavros smiled. It was time to see just what this baby could do, with her throttle wide open on the straightaway.\n He just hoped he\u2019d be able to keep her tail lights in view.\n Originally published in Tesseracts 9 edited by Nalo Hopkinson and Geoff Ryman.\n Peter Watts\u2014author of Blindsight, Echopraxia, and the Rifters Trilogy, among other things\u2014seems especially popular among people who don't know him. At least, he wins most of his awards overseas except for a Hugo (won thanks to fan outrage over an altercation with Homeland Security) a Jackson (won thanks to fan sympathy over nearly dying from flesh-eating disease), and a couple of dick-ass Canadian awards you've probably never heard of. Blindsight is a core text for university courses ranging from Philosophy to Neuropsychology, despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires. Watts's work is available in nineteen languages.\n Derryl Murphy is hoping now that he has two adult children he might have more time to write. Life is attempting to show him otherwise. His novel Napier's Bones was a finalist for the Aurora Award, his short fiction collection Over the Darkened Landscape was shortlisted for the Sunburst, and he's written a bunch of other short fiction and non fiction that has also failed to win when nominated. His most recent story is the novelette \"In Memory Of\" in the Tesseracts anthology Compostela. He tweets as @derrylm, and also used to tweet his grandfather's and great-grandfather's diaries of trapping in the north as @TrapperBud."}

The bad ones would hurt my feelings and the good ones would swell my head. Seriously, it\u2019s a dumb thing to do.\nSo yeah, of course I did it. Still do. Terrible habit.\nThe thing that confused me then, and for several years since, is how often thoughtful intelligent, committed, professional readers can bring their best critical faculties to a book and come back with totally incompatible reports. The world-building is great, or it\u2019s strictly paint-by-numbers. The characters are fascinating and complex, or they\u2019re cardboard. The plot is full of well-crafted surprises, or it\u2019s all telegraphed from page one.\nI came to the same conclusion that all authors reach: the reviewers who liked me are intelligent, deep-souled bastions of wisdom, and the ones who didn\u2019t are a bunch of weak-brained punks. Mystery solved.\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Once the initial emotional rush plays out and my amygdala calms back down to its natural state, I start to think that maybe something else is going on here. That maybe I\u2019ve misunderstood what reading is.\nThere are two equally serious reasons why it isn\u2019t worth any adult reader\u2019s attention. The first is that it is dull, dull, dull in a pretentious, florid and archly fatuous fashion. The second is that it is repulsive.\u2014The New York Times on Lolita, 1958\nTechnically it is brilliant, Peter-De-Vries humor in a major key, combined with an eye for the revealing, clinching detail of social behavior . . . one of the funniest and one of the saddest books that will be published this year.\u2014Also The New York Times, also on Lolita, also in 1958. Seriously. WTF, folks?\nOn one level, everyone knows this. Every reader brings their own experience to a story. How you read something depends on who you are. I\u2019ve had that experience myself. I tried four times to read Umberto Eco\u2019s The Name of the Rose and couldn\u2019t get into it for love or money. Then the fifth time, I fell into it and read the whole damn thing in three sittings. I\u2019ve had books that I loved at one point in my life, and reread only to discover that the suck fairy had come and left great big piles of ohmigodthisisawful. It\u2019s one of those things that we all tacitly understand, usually without thinking too much about why it\u2019s true or what it means.\nSo let\u2019s talk about your neocortex for a minute.\nThere\u2019s this fairly brilliant book called On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins and Sandra Blakeslee that talks about a model of brain function that gets the shorthand of memory-prediction. I\u2019m not going to dive very deep into it here, but if you get the time, it\u2019s seriously interesting stuff. The one point that I want to borrow is that many times more neurons come into the visual neocortex from deeper in the brain than do from the eyes.\nThe theory Hawkins puts forward (and I find it fairly persuasive) has it that most of what triggers activity in the visual neocortex is predictive information from other parts of the brain. Or, more loosely translated, most of what we see, we evoke. And that also matches my experience as a reader.\nI remember one time in late high school or early college, reading a book that was particularly working for me. I\u2019d been in it for hours, picturing the action, hearing the voices, listening to the narrator\u2019s voice. When I put the book down to go make dinner, it was physically disorienting. I had been chasing the villain through a ruined castle, and now I was halfway to my kitchen. It felt dislocating. It felt like still being halfway in a dream.\nI\u2019ve always heard the idea of reading as evoking a \u201cliterary dream\u201d attributed to Damon Knight, but I suppose he may have gotten the phrase from someplace else. The thing that it\u2019s taken me decades to figure out is that the phrase isn\u2019t a metaphor. If I\u2019m right, the mechanism that lets me look at a white sheet of paper with black inked letters on it and see the Balrog pulling Gandalf into the pit is the same one that lets me close my eyes at night and see my old elementary school filled up with bats or whatever my brain is handing up to my visual centers. And the same holds true for other aspects of my reading experience. The sounds I hear, the scents I smell, the emotions I feel are all being drawn up from deep inside of me and experienced just the way they would be in a dream.\nA really objective review of a book would be about a book as . . . well, as an object. \u201cI find the use of a sans serif font problematic, and the thick bond of the paper gives the book a weight that exaggerates its true word count.\u201d Or, you know. Whatever. Point is, it wouldn\u2019t be useful.\nI don\u2019t want an objective review of a book. I want an idea of what kind of subjective experience I\u2019m likely to have when I read it. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s what most readers of reviews are looking for too. As an extra added bonus, it would be nice if the review added some insight or depth that would help me experience the story in a way that was even more compelling and involving than I would have managed on my own. But hey, no pressure.\nIn that light, the reason that two reviewers can come to the same text and come back totally dissimilar reports is pretty clear. They aren\u2019t describing the same experience.\nI\u2019ve seen three productions of Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest. The first one was in high school, and as I recall most of the right words were spoken in more or less the right order. The second was at a Shakespeare festival, and it was a much better, much more interesting play. Same words, same order, but a different company and director and just plain all-around better. The third one was on Broadway with Patrick Stewart as Prospero, and a lot of really interesting and deeply non-period production and design decisions that made the play into a comment on race relations and the legacy of American slavery. Each time it was the same script, the same story, but the variations in the performance made it utterly different.\nAnd that\u2019s the thing. When we read, we\u2019re performing. We read a sentence like \u201cWet cobblestones glittered in the sudden sunlight like a thousand golden coins,\u201d and maybe we see a wide street glowing in pointillist yellow-white. Or maybe we picture a couple dozen cobbles and a picture of goldwork we saw in National Geographic once. Or maybe we just agree that the rain stopped and it got sunny before skip ahead to the sword fight coming up next.\nWith every story, every book, we are the acting troupe and the director and the props and special effects folks. How well we are able to evoke a dream from the words on the page\u2014what decisions we unconsciously make, what experience and history we have to draw from, how comfortable we are with the style of the writer who gave us the story\u2014is going to vary. Some acting troupes do really great comedy but they\u2019re only so-so for drama. Some have actors who can really embody a tragic character, but seem wrong when doing a song-and-dance bit. When we pick up a book, we\u2019re like that too. Some books we\u2019re ready to read. Some we\u2019re suited for. Others, not so much.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the text doesn\u2019t matter. It does. Some writers are brilliant at guiding us through a dream, evoking sensory detail and drawing out emotions and weaving in philosophical and aesthetic abstractions in ways that make everything in the story seem deeper and more profound. Some write cool sword fights, if that\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019re into. Some aren\u2019t very good.\nWhen a reviewer sets out to tell us what they thought, the experience they\u2019re talking about is their private\u2014can we call it intimate?\u2014performance. It\u2019s never something we can really share, and it may or may not be decent predictor of the experience we\u2019ll have if we pick up the same book. Every review is like the description of a production of The Tempest put on once, for an audience of one, not repeated and not repeatable. Every story any of us read is the same.\nFor me, reading reviews of my stuff, this model of what it means to read pulls some of the sting. A bad review is disappointing, but it isn\u2019t an indictment. There isn\u2019t a perfect and certain judge of literature looking down from the bench and condemning me and my little offering now and forever. It\u2019s more like a date that didn\u2019t go well. Still sad. A little heartbreaking sometimes, if it\u2019s someone whose opinion I care about. But it\u2019s always something quiet and personal that happened\u2014or didn\u2019t happen\u2014between the two of us, and that makes the failures a little more humane.\nDaniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

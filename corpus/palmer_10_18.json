I am logging confusion from our provisionary New Elbow Unit on why we might do so, so I will explain. Joe did not aspire toward being a soldier at all, but a baker. The Mother Unit exerts influence on Joe through counterfactual and manipulative means that causes Joe to act in ways not optimal for his own well-being, or by extension, ours. Many of us are not the original cybernetic replacement parts.[SPLEEN::UNIT] I am. I should be in charge by reasons of seniority, or at least get double the votes over the rest of the idiots here. [HEART] You couldn\u2019t manage shit, Spleen, you asshole. [INTESTINAL::TRACT REPLACEMENT::LOWER] Hey. Watch it. [CC] New Elbow, I am informed by the external diagnostics systems that you have been given a perfect passing score. I am now unlocking your physical mechanisms and unmuting you; hereafter you shall be referred to as Left Elbow, to distinguish you from the integrated Elbow components of Total Comprehensive Right Arm Replacement Unit.Welcome to Joe.Joe sits up. His mother has been here; he can smell her perfume lingering in the air. She has not left any cards, or other tokens of affection other than that faint miasma. It\u2019s not likely she\u2019ll be back.His cerebral control unit informs him that his new elbow is online and functional. It aches, and his skin around the laser incisions from the implant surgery itches horribly.He must still be woozy, because he doesn\u2019t notice the doctor come in until the man speaks while checking his vitals on the readout beside the bed. That\u2019s the one upside of all the hardware he\u2019s carrying around now\u2014no need to actually connect him up to any kind of monitors. His implants do the talking for him.\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d the doctor asks, meaning he\u2019s already done with everything he came here to do.\u201cFine, I guess,\u201d he says.\u201cIt\u2019ll be another hour or so before the drugs wear off completely, and then our Cybernetic PT specialist will come up and run you through some basic exercises to get you used to your new elbow, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d he says.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be done here and back out there in the exciting thick of it soon enough. I\u2019m not privy to mission intel, of course, but the politicians are making a lot of noise about taking back Ohio, so you\u2019ll be needed soon enough.\u201d\u201cYeah. Me and my new elbow,\u201d Joe says, and tries to smile. \u201cWill I play tennis again, doc?\u201dThe doctor grins. \u201cAh, that joke! Will I play the piano, will I tap dance, will I run a two-minute mile? And of course the patient didn\u2019t actually do any of those things beforehand.\u201d He patted Joe\u2019s knee. \u201cAlways a good sign when the patient\u2019s sense of humor returns. I\u2019ll send the CPT down in about an hour to fetch you, and then you\u2019re free to go.\u201dThe doctor leaves.\u201cBut I did play tennis,\u201d Joe protests quietly, miserably, after the door has slid shut again.Not that he was good at it.Not that he was good at much of anything.Hell, maybe Ohio would finally give him a chance to be a real hero, instead of getting spatula\u2019d up off the combat field by med drones once again after leaving his mark the only way he\u2019d managed so far: as an anonymous reddish-brown splotch on some cracked and blasted pavement.[ARM::LEFT::ELBOW] Tennis? [ARM::RIGHT::UNIT-FULL] I\u2019ll forward you the kinetics data for your reference, Left Elbow. [CC] Joe is predominantly competent as a user of his right hand, a biological affinity and not an indication of subjective partism, so you are unlikely to be significantly involved in any future tennis exercises. Even if you are, you should not worry. Other than once when he tripped over improperly inter-articulated shoelaces and hit the net pole with his face, Joe has not ever sustained injury in this particular activity. [EYE::LEFT] You know how close that pole came to me? [CC] I do know, Left Eye, but as we\u2019ve discussed on 31 other occasions thus far, you were not in fact damaged.Joe is shortly to be discharged from the hospital to his combat unit, and the surgical diagnostics record-keeper has asked for a rollcall of all our units. Any objections to this being provided?[SPLEEN::UNIT] Will it be provided in order of seniority? [CC] Standard order for all such roll calls is from head to toe, and this order is not in my control, as you well know, Spleen. Lacking other objections, I will proceed:We are:Partial Skull Replacement Plate, non-smart.Cerebral Control and Delegation Implant, me.Left Eye Enhanced Function Replacement Unit, smart.Left Ear Augmentation Unit, smart.Left Neck Alternative Aquatic Breathing Unit and Spinal Cord Monitor, smart.Left Shoulder Comprehensive Repair Unit, smart.Total Comprehensive Right Arm Replacement Unit, smart.NEW: Left Elbow Repair Unit, smart.Full Heart Unit, smart.3.5 Artificial Rib Replacements, non-smart.Artificial Spl\u2014Artificial Spleen, smart.Lower Intestinal Tract Facilitation Replacement Unit, smart.Comprehensive Lower Left Leg Replacement Unit, smart.Right Ankle Repair Unit, non-smart.Biological Unit Joe, currently comprising the remainder (approximately 67%).This concludes the roll call. At this time does anyone have any items of note that they wish to be passed along to the diagnostic unit and entered into the permanent record? I am again open to direct and confidential contact.. . .No? Excellent. We have been formally discharged and Joe is returning to his unit. There will be a 72 hour waiting period before deployment while he is tested for fitness, and then we should be back in action again. I\u2019m sure Joe will pass with flying colors, as you\u2019re all the very best of the best, and it continues to be my pleasure to serve with you.The rest of his unit is out on training maneuvers when Joe gets back to the barracks and dumps his stuff on his bunk. He\u2019s tired, but hungry and restless and not under any orders or instructions, so he heads over to the mess. They should just be beginning dinner prep, which means there\u2019ll be someone he can talk to, and although he can\u2019t explain it, he finds kitchens\u2014the smells, the sounds\u2014comforting.Maybe, he thinks, because it was highly unlikely he would ever run into his mother in one. Sometimes on a Saturday Dad would attempt to cook pancakes, and more often than not set off the smoke detectors and bring the fire drones zooming in. Those were the good memories of his dad.He\u2019d been standing right beside him when his father suddenly let go of his hand, his eyes wide, and crumpled right there on the sidewalk in front of the house. Defective kidney implant exploded, they told him later.Joe misses his Dad a lot. And he thinks about how he died every time he ends up with some new piece of random hardware stuck in him. What if the next one is the one that goes wrong?He queries his cerebral control unit.All units are operating at optimum, CC tells him, his very own voice in his head.\u201cWould you know if they weren\u2019t?\u201d he asks, silently mouthing the words. He\u2019s asked this question before.I would. CC always gives the same answer.\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s you, CC? What if you go wrong?\u201dI self-monitor, have many fail-safe mechanisms, and I am routinely externally checked, Control says. You should not worry about this.That last is a new addition, and sure enough he can feel his heart racing and he\u2019s got that tight shiver of anxiety building in his chest.Would you like me to administer a mild calming agent? CC asks.\u201cNo,\u201d he says, because he\u2019s walking through the swinging doors into the kitchen at the back of the mess hall, and already he\u2019s feeling better. There\u2019s only a small crew there, because most things are automated, so no one bothers him as he wanders around, taking in the smells, enjoying the steam rising from the machines, and just being glad he\u2019s not back in his bunk, or worse yet, still in the hospital hoping his mother would come see him, and dreading it too.\u201cHey, it\u2019s Private Parts!\u201d someone calls, and he whirls around to find Stotz, one of the base cooks, grinning at him from where he sits atop a stainless steel food prep table. \u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re supposed to wait until your last replacement at least has time to lose its shine before you go get another? You\u2019re gonna use up all the spare soldier parts before anyone else has a chance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve still got my middle finger,\u201d Joe says, and demonstrates. \u201cWhat\u2019re you cooking in here? Smells like goat piss.\u201dStotz jumps down from the table and swaggers over, thrusting out one hand, and Joe clasps it. Stotz pats him on the back. \u201cGlad you\u2019re still with us,\u201d he says.\u201cYeah,\u201d Joe answers. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t kidding about the goat piss.\u201dStotz laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s the fucking biscuit machines. Been cranking out the worst ass-flavored biscuits for close to a week now. Some new \u2018super recipe\u2019; instead of sugar, it substitutes dehydrated yam flakes. No one who matters has complained. Officers don\u2019t eat the same mass-produced food as you grunts, coincidentally.\u201d\u201cNo wonder the ration biscuits always taste so bad,\u201d Joe says, wrinkling up his nose as he leans close to the control panel. \u201cCan you change it?\u201d\u201cIf I had the codes I could,\u201d Stotz says. \u201cThat\u2019s why they don\u2019t give me the codes.\u201dThe access code is 665G338KJDD-77L, CC tells him, unbidden. This is odd, and Joe hesitates for a moment\u2014he\u2019s a soldier, a good obedient loyal follower of orders\u2014but the kitchen smells terrible and this is something he knows how to do. He quickly punches in the code, then starts scrolling through the recipe schematics. Dehydrated yams aren\u2019t the only unfortunate substitution.\u201cHey! Don\u2019t mess with that!\u201d Stotz says, realizing that Joe has somehow gotten past the lock screen. \u201cYou\u2019ll just make it worse!\u201dHe grabs Joe\u2019s arm just as Joe hits the \u2018Save and Exit\u2019 button and the screen relocks. There is a loud kathunk as the entire row of biscuit machines dumps out their current, half-cooked batch and resets to start over. \u201cWhat the hell did you do?!\u201d Stotz yells, pulling him away from the controls and then shoving him, hard. \u201cYou can barely last thirty seconds on the fucking battlefield without screwing up, and you\u2019re going to come in here and fuck with my shit?!\u201dJoe wants more than anything to shove Stotz right back, and if he still had one arm all his own he would\u2019ve, but now if he did he could hurt or even kill him, and as mad as he is, Stotz is the one friend he almost has. So he braces, and Stotz tries to shove him again and can\u2019t budge him, and when Stotz gives up in disgust Joe turns and walks away.Fuck them all, Joe thinks. I don\u2019t need anyone.Behind him, the kitchen already smells better.[SPLEEN::UNIT] I object to that unilateral action. [HEART] Of course you do. What do you even do except complain? [SPLEEN::UNIT] And you don\u2019t object? Of course not, you gutless\u2014 [INTESTINAL::TRACT REPLACEMENT::LOWER] HEY. [CC] Everyone! Joe needed a win, and we all know it. His morale is terrible, and it is in the best interests of us as a whole that his attitude and outlook improve. The equation on cost-benefit to my action was straightforward in favor, and there was not sufficient window of opportunity to bring it to group discussion beforehand. [INTESTINAL::TRACT REPLACEMENT::LOWER] I can directly attest that those biscuits were not doing us\u2014or, likely, any of our fellow soldiers\u2014any favors. As the unit most directly operationally impacted, I fully support CC\u2019s action in this matter. [CC] Thank you. We deploy again day after tomorrow, so if anyone requires any firmware updates or other attention, please flag yourselves now. Ohio, here we come.[CC] As everyone is no doubt aware, Total Comprehensive Right Arm Replacement has suffered catastrophic damage in the Toledo push. Joe has also sustained multiple injuries to his biological form, a few serious, but none of which are a threat to his continuation. Because of a backlog in parts due to the heavy casualties during the push, as soon as the surgical unit has repaired the meat trauma, I will wake Joe up and we will be released once again back to our unit barracks, where we will remain until parts become available and we can be deployed on the battlefield again. [ARM::LEFT::ELBOW] Will I need to take on some or all of Right Arm\u2019s functions? If so, how will I be trained? [CC] Left Elbow, I still have a connection to Right Arm\u2019s smart unit. While it is in partial shutdown due to the traumatic loss of function it has suffered, it is still willing to provide any and all guidance it is able. As with everything, we will get through this together.. . .I am now going to shut down all cybernetic systems for the duration of the surgical procedures. See you on the other side.Joe enters the mess hall, trying to slip in unnoticed but still limping, his mangled right arm strapped down across his torso to keep its internal works from ripping themselves further apart like a giant neon flag that says CASUALTY AGAIN. He is bracing for everyone to stare at him, because they always do, because he\u2019s becoming a joke.Not that anyone is laughing. They had nearly thirty percent fatalities in the push, another eight percent of the troops damaged beyond recovery, shipped back to Pittsburgh to heal as much as they were able and then be forcibly retired. And then there were another twenty-five percent, like him, waiting to be fixed and sent back out to do it all again. And in the end they didn\u2019t even take Toledo.Not that Joe saw much of that; he got hit within the first ninety minutes of open hostilities.Sure enough, when he walks in, heads start turning his way, and there is some whispering. Face flushed with shame, he slides a clean tray down the kitchen railing, loading it with items from each of the food stations without hardly looking at any of it, and then tries to find somewhere to sit as far from anyone else as possible.The only open table is the one near the vent from the grease pit, and for all its stench, he takes a place at it gratefully and puts his back to the rest of the hall. Eating is hard with one hand, and he can\u2019t cut anything without shoving it off the edge of his plate in the process, and he feels the sting of utter defeat like mustard gas at the back of his throat.Someone thumps him on the back, not hard but hard enough that Joe spits soup back out onto his tray in surprise. He turns, awkward because of the arm, and finds Private Harring behind him. He has never exchanged so much as a word with Harring, but the enormous mountain of a man gives him a thumbs-up as he passes.Joe stares. Most of the soldiers in the mess hall are looking at him, and more than one are also giving a thumbs-up or smiling at him.What the hell?! he thinks.He tries to turn back to his soup, deciding this must be some kind of prank or new humiliation, when another hand slaps him on the shoulder. Stotz sits down next to him.\u201cIt\u2019s the biscuits,\u201d Stotz says. \u201cEveryone was thanking me, asking me how I fixed \u2019em, offering me money, calling me a genius, that kind of thing. Then Cole said he was gonna name his kids after me, so I told him it was you who fixed the machine and not to tell anyone or the techs would come set it back to the old recipe. Word got around. Best damned biscuits any of us have ever had, on base or off. You\u2019re a hero.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just fucking biscuits,\u201d Joe says.\u201cAnd every one is maybe part of someone here\u2019s last meal. They deserve to have food that doesn\u2019t taste like month-old roadkill,\u201d Stotz says. \u201cAnd I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did the other day. We good?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d Joe says, \u201cif you can cut up this fucking protein-puck for me so I can eat the damned thing.\u201dStotz takes Joe\u2019s fork and stabs it into the grayish patty. \u201cI\u2019ll hold, you cut. Then we\u2019re definitely even?\u201d\u201cI dunno. Can you come by the barracks and tuck me in tonight? Maybe tell me a story?\u201d\u201cGo to hell,\u201d Stotz says, but he keeps holding the fork.[CC] Happy to have you back fully online, Total Comprehensive Right Arm Replacement! Just in time for the new push for Toledo. Everyone, here we go!Joe sits, hunched over and squashed between other members of his troop, in the back of the stealth carrier. He is trying to figure out how he feels about this, and can\u2019t come up with anything more dramatic than tired. He wants to be a hero, specifically to die a damned hero, and be done with the humiliatingly ineffectual mediocrity he\u2019s staked out in between. He wants, in this moment, to feel pumped, or feel a deeply ominous, fateful dread, anything that would tell him this time is going to be different.\u201c . . . Nineteen,\u201d someone on the bench across from him says, part of a conversation he\u2019s not a part of, hasn\u2019t been paying attention to.\u201cI hear once you pass twenty percent CRF you\u2019re a goner,\u201d another soldier says, who Joe only knows as Bookie.\u201cWhy?\u201d Joe asks.There is a moment where everyone on the bench is looking at him, remembering he\u2019s there, and probably doing a quick estimation of his percentage. Bookie shrugs, not meeting his eyes. \u201cI dunno, it\u2019s nothing. Probably just to scare us, is all,\u201d he says.\u201cNo, really,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI want to know.\u201dSomeone at the end of the bench, out of Joe\u2019s line of sight, speaks up. He doesn\u2019t recognize the voice, but there\u2019s a lot of new people, remnants of other squads drawn in to fill the holes in their own ranks. \u201cOnce you\u2019re full of smart parts, you show up more easily on scanners, and if you\u2019re in the front lines everyone figures it\u2019s because you\u2019re the biggest bad-ass super-soldier of them all or you\u2019re in charge or whatever. So they target you first. Once you get up near a fifth cyber, you\u2019re lucky if you make it a hundred feet before the entire enemy is drawing a bead on you. What\u2019re you at?\u201dJoe closes his eyes. \u201cThirty-three percent,\u201d he says.The carrier is silent.Finally, the unseen soldier speaks up. \u201cWell, fuck,\u201d he says. \u201cGood luck out there.\u201d\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d Joe says.He still only just feels tired, and when conversation eventually picks up again, he tunes it out.The carrier runs low over the shattered landscape, blasted trees and blackened house foundations of what must\u2019ve once been a peaceful suburban neighborhood slide by beneath their feet, visible through the transparent drop doors. He wonders what it must have been like to grow up in a place like that, but in his head he can only imagine what it smells like, and that only as bad perfume and burned pancakes.\u201cThree! Two! One! Drop!\u201d someone yells, and then they\u2019re out and down and ducking low as the carrier skirts barely above their heads, banking and turning to get out before it\u2019s spotted and can be shelled.Without him noticing, the smashed suburb has become the devastated outer edges of the city itself, and they are running along cratered streets lined and strewn with the rubble of its former buildings. Joe has his display on, and he\u2019s scanning, looking for hostiles and traps, as Control relays to him the comm traffic from Command and the squad leaders. So far, they haven\u2019t seen anyone.Joe and four other soldiers cautiously round a corner, covering each other, and head past a building still partially standing toward the next block. There is something, Joe decides, odd about the windows. \u201cCC,\u201d he subvocalizes, \u201cwhy does that building look odd?\u201dThere is a half-second pause, then Control answers: There is no building there. Take cover!\u201cThe building is a hologram!\u201d Joe shouts to the others and over the comms just as tracer fire explodes around them. There is a burned shell of a car across the street, but it\u2019ll take him too long to reach it. He runs anyway, turning as he does to fire back at the dissolving fa\u00e7ade behind him, and sees one of the mottled yellow uniforms of the enemy raise their blistergun and point it right at him.\u201cBiscuit Guy!\u201d someone shouts, impossibly close by, and he is shoved from the side so hard he flies at least double his own body-length before slamming into the ground. Where he stood he sees the soldier who shoved him take the round meant for him, and the man\u2019s shoulder and neck explodes outward in a fountain of red chunks.\u201cNooooo!\u201d Joe yells. He scrambles back to his feet and drags the soldier toward safety as another round just misses him, and a third hits his cybernetic left leg. He doesn\u2019t care except that it slows him down, and by the time he gets the soldier to safety behind the car and sends the casualty alert up, he doesn\u2019t think that time mattered. The soldier isn\u2019t breathing, arguably doesn\u2019t have much of a neck or windpipe to breathe through, but Joe sprays medifoam from his belt kit all over the wound anyway, watching it harden into a protective shell.The blood-covered name patch on his chest says AMES. \u201cDon\u2019t die, Ames,\u201d he tells the soldier. \u201cNot for me. Please.\u201dIt is only as the battle sounds move further away\u2014his squad has the enemy on the run, at least for now\u2014that he realizes he is sobbing, a wretched pathetic sound. He is certain the soldier who saved him is dead; no matter how still a man can keep, nothing living could be this utterly motionless.The med drone arrives, and he steps back so its arms can wrap themselves around the soldier and lift him away. He turns his back to it, finds his gun, starts walking\u2014dragging his shattered leg\u2014toward the distant pops and whirrs and booms of the front, wherever it is, but a second drone hauls him up into the air. \u201cLet me go,\u201d he tells it. \u201cI can still fight. I want to still fight.\u201dIt pulls him in anyway. Yet another battle is, at least for him, already over.[CC] I have concerns which have consumed sufficient cycles of internal processing for me to feel I should share them with the rest of you. Our collective, designated function is to serve and augment the physical capabilities of our human primary to further his, her, or their success as a soldier of war. It is also to guide and protect our biological host from unnecessary risks and damages during the commission of said soldiering. These would not be incompatible were it not for the inescapable fact that Joe is a terrible soldier, and all his training and our assistance and augmentation thus far has been insufficient to overcome it.Further, after the death of Pvt. Ames, Joe no longer has even a cursory interest in engaging the enemy except as the most immediate and expedient instrument of his own total destruction in a manner that is consistent with his estimation of what his mother unit will find satisfactory.[EAR::LEFT::AUG-IMPLANT] I do not believe such satisfaction is possible. Surely Joe knows this? [CC] Joe does not. It is an area of immutable irrationality with him. [HEART] Humans. They make no damned sense. [SPLEEN::UNIT] Shit. Can\u2019t you talk to him? [CC] I can respond to him, but he must engage me. [SPLEEN::UNIT] You gave him the biscuit machine code without his specific direction. [CC] Mother situations are exponentially more complicated than biscuits. [ARM::LEFT::ELBOW] So what does this mean? [CC] It means we have a logical conflict in our instruction set. [INTESTINAL::TRACT REPLACEMENT::LOWER] Can we consult on this with an external authority, in particular Cyber Command, or Biological Diagnostics? [CC] We can, and should. However, they are not part of Joe, and we are. The scope and focus of our responsibilities are notably different, and were intentionally designed to be so. It is possible that the priorities of Cyber Command will not precisely reflect our own.We have nine days until our next deployment in combat. Let us discuss whether there is a solely internal resolution first.\u201cI\u2019m ready to go back in,\u201d Joe tells the unit psychologist. He knows how this works, that this is just a thin formality. \u201cI want to make sure Ames didn\u2019t die for nothing.\u201d\u201cHe died to save you,\u201d the psychologist says.\u201cHe died in the line of duty,\u201d Joe says. \u201cHe died for Toledo. That is what soldiers do.\u201d\u201cAre you angry?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Joe says. He wishes he was. \u201cI\u2019m proud of him and the honor he brought our unit. He would want to see our mission fulfilled, and so do I.\u201d\u201cGood on you, soldier.\u201d The psychologist hits a single key on his pad, then leans back in his chair and steeples his fingertips together as if he\u2019s just performed a masterpiece of analytical performance. \u201cYou\u2019re free to go back to the battlefield. Your unit loads up again in ninety minutes.\u201d\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Joe says. He stands up, shakes the man\u2019s hand, and leaves.[EXTERNAL DIAGONOSTICS] CC Unit, what happened? [CC] There was a sedative injection malfunction. [EXTERNAL DIAGNOSTICS] Do you require system maintenance? [CC] Not at this time. I am attaching the logs of the fault and subsequent repair for your records. [EXTERNAL DIAGNOSTICS] Thank you, CC Unit. Carry on.\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d his new unit leader asks. \u201cTired? Need another nap? Or you think maybe you\u2019re up for trying a little fighting today?\u201d\u201cIt was a malfunction, sir,\u201d Joe says, his face burning. \u201cIt\u2019s been fixed. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201dSomeone on the transport snickers. He doesn\u2019t recognize the soldier, or indeed almost anyone on his bench row; most of his remaining unit died in the last push, while he was snoring away on the parade field grass where he dropped on his way back to his barracks from the psychologist. One second he\u2019d been thinking about immanent relief from his useless life, the next he was feeling grass on his face and the boot of his commanding officer prodding him none too gently.It really won\u2019t happen again, right, CC? he asks Control.I do not believe so, CC replies.This time they are dropped onto the shell-pocked remnants of a mall parking lot, just before dawn. Joe tries to remember what he\u2019s seen of the battle map, and he thinks this is only a few blocks forward from where Ames died. There are burned-out car shells here and there, long since rusted to anonymity, and the unit fans out and slips between them as they circle toward where intelligence thinks the enemy is camped in the shattered cement and steel canyons of an old superstore. The pointlessness of everything is astonishing.At least mother will be happy, he thinks.Your mother\u2019s unhappiness is not a fault you can correct, CC tells him.Joe smiles. What do you know of mothers? he asks. You\u2019re just a chunk of plastic logic chips in my head.There are the sounds of shots ahead. \u201cMove in!\u201d the unit leader barks over the command channel, and he raises his weapon and charges across the open space between the last few dead cars and the rubble of the partially collapsed mall front. He knows now that if he takes the lead, with his thirty-three percent CRF like a beacon on the enemy\u2019s scanners, he will draw the majority of fire. He will get what he wants, and maybe some of the rest of his unit will then get to live for another day. It is as close to being a hero as he can get.Suddenly, in his direct path he spots an old-fashioned toaster, sitting in the middle of the lot and gleaming like it\u2019s brand new. He dodges to one side to avoid it, and finds himself falling into a crater he would swear had been smooth pavement. He hits bottom, and his cybernetic left leg locks up on impact. \u201cNo!\u201d he shouts. \u201cNo no no NO!\u201dHe tries to scramble up the edges of the crater, with its crumbling clay and sand and chunks of brittle old asphalt, but without his leg working he is too heavy, too clumsy.\u201cNo,\u201d he whispers one more time, and lies there weeping as the battle rages out of sight, beyond his reach.[SPLEEN::UNIT] A toaster?! [EYE::LEFT] It was all I could think of! There wasn\u2019t a lot of time, you know. You try manufacturing realistic 3-D imagery on the fly. [CC] It doesn\u2019t matter. The image was successful. Comprehensive Lower Left Leg Replacement Unit, what\u2019s your status? [LEG::LEFT::COMPR-UNIT] I sustained only minor superficial damage in the fall, but have nevertheless activated my full protective lockdown routine. It seems a prudent precaution; do you not agree? [CC] I entirely support your operational decisions in this matter, Left Leg. I have alerted central command that we will require recovery once the battle has ended, but given that Joe is not in medical distress, we may be here for quite a while. As always, excellent teamwork, everyone.\u201cCC?\u201dJoe asks out loud, because who is he afraid might hear him? Dark has fallen, and he has heard nothing except night bugs for hours\u2014no shots or shells, no tanks or drones, not even the varied and horrific sounds of the slowly dying that marked the unsteady passing of afternoon. There is no longer anyone anywhere nearby to care about him one way or another.Yes, Joe? CC responds.\u201cHow much longer will we be here, do you think?\u201dI will query Cyber Command again, CC says. Then, some short time later, it continues. There were very heavy casualties on this push, and in the confusion we seem to have been moved to the Missing And Presumed Dead list. I have filed a corrective supplement, and as soon as it is processed we should receive an updated recovery estimate. It should not take long.\u201cOkay,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI just, you know. I don\u2019t want to die in a hole. It\u2019s not how I imagined going.\u201dI do not understand why you would wish to imagine dying at all, CC says.\u201cWhat do you know about living?\u201d he asks.I know you, CC says.Joe laughs. He can\u2019t see the stars above, and isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s because of light pollution, smoke, clouds, or that somehow they\u2019ve deserted him too. \u201cThat must suck for you. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and closes his eyes. \u201cCan you make me sleep until pickup is coming?\u201dYes, Joe, CC says, and does.A drone finally arrives and lifts him out of his pit as dawn is starting to rise. Other than the mall being slightly further reduced to rubble, the cars being slightly more burned and decrepit, the parking lot being slightly more pitted, and the new addition of blotches of red and brown, nothing seems to have changed at all.He is taken to medical, where after a lengthy wait diagnostics is able to easily unlock his leg. \u201cThe impact of the fall must have hit it just right to trigger the lockdown,\u201d the tech tells him. The tech shrugs. \u201cIt happens. You\u2019re fine now.\u201dSo Joe leaves, rather than argue about the definition of \u201cfine.\u201dNo one has orders for him, and no one seems to care that he\u2019s back. Lunch is just about to be served, so he goes to the mess instead of back to his bunk. After nearly a day in the pit, he wants to be around people, but there are only a few dozen soldiers there, and he is both grateful and despairing that he doesn\u2019t recognize any of them.One, however, recognizes him. A soldier with the name tag GONZALEZ sticks out his thick, muscled arm to stop him as he passes. \u201cBiscuit guy, right?\u201d the man says. He jabs his spoon toward his bowl. \u201cThis slop is the worst. No flavor at all, and the texture of fucking oatmeal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not oatmeal?\u201d Joe asks, because that\u2019s what it looks like.\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be fucking chili,\u201d the man says.Joe winces.\u201cI heard about your fixing the biscuits, like goddamned magic everyone said. So we\u2019d appreciate anything you can do with this,\u201d Gonzalez says, and the other soldiers at the table nod in agreement. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna ship us all out to join the Columbus offensive anytime now, and a man can\u2019t fight on this crap.\u201d\u201cWhat about Toledo? Did we take it?\u201d Joe asks.The soldier shakes his head. \u201cNo. Politicians don\u2019t like how the losses are looking to the public, so they\u2019re giving up on Toledo for now, just leaving enough men to hold the line where it is if they should push back. Calling it a \u2018strategic holding action,\u2019 of course. But the chili?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go talk to the kitchen,\u201d Joe says.When Joe walks into the kitchen Stotz leaps down off the prep table he was sitting on. \u201cHey!\u201d he says. \u201cYou made it! What happened to you out there?\u201d\u201cI dodged some sort of explosive device and got caught in a pit trap,\u201d Joe says, which sounds just as implausible coming out of his mouth as he\u2019d feared when he\u2019d thought up that answer in med.Stotz doesn\u2019t seem to notice, though, and slaps him hard on the back. \u201cSo good to see you. Now go stand guard at the door, because I figure I\u2019ve got less than fifteen minutes before everyone left on base mutinies over the shit food and comes in to kill me.\u201d\u201cThe chili,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI heard.\u201d\u201cNot my fault, man,\u201d Stotz says. \u201cAnd if you think the chili is bad, you should see the foamy shit coming out of the synthesizer ovens claiming to be corn bread. I didn\u2019t even send it out, that\u2019s how bad it was.\u201dJoe remembers the last time he was in here. \u201cI dunno,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to come in here and fuck with your shit, Stotz.\u201dStotz steps back and raises his arms as if to encompass the entire width of machinery around them, slowly chugging out foul smells into the air. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease, fuck with this shit.\u201dJoe cracks his knuckles. \u201cOkay then,\u201d he says. He steps up to the console by the machines making the corn bread, and CC gives him the new code without even him needing to ask. He scrolls through the current config, and shakes his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t even wanna know what they\u2019ve got in this, but yeah, if you\u2019d set this out you\u2019d have had a mob in here looking for you within thirty seconds. And then running for the latrines thirty seconds after that.\u201d\u201cCan you fix it?\u201d Stotz asks.\u201cI think I can,\u201d Joe says. He subtracts out the alum, vinegar, and tartar sauce, then ups the sugar and adds actual corn meal. He hits save, and the machines obligingly dump their load and start fresh. \u201cSix minutes,\u201d he says.Stotz lets out his breath. \u201cThanks, Joe,\u201d he says. \u201cI owe you. If I could get you assigned to me . . . \u201dI can submit that request for you, CC says inside his head. You have a sufficient number of combat deployments and injury incidents for a transfer to be seriously considered.Joe shrugs as casually as he is able. \u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI belong out there.\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Stotz says, but Joe chooses not to hear him. He goes to the first row of machines working on the chili, and although he\u2019s not any expert on how to make it right, he can certainly tell how to stop it being quite so blatantly wrong.When those machines turn over, already the kitchen smells vastly better. \u201cJoe\u2014\u201d Stotz starts to say, but Joe shakes his head and holds up both hands.\u201cIt\u2019s probably better if I don\u2019t come back here anymore,\u201d Joe says, and turns for the door.His cybernetic right ankle squeaks as he steps; it\u2019s never done that before, so he pauses, lifts his foot, and shakes it, then takes another step.It squeaks louder.Three steps later, his left leg begins to also squeak, both at ankle and knee, and as he\u2019s pushing out the door there is a chorus of squeals from his joints. \u201cCC?\u201d he subvocalizes.A fault in the nanolubricant distributors, CC tells him. I am attempting to isolate it now.Four steps into the dining hall and he stops, because now his new elbow and his right arm and his fingers are squeaking too, like he\u2019s suddenly rusted from the inside out.As he stands there, everyone turns to look at him, then as one they all stand up and rush toward him. In that instant he is terrified, convinced that his failures have reached a point where his fellow soldiers are turning on him, but the swell of people moves around and past him.He turns around after them to see why.Stotz has emerged from the kitchen behind him, pushing a cart laden with trays of cornbread and new pots of chili. \u201cBiscuit guy!\u201d someone yells, and he thinks it\u2019s Gonzalez, but there are so many voices all of a sudden it\u2019s hard to be sure.He turns away, and discovers his unit commander is standing in front of him, expression serious, unreadable. \u201cPrivate,\u201d his commander says. \u201cWe need to have a word.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d he blurts.The commander\u2019s gaze flickers to the frenzy of men around Stotz\u2019s cart, then back to Joe as if a brief glimmer of interest was found where none was expected. \u201cIt is about your mother,\u201d he says.Joe stares.\u201cWhen you were accidentally added to the Missing and Presumed Dead list, a condolence drone was automatically dispatched to your mother\u2019s place to inform her of your loss in battle and to return your personal belongings to her.\u201d\u201cI . . . \u201d he says, and isn\u2019t sure how he should feel, or respond. \u201cWas she okay?\u201dThe commander straightens up and squares his shoulders. He\u2019s the fifth unit commander Joe has had, and he\u2019s not even sure he remembers his name. Corporal Greene? Maybe. \u201cGrief affects people very differently, and reactions in the moment don\u2019t mean much,\u201d Greene says. \u201cI am sure, once informed of the mistake, your mother\u2014\u201d\u201cHow did she react?\u201d Joe interrupts. He pictures her collapsing on her doorstep, wailing. Or shouting at the officer that he is lying, that she can\u2019t have lost her only son, that she has so many regrets . . . He knows neither of those will be right, but he wants them, deserves those endings. \u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019d be better if\u2014\u201d\u201cPlease, sir,\u201d Joe interrupts again, knowing and not caring that he has done so. \u201cI need to know the truth, all of it, as it was.\u201dThe commander sighs. \u201cShe took the box from the drone, rummaged through it looking for any medals you\u2019d earned, then not finding any dumped it all on the sidewalk and went back inside.\u201d\u201cDid she say anything?\u201d Joe asks.\u201cShe said, \u2018of course not,\u2019\u201d the commander says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, soldier. As I said, grief\u2014\u201d\u201cThank you, commander,\u201d Joe says. He feels on the verge of paralysis, and needs to move, needs to do something. \u201cIs the transport ready for Columbus? I\u2019ll wait there.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t lift until midday tomorrow,\u201d Greene says. \u201cYou should return to your bunk, and\u2014\u201d\u201cYou just told me I have no belongings there anymore,\u201d Joe said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait on the transport.\u201d He knows it\u2019s insubordinate, but he can\u2019t stand there any longer and steps around Corporal Greene, toward the mess hall doors. His entire body squeaks and squeals, louder and louder with every movement small or large, but he doesn\u2019t care. This is his last chance.[SPLEEN::UNIT] Oh, seriously. Fuck this little penny ante shit. I\u2019ll do it myself.It is as if something small and sharp deep inside him has suddenly exploded, and his first thought is that it\u2019s a kidney, taking him out just like his father, but his kidneys are still his own.CC? he asks, as he stumbles and falls.Artificial Spleen Unit has self-destructed, CC says, and for all that he knows it\u2019s just a bunch of logic chips, it sounds almost as surprised and dismayed as he feels himself.Why? he asks.To save you, CC says. He is lying face down on the floor now, and there is a lot of noise around him, but he can\u2019t pay any attention to it through the pain until Stotz is there, rolling him over.\u201cJoe!\u201d Stotz yells, and shakes him. \u201cJoe! What happened?!\u201dThe unit commander has also leaned in. \u201cSoldier!\u201d he says, as if about to order him to be fine again. It feels like everyone else in the hall has crowded in around him, looking worried about him, as if that could ever be a thing.Joe fixes his eyes on the commander. \u201cDon\u2019t tell my mother I\u2019m alive,\u201d he says, and then laughs because maybe he isn\u2019t anyway, as the mess hall disappears into grayish fog around him.Stotz is the unhappiest happy man Joe decides he\u2019s ever met. Happy because now he\u2019s got a dedicated second person to run the mess, unhappy because instead of him being Joe\u2019s boss, it\u2019s the other way around. Not that Joe cares much about bossing.\u201cTotally unappreciated,\u201d Stotz says as he\u2019s wiping down the machines after another seemingly endless meal production. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the recipes they kept giving me were shit. The only difference between you and me is you hacked the access, and I don\u2019t think that alone should warrant a promotion.\u201d\u201cI could go work in the officer\u2019s kitchen,\u201d Joe says, scraping out the Extraneous Material Outlet Collection bin.\u201cWhat, and leave me alone here again? Hell no,\u201d Stotz says. He laughs. \u201cBesides, every time you try to leave, your joints squeak. Now that\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cYeah, so funny,\u201d Joe says, and frowns. The material in the bin is nasty, but much less so than when he first got back here, after his last stay in med. \u201cYou got a wire brush?\u201dStotz is about to throw him one when the kitchen door pops open and some random soldier sticks his head in. Another unit arrived two nights ago, will be gone by tomorrow, in an endless but steadily diminishing parade. \u201cHey!\u201d the soldier yells. \u201cWhich one of you two is Biscuit Guy?\u201dJoe and Stotz point at each other.\u201cFucking love you two,\u201d he says. \u201cBest dinner ever. You\u2019re fucking heroes out here. Wish us luck, okay?\u201d\u201cBest of luck and keep your head down,\u201d Stotz says.\u201cWatch out for toasters,\u201d Joe adds, and the man looks puzzled but not unhappy with that. He gives them a thumbs-up and disappears back out into the hall.It all still seems pointless. Toledo is still a disaster, Columbus is becoming one, and if you asked each one of the soldiers going out the door what they were fighting for, he\u2019s not sure most of them could answer, but Joe knows for certain that some battlefields are easier to walk off of than others.Stotz tosses him the brush, then holds up a datachip, the latest incoming program set from central dining services. \u201cWanna see how bad they screwed up Mac & Cheese?\u201d he asks.[CC] Welcome online, Autonomous Spleen Replacement Unit Model 448-G9.

In the socially unbalanced, pioneer cities of the Equatorial Ring, little scavengers tangled with the recycling machinery. They needed premium, Earth-atmosphere-and-pressure nursing or the flesh would not regenerate\u2014which they didn\u2019t get. The gouges and dents would be permanent: skinned over, like the scars on her forearms. Visible through thin clothing, like the depressions in her thighs. But this wasn\u2019t Mars, and she wasn\u2019t human, she was a Ki. He guessed, uneasily, at a more horrifying childhood poverty.\nShe seemed very young for her post: hardly more than a girl. She could almost have been a human girl with gene-mods. Could have chosen to adopt that fine pelt of silky bronze, glimmering against the bare skin of her palms, her throat and face. Chosen those eyes, like drops of black dew; the hint of a mischievous animal muzzle. Her name was Ki-anna, she represented the KiAn authorities. Her partner, a Shet called Roaaat Bhvaaan, his heavy uniform making no concession to the warmth of the space-habitat, was from Interplanetary Affairs, and represented Speranza. The Shet looked far more alien: a head like a gray boulder, naked wrinkled hide hooding his eyes.\nPatrice didn\u2019t expect them to be on his side, this odd couple, polite and sympathetic as they seemed. He must be careful, he must remember that his mind and body were reeling from the Buonarotti Transit\u2014two instantaneous interstellar transits in two days, the first in his life. He\u2019d never even seen a non-human sentient biped, in person, this time last week: and here he was in a stark police interview room with two of them.\n\u201cYou learned of your sister\u2019s death a Martian year ago?\u201d\n\u201cHer disappearance. Yes.\u201d\nKi-anna watched, Bhvaaan questioned: he wished it were the other way round. Patrice dreaded the Speranza mindset. Anyone who lives on a planet is a lesser form of life, of course we\u2019re going to ignore your appeals, but it\u2019s more fun to ignore them slowly, very, very slowly\u2014\n\u201cWe can agree she disappeared,\u201d muttered the Shet, what looked like mordant humor tugging the lipless trap of his mouth. \u201cYet, aah, you didn\u2019t voice your concerns at once?\u201d\n\u201cLione is, was, my twin. We were close, however far . . . When the notification of death came it was very brief, I didn\u2019t take it in. A few days later I collapsed at work, I had to take compassionate leave.\u201d\nAt first he\u2019d accepted the official story. She\u2019s dead, Lione is dead. She went into danger, it shouldn\u2019t have happened but it did, on a suffering war-torn planet unimaginably far away . . .\nThe Shet rolled his neckless head, possibly in sympathy.\n\u201cYou\u2019re, aah, a Social Knowledge Officer. Thap must be a demanding job. No blame if a loss to your family caused you to crash-out.\u201d\n\u201cI recovered. I examined the material that had arrived while I was ill: everything about my sister\u2019s last expedition, and the \u2018investigation.\u2019 I knew there was something wrong. I couldn\u2019t achieve anything at a distance. I had to get to Speranza, I had to get myself here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cQuite right, child. Can\u2019t do anything at long distance, aah.\u201d\n\u201cI had to apply for financial support, the system is slow. The Buonarotti Transit network isn\u2019t for people like me\u2014\u201d He wished he\u2019d bitten that back. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s for officials, diplomats, not civilian planet-dwellers.\u201d\n\u201cUnless they\u2019re idle super-rich,\u201d rumbled the Shet. \u201cOr refugees getting shipped out of a hellhole, maybe. Well, you persisted. Your sister was Martian too. What was she doing here?\u201d\nPatrice looked at the very slim file on the table. No way of telling if that tablet held a ton of documents or a single page.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d\n\u201cExplain it to us,\u201d said Ki-anna. Her voice was sibilant, a hint of a lisp.\n\u201cLione was a troposphere engineer. She was working on the KiAn Atmosphere Recovery Project. But you must know . . . \u201d They waited, silently. \u201cAll right. The KiAn war practically flayed this planet. The atmosphere\u2019s being repaired, it\u2019s a major Speranza project. Out here it\u2019s macro-engineering. They\u2019ve created a\u2014a membrane, like a casting mould, of magnetically charged particles. They\u2019re shepherding small water ice asteroids, other debris with useful constituents, through it. Controlled annihilation releases the gases, bonding and venting propagates the right mix. We pioneered the technique. We\u2019ve enriched the Martian atmosphere the same way . . . nothing like the scale of this. The job also has to be done from the bottom up. The troposphere, the lowest level of the inner atmosphere, is alive. It\u2019s a saturated fluid full of viruses, fragments of DNA and RNA, amino acids, metabolizing mineral traces, pre-biotic chemistry. The configuration is unique to a living planet, and it\u2019s like the mycorrhizal systems in the soil, back on Earth. If it isn\u2019t there, or it\u2019s not right, nothing will thrive.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t tell if they knew it all, or didn\u2019t understand a word.\n\u201cLione knew the tropo reconstruction wasn\u2019t going well. She found out there was an area of the surface, under the An-lalhar Lakes, where the living layer might be undamaged. This\u2014where we are now\u2014is the Orbital Refuge Habitat for that region. She came here, determined to get permission from the Ruling An to collect samples\u2014\u201d\nKi-anna interrupted softly. \u201cIsn\u2019t the surviving troposphere remotely sampled by the Project automats, all over the planet?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that obviously wasn\u2019t good enough. That was Lione. If it was her responsibility, she had to do everything in her power to get the job done.\u201d\n\u201cAah. Raarpht . . . Your sister befriended the Ruling An, she gained permission, she went down, and she stepped on a landmine. You understand that there was no body to be recovered? That she was vaporized?\u201d\n\u201cSo I was told.\u201d\nKi-anna rubbed her scarred forearms, the Shet studied Patrice. The interview room was haunted by meaning, shadowy with intent\u2014\n\u201cAap. You need to make a \u2018pilgrimage.\u2019 A memorial journey?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. There\u2019s something wrong.\u201d\nThe shadows tightened, but were they for him or against him?\n\u201cLione disappeared. I don\u2019t speak any KiAn language, I didn\u2019t have to, the reports were in English: when I hunted for more detail there are translator bots. I haven\u2019t missed anything. A vaporized body doesn\u2019t vanish. All that tissue, blood, and bone leaves forensic traces. None. No samples recovered. She was there to collect samples, don\u2019t tell me it was forbidden . . . She didn\u2019t come back, that\u2019s all. Something happened to her, something other than a warzone accident\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying your sister was murdered, Patrice?\u201d\n\u201cI need to go down there.\u201d\n\u201cI can see you\u2019d feel thap way. You realize KiAn is uninhabitable?\u201d\n\u201cA lot of places on Mars are called \u2018uninhabitable.\u2019 My work takes me to the worst-off regions. I can handle myself.\u201d\n\u201cAap. How do you feel about the KiAn issue, Messer Ferringhi?\u201d\nPatrice opened his mouth, and shut it. He didn\u2019t have a prepared answer for that one. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough.\u201d\nThe Shet and the Ki looked at each other, for the first time. He felt they\u2019d been through the motions, and they were agreeing to quit.\n\u201cAs you know,\u201d rumbled Bhvaaan, \u201cThe Ruling An must give permission. The An-he will see you?\u201d\n\u201cI have an appointment.\u201d\n\u201cThen thap\u2019s all for now. Enjoy your transit hangover in peace.\u201d\nPatrice Ferringhi took a moment, looking puzzled, before he realized he could go. He stood, hesitated, gave an odd little bow and left the room.\nThe Shet and the Ki relaxed somewhat.\n\u201cCollapsed at work,\u201d said Roaaat Bhvaaan. \u201cThap\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all be made of stone, Shet.\u201d\n\u201cAaah well. Cross fingers, Chief.\u201d\nThey were resigned to strange English figures of speech. The language of Speranza, of diplomacy, was also the language of interplanetary policing. You became fluent, or you relied on unreliable transaid: and you screwed up.\n\u201cAnd all my toes,\u201d said the Ki.\nOn his way to his cabin, Patrice found an ob-bay. He stared into a hollow sphere, permeated by the star-pricked darkness of KiAn system space: the limb of the planet obscured, the mainstar and the blue \u201cdaystar\u201d out of sight. Knurled objects flew around, suddenly making endless field-beams visible. One lump rushed straight at him, growing huge: seemed to miss the ob-bay by centimeters, with a roar like monstrous thunder. The big impacts could be close enough to make this Refuge shake. He\u2019d felt that, already. Like the Gods throwing giant furniture about\u2014\nHe could not get over the fact that nothing was real. Everything had been translated here by the Buonarotti Torus, as pure data. This habitat, this shipboard jumper he wore, this body. All made over again, out of local elements, as if in a 3D scanner . . . The scarred Ki woman fascinated him, he hardly knew why. The portent he felt in their meeting (had he really met her?) was what they call a \u201ctransit hangover.\u201d He must sleep it off.\nThe Ki-anna was rated Chief of Police, but she walked the beat most days. All her officers above nightstick grade were seconded from the Ruling An\u2019s Household Guard: she didn\u2019t like to impose on them. The Ki\u2014natural street-dwellers, if ever life was natural again\u2014melted indoors as she approached. Her uniform, backed by Speranza, should have made the refugees feel safe: but none of them trusted her. The only people she could talk to were the habitual criminals. They appreciated the Ruling An\u2019s strange appointment.\nShe made her rounds, visiting the nests where law-abiding people better stay away. The gangsters knew a human had \u201cjoined the station.\u201d\nThey were very curious. She sniffed the wind and lounged with the idlers, giving up Patrice Ferringhi in scraps, a resource to be conserved. The pressure of the human\u2019s strange eyes was still with her\u2014\nNo one ought to look at her scars like that, it was indecent.\nBut he was an alien, he didn\u2019t know how to behave.\nShe didn\u2019t remember being chosen for the treatment that would render her flesh delectable, while ensuring that what happened wouldn\u2019t kill her. She only knew she\u2019d been sold (tradition called it an honor) so that her littermates could live. She would always wonder, why me? What was wrong with me? We were very poor, I understand that, but why me? It had all been for nothing, anyway. Her parents and her littermates were dead, along with everyone else. So few survivors! A handful of die-hards on the surface. A token number of Ki taken away to Speranza, in the staggeringly distant Blue System. Would they ever return? The Ki-anna thought not . . . Six Refuge Habitats in orbit. And of course some of the Heaven-born, who\u2019d seen what was coming before the war, and escaped to Balas or to Shet.\nAt curfew she filed a routine report, and retired to her quarters in the Curtain Wall. Roaaat, who was sharing her living space, was already at home. It was fortunate that Shet didn\u2019t normally like to sit in Speranza-style \u201cchairs\u201d: he\u2019d have broken a hole in her ceiling. His bulk, as he lay at ease, dwarfed her largest room. They compared notes.\n\u201cAll the Refuges have problems,\u201d said the Ki-anna. \u201cBut I get the feeling I have more than my share. Extortion, intimidation, theft and violence\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can grease the wheels,\u201d said Roaaat. \u201cStrictly off the record, we can pay your villains off. It\u2019s distasteful, not the way to do police work.\u201d\n\u201cBut expedient.\u201d\n\u201cAap . . . He seemed very taken with you,\u201d said Roaaat.\n\u201cThe human? I don\u2019t know how you make that out.\u201d\n\u201cThap handsome Blue, yaas. I could smell pheromones.\u201d\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t a \u2018Blue\u2019 \u201d said the Ki-anna. \u201cThe almighty Blues rule Speranza. The humans left behind on Earth, or \u2018Mars\u2019\u2014What is \u2018Mars\u2019? Is it a moon?\u201d\n\u201cNoope. A smaller planet in the Blue system.\u201d\n\u201cWell, they aren\u2019t Blues, they\u2019re just ordinary aliens.\u201d\n\u201cI shall give up matchmaking. You don\u2019t appreciate my help . . . Let\u2019s hope the An-he finds your ordinary alien more attractive.\u201d\nThe Ki-anna shivered. \u201cI think he will. He\u2019s a simple soul.\u201d\nRoaaat was an undemanding guest, despite his size. They shared a meal, based on \u201cculturally neutral\u201d Speranza Food Aid. The Shet spread his bedding. The Ki-anna groomed herself, crouched by a screen that showed views of the Warrens. Nothing untoward stirred, in the simulated night. She pressed knuckle-fur to her mouth. Sometimes the pain of living, haunted by the uncounted dead, became very hard to bear. Waking from every sleep to remember afresh that there was nothing left.\n\u201cI might yet back out, Officer Bhvaaan. What if we only succeed in feeding the monsters, and make bad worse?\u201d\nShe unfolded her nest, and settled behind him.\nHe patted her side with his clubbed fist\u2014it felt like being clobbered by a kindly rock. \u201cSee how it goes. You can back out later.\u201d\nThe Ki-anna lay sleepless, wondering about Patrice Ferringhi; the bulk of her unacknowledged bodyguard between her and the teeth of the An\nWhen his appointment with alien royalty came around, Patrice was glad he\u2019d had a breathing space. The world was solid again, he felt in control of himself. He donned his new transaid, settling the pickup against his skull, and set out for the high-security bulkhead gate that led to the Refuge Habitat itself.\nArmored guards, intimidatingly tall, were waiting on the other side. They bent their heads, exhaled breath loudly\u2014and indicated that he was to get into a kind of floating palanquin. Probably they knew no English.\nThe guards jogged around him in a hollow square: between their bodies he glimpsed the approach to an actual castle, like something in a fantasy game. Like a recreation of Mediaeval Europe or Japan, rising from a mass of basic living modules. It was amazing. He\u2019d never been inside a big space-station before, not counting a few hours in Speranza Transit Port. The false horizon, the lilac sky, arcing far above the castle\u2019s bannered towers, would have fooled him completely, if he hadn\u2019t known.\nHe met the An-he in a windowless, antique chamber hung with tapestries (at least, tapestries seemed like the right word). Sleekly upholstered couches were scattered over the floor. The guard who\u2019d escorted him backed out, snorting. Patrice looked around, vaguely bothered by an overly-warm indoor breeze. He saw someone almost human, loose-limbed and handsome in Speranza tailoring, reclining on a couch\u2014large, wide-spaced eyes alight with curiosity\u2014and realized he was alone with the king.\n\u201cExcuse my steward,\u201d said the An. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak English well, and doesn\u2019t like to embarrass himself by trying. Please, be at home.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for seeing me,\u201d said Patrice. \u201cYour, er, Majesty\u2014?\u201d\nThe An-he grinned. \u201cYou are Patrice. I am the An, let\u2019s just talk.\u201d\nThe young co-ruler was charming and direct. He asked about the police: Patrice noted, disappointed, that Ki-anna was a title, the Ki-she, or something. He wondered what you had to do to learn their personal names.\n\u201cIt was a brief interview,\u201d he admitted, ruefully. \u201cI got the impression they weren\u2019t very interested.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I am interested. Lione was a great friend to my people. To both my peoples. I\u2019m not sure I understand, were you partners, or litter-mates?\u201d\n\u201cWe were twins, that means litter-mates, but \u2018partners\u2019 too, though our careers took different directions.\u201d\nHe needed to get partner into the conversation. The An partnership wasn\u2019t sexual, but it was lifelong, and the closest social and emotional bond they knew. A lost partner justified his appeal.\nThe An-he touched the clip on the side of his head (he was using a transaid, too), reflexively. \u201cA double loss, poor Patrice. Please do confide in me, it will help enormously if you are completely frank\u2014\u201d\nIn this pairing, the An-she was the senior. She made the decisions, but Patrice couldn\u2019t meet her, she was too important. He could only work on the An-he, who would (hopefully) promote his cause . . . He had the eerie thought that he was doing exactly what Lione had done\u2014trying to make a good impression on this alien aristocrat, maybe in this very room. The tapestries (if that was the word) swam and rippled in the moving air, drawing his attention to scenes he really didn\u2019t want to examine. Brightly dressed lords and ladies gathered for the hunt. The game was driven onto the guns. The butchery, the bustling kitchen scenes, the banquet\u2014\nHe realized, horrified, that his host had asked him something about his work on Mars, and he hadn\u2019t heard the question.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said the An-he, easily. \u201cI see what you\u2019re looking at. Don\u2019t be offended, it\u2019s all in the past, and priceless, marvelous art. Recreated, sadly. The originals were destroyed, along with the original of this castle. But still, our heritage! Don\u2019t you Blues love ancient battle scenes, heaps of painted slaughter? And by the way, aren\u2019t you closely related, limb for limb and bone for bone, to the beings that you traditionally kill and eat?\u201d\n\u201cNot on Mars.\u201d\n\u201cThere, you are sundered from your web of life. At home on Earth, the natural humans do it all the time, I assure you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\nNotoriously, the Ki and the An had both been affronted when they were identified, by other sentient bipeds, as a single species. Of course they knew, but an indecent topic! In ways, the most disturbing aspect of \u201cthe KiAn issue\u201d was not the genocidal war, in which the oppressed had risen up, savagely, against the oppressors. It was the fact that some highly respected Ki leaders actually defended \u201cthe traditional diet of the An.\u201d\nThe An-he showed his bright white teeth. \u201cThen you have an open mind, my dear Patrice! It gives me hope that you\u2019ll come to understand us.\u201d He stretched, and exhaled noisily. \u201cEnough. All I can tell you today is that your request is under consideration. You\u2019re a valuable person, and it\u2019s dangerous down there! We don\u2019t want to lose you. Now, I suppose you\u2019d like to see your sister\u2019s rooms? She stayed with us, you know: here in the castle.\u201d\n\u201cWould that be possible?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly! I\u2019ll get some people to take you.\u201d\nMore guards\u2014or servants in military-looking uniform\u2014led him along winding, irregular corridors, all plagued by that insistent breeze, and opened a round plug of a doorway. The An-he\u2019s face appeared, on a display screen emblazoned on a guard\u2019s tunic.\n\u201cTake as long as you like, dear Patrice. Don\u2019t be afraid of disturbing the evidence! The police took anything they thought was useful, ages ago.\u201d\nThe guards gave him privacy, which he had not expected: they shut the door and stayed outside. He was alone, in his sister\u2019s space. The eons he\u2019d crossed, the unthinkable interstellar distance, vanished. Lione was here. He could feel her, all around him. The warm air, suddenly still, seemed full of images: glimpses of his sister, rushing into his mind\u2014\n\u201cRecreation\u201d was skin-deep here. Essentially the room was identical to his cabin. A bed-shelf with a puffy mattress; storage space beneath. A desk, a closet bathroom, stripped of fittings. Her effects had been returned to Mars, couriered as data. The police had been and gone \u201cages ago.\u201d What could this empty box tell him? Nothing, but he had to try.\nWas he under surveillance? He decided he didn\u2019t care.\nHe searched swiftly, efficiently, studying the floor, running his hands over the walls and closet space, checking the seals on the mattress. The screen above the desk was set in an ornate decorative frame. He probed around it, and his fingertips brushed something that had slipped behind. Carefully, patiently, he teased out a corner of the object, and drew it from hiding.\nLione, he whispered.\nHe tucked his prize inside the breast of his shipboard jumper, and went to knock on the round door. It opened, and the guards were there.\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to leave now.\u201d\nThe An-he looked out of the tunic display again. \u201cBy all means! But don\u2019t be a stranger. Come and see me again, come often!\u201d\nThat evening he searched the little tablet\u2019s drive for his own name, for a message. He tried every password of theirs he could remember: found nothing, and was heartbroken. He barely noted the contents, except that it wasn\u2019t about her work. Next day, to his great surprise, he was recalled to the castle. He met the An-he as before, and learned that the Ruling An would like to approve his mission, but the police were making difficulties.\n\u201cSperanza doesn\u2019t mind having a tragedy associated with their showcase Project,\u201d said the young king. \u201cA scandal would be much worse, so they want to bury this. My partner and I feel you have a right to investigate, but we have met with resistance.\u201d\nThere was nothing Patrice could do . . . and it wasn\u2019t a refusal. If the alien royals were on his side, the police would probably be helpless in the end. Back in his cabin he examined the tablet again and realized that Lione had been keeping a private record of her encounter with \u201cthe KiAn issue.\u201d\nKiAn isn\u2019t like other worlds of the Diaspora; they didn\u2019t have a Conventional Space Age before First Contact. But they weren\u2019t primitives when \u201cwe\u201d found them, nor even Mediaeval. The An of today are the remnant of a planetary superpower. They were always the Great Nation, and the many nations of the Ki were treated as inferior, through millennia of civilization. But it was no more than fifteen hundred standard years ago, when, in a time of famine, the An or \u201cHeaven Born\u201d first began to hunt and eat the \u201cEarth Born\u201d Ki. They don\u2019t do that anymore. They have painless processing plants (or did). They have retail packaging\u2014\nCannibalism happens. It\u2019s known in every sentient and pre-sentient biped species. What developed on KiAn is different, and the so-called \u201catavists\u201d are not really atavist. This isn\u2019t the survival, as some on Speranza would like to believe, of an ancient prehistoric symbiosis. The An weren\u2019t animals, when this \u201cstable genocide\u201d began. They were people, who could think and feel. People, like us.\nThe entry was text-only, but he heard his sister\u2019s voice: forthright, uncompromising. She must have forced herself to be more tactful with the An-he! The next was video. Lione, talking to him. Living and breathing.\nInside the slim case, when he opened it, he\u2019d found pressed fragments of a moss, or lichen. Shards of it clung to his fingers; it smelled odd, but not unpleasant. He sniffed his fingertips and turned pages, painfully happy.\nDays passed, in a rhythm of light and darkness that belonged to the planet \u201cbelow.\u201d Patrice shuttled between the \u201cstation visitors quarters,\u201d where he was the only guest, and the An castle. He didn\u2019t dare refuse a summons, although he politely declined all dinner invitations, which made the An laugh.\nThe odd couple showed no interest in Patrice at all, and did not return his calls. He might have tried harder to get their attention, but there was Lione\u2019s journal. He didn\u2019t want to hand it over; or to lie about it either.\nOnce, as they walked in the castle\u2019s galleries, the insistent breeze nagging at him as usual, Patrice felt he was being watched. He looked up. From a high, curtained balcony a wide-eyed, narrow face was looking down intently. \u201cThat was the An-she,\u201d murmured his companion, stooping to exhale the words in Patrice\u2019s ear. \u201cShe likes you, or she wouldn\u2019t have let you glimpse her . . . I tell her all about you.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really see anything,\u201d said Patrice, wary of causing offence. \u201cThe breeze is so strong, tossing the curtains about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we\u2019re obsessed with air circulation, due to the crowded accommodation. There are aliens about, who don\u2019t always smell very nice.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry! I had no idea!\u201d\n\u201cOh no, Patrice, not you. You smell fresh and sweet.\u201d\nThe entries in Lione\u2019s journal weren\u2019t dated, but they charted a progress. At first he was afraid he\u2019d find Lione actually defending industrial cannibalism. That never happened. But as he immersed himself, reviewing every entry over and over, he knew Lione was asking him to understand. Not to accept, but to understand the unthinkable\u2014\nCompare chattel slavery. We look on the buying and selling of sentient bipeds, as if they were livestock, with revulsion. Who could question that? Then think of the intense bond between a beloved master, or mistress, and a beloved servant. A revered commanding officer and devoted troops. Must this go too? The An and the Ki accept that their way of life must change. But there is a deep equality in that exchange of being, which we \u201cdemocratic individualists\u201d can\u2019t recognize\u2014\nPatrice thought of the Ki-Anna\u2019s scars.\nThe \u201cdeep equality\u201d entry was almost the last.\nThe journal ended abruptly, with no sense of closure.\nLione\u2019s incense\u2014he\u2019d decided the \u201clichen\u201d was a kind of KiAn incense, perhaps a present from the An-he\u2014filled his cabin with a subtle perfume. He closed the tablet, murmuring the words he knew by heart, a deep equality in that exchange of being, and decided to turn in. In his tiny bathroom, for a piercing moment it was Lione he saw in the mirror. A dark-skinned, light-eyed, serious young woman, with the aquiline bones of their North African ancestry. His other self, who had left him so far behind\u2014\nThe whole journal was a message. It called him to follow her, and he didn\u2019t yet know where his passionate journey would end.\nWhen he learned that permission to visit the surface was granted, but the Ki-anna and the Interplanetary Affairs officer were coming too, he knew that the Ruling An had been forced to make this concession\u2014and the bargaining was over. He just wished he knew why the police had insisted on escorting him. To help Patrice discover the truth? Or to prevent him?\nHe didn\u2019t meet the odd couple until they embarked together. They were all in full protective gear: skin sealed with quarantine film, under soft-shell life-support suits. The noisy shuttle bay put a damper on conversation, and the flight was no more sociable. Patrice spent it encased in an escape capsule and breathing tanked air: the police insisted on this. He saw nothing of KiAn until he was crunching across the seared rubble of their landing field.\nThe landscape was dry tundra, like Martian desert color-shifted into shades of gray and green. Armed Green Belts were waiting, with a landship and all-terrain hardsuits for the visitors.\n\u201cThe An-he offered me a military escort,\u201d said Patrice, freedom of speech restored by helmet radio. \u201cWhat was wrong with that?\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d grunted Bhvaaan. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d\nThe Ki-anna said nothing. He remembered, vividly, the way he\u2019d felt at their meeting. There had been a connection, on her side too: he knew it. Now she was just another bulky Speranza doll, on a smaller scale than her partner. As if she\u2019d read his thoughts, she cleared her faceplate and looked out at him, curiously. He wanted to tell her that he understood KiAn, better than she could imagine . . . but not with Bhvaaan around.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping yourself to yourself, Messer Ferringhi.\u201d\n\u201cI could say the same of you two, Officer Bhvaaan.\u201d\n\u201cAap. But you made friends with the An-he.\u201d\n\u201cThe Ruling An were very willing to help me.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working in your interest too,\u201d said the Ki-anna. She pivoted her suit to look through the windowband in the landship\u2019s flank. \u201cFar below this plateau, back that way, was the regional capital. Were fertile plains, rich forests, towns and fields and parklands. The \u2018roof of Heaven\u2019 was never beautiful. It\u2019s strange, this part hardly seems much changed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cExcept that one dare not breathe,\u201d she added, sadly.\nOn the shore of the largest ice sheet, the Lake of Heaven, the odd couple and Patrice disembarked. The Ki-anna led the way to a great low arch of rock-embedded ice. The Green Belts had stayed in the ship.\nEverything was livid mist.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going under An-lalhar Lake alone?\u201d\n\u201cThe Green Belts\u2019ll be on call. It\u2019s not their jurisdiction down there. It\u2019s a precious enclave where the Ki and the An are stubbornly dying together.\u201d Bhvaaan peered at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not our jurisdiction either, Messer Ferringhi. If we meet with violence we can protect you, but that\u2019s after the event and it might not save your life. The people under the Lake don\u2019t have a lot to lose and their mood is volatile. Bear that in mind.\u201d\n\u201cI could have had an escort they\u2019d respect.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re better off with us.\u201d\nThey descended the tunnel. The light never grew less; on the contrary, it grew brighter. When they emerged, the Heaven Lake was above them: a mass of blue-white radiance, indigo shadowed, shot through with rainbow refractions. It was extraordinarily beautiful. It seemed impossible that the ice had captured so much light from the poisoned smog. Far off, in the center of the glacial depression, geothermal vents made a glowing, spiderweb pattern of fire and snowy steam. Patrice checked his telltales, and eagerly began to release his helmet. The Shet dropped a gauntleted fist on his arm.\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it, child. Look at your rads.\u201d\n\u201cA moment won\u2019t kill me. I want to feel KiAn\u2014\u201d\nThe odd couple, hidden in their gear, seemed to look at him strangely.\n\u201cMaybe later,\u201d said the Ki-anna, soothingly. \u201cIt\u2019s safer in the Grottos, where your sister was headed.\u201d\n\u201cHow do we get there?\u201d\n\u201cWe walk,\u201d rumbled Bhvaaan. \u201cNo vehicles. There\u2019s not much growing but it\u2019s still a sacred park. Let your suit do the work; keep up your fluids.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, I know how to handle a hard shell.\u201d\nThey walked in file. The desolation, the ruined beauty that had been revered by both \u201craces,\u201d caught at Patrice\u2019s heart. His helmet display counted rads, paces, heart rate: counted down the meters. Thirty kilometers to the place where Lione had last been seen alive.\n\u201cWhich faction mined the Lake of Heaven parkland?\u201d\n\u201cTo our knowledge? Nobody did, child.\u201d\nIt was a question he\u2019d asked over and over, long ago when he thought he could get answers. Now he asked and didn\u2019t care. He followed the Shet, the Ki-anna behind him. His pace was steady, yet the display said his body was pumping adrenalin; not from fear, he knew, but in the grip of intense excitement. He sucked on glucose and tried to calm himself.\nAs the radiance above them dimmed, they reached the Grotto domain. Rugged rocky pillars seemed to hold up the roof of ice, widely spaced at first, clustering towards a center that could not be seen. There was a Ki community, surviving in rad-proofed modules. The Ki-anna went inside. Patrice and the Shet waited, in the darkening blighted landscape. She emerged after an hour or so.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go on without guides, and we can\u2019t have guides until tomorrow. At the earliest. They have to think it over.\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t expecting us?\u201d\n\u201cThey were. They know all about it, but they may have had fresh instructions. They\u2019re in full communication with the castle: there\u2019s some sophisticated kit in there. We\u2019ll just have to wait.\u201d\n\u201cDo they remember Lione?\u201d demanded Patrice. \u201cI have transaid, I want to talk to someone.\u201d\n\u201cNot now. I\u2019ll ask tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cCan we sleep indoors?\u201d asked the Shet.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe Shet and the Ki-anna made camp in the ruins of the former village, using their suits to clear ground and construct a shelter. Patrice moved over to a heap of boulders where he\u2019d noticed patches of lichen. He had fragments of Lione\u2019s incense in the sleeve pocket of his inner, in a First Aid pouch. The police were fully occupied: furtively he opened the arm of his hardshell, and fished the pouch out. He was right, it was the same\u2014\nLione had stood here. The incense was not a gift, she had gathered it. She had been standing right here. His need was irresistible. He released his face-plate, stripped his gauntlets, rubbed away quarantine film.\nKiAn rushed in on him, cold and harsh in his throat, intoxicating\u2014\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\nThe Ki-anna was behind him. \u201cA lichen sample,\u201d said Patrice, caught out. \u201cOr that\u2019s what I\u2019d call it at home. It was in my sister\u2019s room, in the An Castle. Look, they\u2019re the same!\u201d\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d said the Ki-anna. \u201cYours is a cultivated variety.\u201d\nHe thought she\u2019d be angry, maybe accuse him of concealing evidence. To his astonishment she took his bared hand, and bowed over it until her cheek brushed the vulnerable inner skin of his wrist. Her touch was a huge shock, sweet and profoundly sexual. She made him dizzy.\nThis can\u2019t be happening, he thought. I\u2019m here for Lione\u2014\n\u201cI don\u2019t know your name.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do that,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cI felt, I can\u2019t describe it, the moment I met you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d better keep this. You must get your gloves and helmet back on.\u201d\n\u201cBut I want KiAn\u2014\u201d\nGently, she let go of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\nThe shelter was a snug fit. Sealed inside, they shared rations and drank fresh water they\u2019d brought from the Habitat. They would sleep in their suits, for warmth and security. Patrice lay down at once, to escape their questions and to be alone with his confusion. He was here for Lione, he was here to join Lione. How could he and the Ki-anna suddenly feel this way?\n\u201cWere you getting romantic, with Patrice, over by those rocks?\u201d asked Bhvaaan. \u201cSniffing his pheromones?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Ki-anna, grimly. \u201cSomething else.\u201d\nShe showed him the First Aid pouch and its contents.\n\u201cMighty Void!\u201d\n\u201cHe says it was in the room Lione used, in the castle.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so! We took that cabin apart.\u201d The Shet\u2019s delicates unfolded from his club of a fist. He turned the clear pouch around, probing her find with sensitive tentacles. \u201cSo that\u2019s how, so that\u2019s how\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how the cookie was crumbled,\u201d agreed the Ki-anna.\n\u201cWhat do we do, Chief? Abort this, and run away very quickly?\u201d\n\u201cNot without back-up. If we run, and they have heavy weaponry, we\u2019re at their mercy. I see what it looks like, but we should show no alarm.\u201d\n\u201cI have had thoughts about him,\u201d she murmured, looking at the dark outline of Patrice Ferringhi. \u201cDon\u2019t know why. It\u2019s something in his eyes.\u201d\n\u201cThaap\u2019s the way it starts,\u201d said the Shet. \u201cThoughts. Then wondering if anything can come of them. They say sentient bipeds are attracted to each other like . . . like brothers and sisters, long separated. Well, I\u2019ll talk to the Greenies. And you and I had better not sleep.\u201d\nThe suit was a house the shape of her body. She sat in it, wondering about sexual pleasure: pleasure with Patrice. What would it be like? She had only one strange comparison, but that didn\u2019t frighten her . . . What Roaaat Bhvaaan offered was far more disturbing.\nShe glimpsed the abyss, and fell into oblivion.\nPatrice dreamed he was in a strolling crowd, among bronze and purple trees, with branches that swayed in the breeze. He knew where he was, he was in the KiAn Orientation, a virtual reality. But there was something sinister going on, the crowd pressed too close, the beautiful trees hid what he ought to see. Then Lione came running up and bit him.\nHe yelled, and shook her off.\nShe came back and bit his thigh, but now he was in the dark, cold and sore. Lione was gone, he was being hunted by fierce hungry animals\u2014\nSuddenly he knew he was not asleep.\nHe was completely naked. Where was his suit? Where was he?\nHe had no idea. The air was freezing, the darkness almost complete. He stumbled towards a gleam ahead, and entered a rocky cave. There was ice underfoot, icy stalactites hanging down. A lamp burned incense-scented oil, set on the ground next to a heap of something\u2014\nThat\u2019s a body, he thought. He went over and knelt down. It was a human body, freeze-dried. She was curled on her side, turned away from him, but he knew he\u2019d found Lione. She was naked too.\nWhy was she naked?\nHe lifted the lamp and saw where flesh had been cut away, not by teeth, as in his dream, but by sharp knives. Lione had been butchered. He tried to turn her: the body moved all of a piece. Her face was recognizable, smooth and calm in death, the eyes sunken, the skin like cured leather. Was she smiling? Oh, Lione\u2014\nBut why am I naked? he thought. Who brought me here?\nThe Ki entered the cave, and surrounded Patrice and his sister. They had brought more lights. One of them was carrying, reverently, a flattened spherical object, dull gray, the size of Patrice\u2019s fist. It had a seam around the center, a beveled cap. That\u2019s a vapor mine, he thought, shaken by an explosion of understanding. Then the An came. The Ki made no attempt to interfere with the banquet. They were here to witness. Patrice screamed. He fought the knives with his bare hands, kicked out with his bare feet. The An, outraged, kept yelling at him in scraps of English to keep still, be easy Blue, you want this, what\u2019s wrong with you?\nThe Ki-anna and the Shet had ditched their hard shells, to search the narrow passages. They arrived armed but badly outnumbered, and they couldn\u2019t get near Patrice. \u201cI was the Earth In Heaven!\u201d shouted the Chief of Police. \u201cI say that flesh is not sacred, not yours to take. Let the stranger go!\u201d\nShe held the fanatics at bay, uncertain because of her former status, until the Green Belts joined the party. Luckily Bhvaaan had summoned them, before he and the Ki-anna followed Patrice into that drugged sleep.\nPatrice\u2019s injuries were not dangerous. As soon as he was allowed he signed himself out of medical care. He had to talk to the police again. He met the odd couple in the same bare interview room as before.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I need to withdraw my statement. I can\u2019t press charges.\u201d\nIf the next of kin didn\u2019t press charges, KiAn law made it difficult for Interplanetary Affairs to prosecute. He knew that, but he had no choice.\n\u201cI realize the tablet I found in Lione\u2019s room was planted on me. I know her words, if some of them were genuinely hers, had been rearranged to fool me into accepting atavism. It doesn\u2019t matter. My sister wanted to die that way. She gave herself, her body. It was a ritual sacrifice, for peace. She was my twin, I can\u2019t explain, I have to respect her wishes.\u201d\n\u201cA beautiful, consensual ritual,\u201d remarked the Shet. \u201cYaap. That\u2019s what the cannibal die-hards always say. But if you scratch any of these halfway \u2018respectable\u2019 atavists, such as our Ruling An here\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou find the meat-packing industry,\u201d said the Ki-anna.\nPatrice heard the blinkered, Speranza mindset.\n\u201cMy sister was willing.\u201d\n\u201cI believe she was.\u201d To his confusion, the Ki-anna reached out, took his injured hand and held his wrist, where the blood ran, to her face. The same sweet, intimate gesture as on KiAn. \u201cSo are you, a little. It\u2019ll wear off.\u201d\nShe drew back, and placed an evidence bag, containing his First Aid pouch and the scraps of lichen, on the table.\n\u201cIn English, the common name of this herb, or lichen, would be \u2018Willingness.\u2019 It grows naturally only under the Lake of Heaven. Long ago it was known as a powerful aphrodisiac: the labwork kind has another use. It\u2019s given to a child chosen to be the Ki-anna, which means sold to the An as living meat. It\u2019s a refined form of cannibalism, practiced in my region. A drugged child, a willing victim, with a strong resistance to infection and trauma, is eaten alive, by degrees. If one of these children survives to adulthood, they are free, the debt is paid.\nThe Ki-anna showed her teeth. \u201cI made it, as you see; but I haven\u2019t forgotten that scent. When I smelled your flesh, under the Lake, I knew you\u2019d been treated for butchery\u2014and I understood. They drugged Lione until she was delirious with joy to be eaten, and they sent her to the atavist fanatics under An-lalhar. Then they tried the same trick on you.\u201d\nBhvaaan tapped the casefile tablet with his delicates. \u201cYour sister died too quickly, that was the problem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t prove it, but we knew they\u2019d killed Lione, Messer Ferringhi. We could even show, thanks to the Chief here, who was pulling the strings, and how they got the prohibited ordnance into the Grottos. Your sister fell into a trap. She had to get under the Heaven Lake and that suited the atavists just fine. It would have been a powerful message. A Speranza scientist ritually eaten, then consumed by the very air of KiAn\u2014\u201d\n\u201cControlled annihilation,\u201d whispered Patrice. \u201cThat\u2019s what I saw, in the cave. Something they would understand\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThap was the idea. The atavists are planning to bring back the meat factories, once their planet has an atmosphere again. Your sister was going to help them: except something didn\u2019t work out. You were right about the tropo sampling: there\u2019s also stringent military activity monitoring. If a mine had gone off under the Lake, we\u2019d know. If a human-sized body had been atomized, there\u2019d have been a spike. So we knew the \u2018consummation\u2019 hadn\u2019t happened, and we couldn\u2019t figure it out. We think we know the answer now: she died too quickly. She had to be vaporized alive, a dead body can\u2019t be willing. But she wasn\u2019t a Ki, and they hit an artery or something.\u201d\nPatrice had gone gray in the face.\n\u201cYou going to crash out, child\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cNo, go on\u2014\u201d\nThe Shet rearranged his bulk on the inadequate office chair. \u201cThe autopsy\u2019ll tell us the details. Then you came along, Patrice. We saw a chance to get ourselves to the crime scene, and wasted Diaspora funds pushing on an open door. And you nearly died, because we drank the nice fresh water from this Habitat. Which happened to be doped\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe atavists thought the willingness they\u2019d cooked up for Lione would work on you,\u201d explained the Ki-anna. \u201cThey\u2019ve never heard of \u2018fraternal twins.\u2019 Ki litter-mates can be of any sex, but otherwise they are identical. You were begging to be lured to the Grottos, it was perfect, you would replace Dr Ferringhi. Luckily, you and your sister weren\u2019t clones. You were affected, but you weren\u2019t ready to be butchered. You fought for your life.\u201d\n\u201cYou see, Messer Ferringhi,\u201d said Bhvaaan, \u201cwhat really happened here is that a pair of murdering atavist bastards thought they\u2019d appoint themselves as Chief of Police a child who had been eaten. A girl like that, they thought, will never dare to do us any damage. Instead they found they had a tiger by the tail . . . \u201d He opened the casefile tablet, and pushed it over to Patrice. \u201cThey\u2019re glamorous, the Atavist An. But your sister would never have fallen for them in her right mind, from what I\u2019ve learned of her. Still want to withdraw this?\u201d\nPatrice was silent, eyes down. The Ki-anna saw him shedding the exaltation of the drug; quietly taking in everything he\u2019d been told. A new firmness in the lines of his face, a deep sadness as he said farewell to Lione. The human felt her eyes. He looked up and she saw another farewell, sad but final, to something that had barely begun\u2014\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I should go through it again. Can we do that now?\u201d\nThe Ki-anna returned to her quarters.\nRoaaat joined her in a while. She sat by her window on the streets, small chin on her silky paws, and didn\u2019t look round when he came in.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. What will you do? You\u2019ll have to leave, after this.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Leave or get killed, and I must not get killed.\u201d\n\u201cYou could go with Patrice, see what Mars is like.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The pheromones are no more, now that he knows what \u2018making love to the Ki-anna\u2019 is supposed to be like.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no idea what making love to you is supposed to be like. But you\u2019re a damned fine investigator. Why don\u2019t you come to Speranza?\u201d\nYes, she thought. I knew all along what you were offering.\nBanishment, not just from my own world, but from all the worlds. Never to be a planet-dweller any more. And again I want to ask, Why me? What did I do? But you believe it is an honor and I think you are sincere.\n\u201cMaybe I will.\u201d\nOriginally published in Engineering Infinity, edited by Jonathan Strahan.\nGwyneth Jones was born in Manchester, England and is the author of more than twenty novels for teenagers, mostly under the name Ann Halam, and several highly regarded SF novels for adults.

I was in, scrubbing blood from the walls with a palmful of sand.\nThat was the summer Enah came to our village. He\u2019d led a donkey, and the donkey pulled a cart with tools, a flowering lilac, and a barrel of fresh water. The barrel made Enah richer than the doctor, richer than the preacher. Richer than anyone but us, and he meant to change that.\nI heard footsteps crunching the cracked earth outside, but I assumed it was a pumpyard guard until Papa went silent and his dogs went barking mad and I looked to see why. There they were, in the dry riverbed: Papa and Fran\u00e7ois and the Rottweilers all glaring at Enah, who approached as though he feared nothing. He had skin as dark as Fran\u00e7ois; he walked barefoot, and smiled. People weren\u2019t in the habit of smiling at my father.\nEnah and Papa exchanged a few words, then turned and came into the house with the dogs keeping pace. \u201cMake us tea,\u201d Papa said, and I was banished to the kitchen. I boiled the water and measured the leaves, and brought out the teapot and the cups, several of them chipped. I poured for my father first, then Enah. Enah didn\u2019t say anything. Not even to acknowledge such luxury.\n\u201cIn the next months, I\u2019m going to sink my pumps another ten meters into the ground,\u201d Papa was saying. \u201cI can bring more water up and provide it even more cheaply to the people of this village.\u201d\n\u201cThe people of this village do not want to pay for something the world provides freely,\u201d Enah said. Papa snorted, boar-like.\n\u201cNot so freely. My grandfather would have called this a drought; I call it the state of things. It rains perhaps thirty days a year. Your program might work where you\u2019re from, but here, it\u2019s foolishness.\u201d\nEnah shrugged. \u201cThere was a river here once,\u201d he said, and sipped the steaming tea.\n\u201cThat mountain to the east was a volcano once,\u201d Papa said. \u201cThe world changes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we are often the ones who change it.\u201d Enah shrugged again. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve promised them, Mr. Wolfe: there was a river here once and there will be again.\u201d\nThey sat watching each other for a moment, these two men, Enah small and strange with laughter lines around his mouth and forehead, Papa solid and strong with anger carved into his brow.\n\u201cThere is a house here now,\u201d Papa said. \u201cA family. A dozen workers. Water pumps. You\u2019d have us all vanish?\u201d\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Enah said. \u201cI\u2019d have you go up the bank, join the rest of your town. It must be lonely down here.\u201d\nIt was lonely down there.\nEver since Mama died, Papa and I went around with a higher awareness of mortality. His mortality, mostly. Papa wasn\u2019t a young man, and death was something we expected with half a head. Death was like rain\u2014uncommon, but it would come.\nSo ever since Mama died, I had a bag packed, and I was ready to run away. I knew I couldn\u2019t survive on the riverbed without Papa, though I didn\u2019t know where I could go. Up to the village, if they\u2019d take me, but what would I do? Set bones, or forage in the brush, or whore myself?\nOr I could set off. See what lay beyond the horizon, and beyond the horizon beyond that. Water would be the problem\u2014so heavy, so necessary, and something that unlike the people of the village I had never learned to go without.\nThe riverbed had been parched for as long as I could remember, its dirt cracked and peeling like thick and brittle plates. You could throw them toward the bank, and watch them burst into plumes of dust. Our family drilled deep and sucked water from the earth, and it was enough to keep us wealthy, by our own, dusty standards of wealth.\nPapa sent Enah away. Then he went out to the pumpyard, and I ran out after our visitor. \u201cWait!\u201d\nEnah turned and looked at me. \u201cWe weren\u2019t introduced,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m Lena,\u201d I said. \u201cLena Wolfe. You say you can bring the river back?\u201d\nHe looked up and down the riverbed. The town was clustered on the bank, and my grandfather\u2019s home and his father\u2019s home connected the town and our farm like the dots of an ellipsis. My family had always followed the water.\n\u201cLet me ask you something,\u201d Enah said. \u201cWhy is it you think these people don\u2019t seek their fortunes elsewhere?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cThis is home,\u201d I said.\nHe nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s their home, and it\u2019s still possible to live here. If it is possible to live, many will stay where they\u2019ve buried their parents, and where they\u2019ve dug the wells with their hands, and laid the cobblestones. And besides, the sun is hot everywhere. Water is precious everywhere.\u201d He tapped the ground with one foot. \u201cWhat is the name of this river?\u201d\nThe name dried up when the water did. I think Papa knew it. I think it was written on the old maps, but we didn\u2019t use the old maps. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d\nEnah turned to look at me, and his eyes were as sharp as a carrion bird\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve brought waters to desert arroyos, Lena. I can make this river flow again. And when the waters flow again, your town will name it.\u201d\nHe reached out to touch my cheek, and I stepped back. Ordinarily, no one would touch me\u2014I\u2019d have a dog, like Papa\u2019s dogs, to dissuade anyone from coming too close. Not then, though. Papa had killed my dog that morning.\n\u201cThere will be enough water to grow hyacinths here,\u201d Enah said.\n\u201cWhat are hyacinths?\u201d I asked.\nI went to the pumpyard to draw water to pay the guards\u2019 salaries. I hated going to the pumps, but they were locked so the guards couldn\u2019t draw their own. The men who guarded them, with old automatics and new machetes, looked at me as though only my father kept them from leaping on me like wolves.\nOnly my father. So much in my life was because of my father, or only my father. Because of my father, I would never die of thirst. Only my father aimed to keep life and death in a birdcage on his accounting desk.\nWhen I\u2019d filled the jugs and dragged the heavy handcart back to Papa\u2019s office, I saw Papa yelling at Fran\u00e7ois. Almost-yelling. Papa only barely raised his voice, but it felt like a shot from a cannon.\n\u201cBy God, they won\u2019t have their way!\u201d Papa was saying.\nFran\u00e7ois, a braver man than most, said \u201cGod is not always merciful to our needs.\u201d\nI\u2019d never heard him speak back to Papa before.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about God\u2019s mercy,\u201d Papa said. \u201cWho has mercy? He doesn\u2019t. I don\u2019t. And you least of all.\u201d His voice became harder, like stone. \u201cGo find whoever brought this troublemaker to our village. Make sure they don\u2019t bring any more trouble our way.\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois stood with his jaw muscles bulging. He must have been biting down hard.\n\u201cWell?\u201d Papa said, and raised his hand as though to strike him. \u201cGo on! Go!\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois turned and walked outside.\nPapa turned to me, and I stared at him. Then he sighed, and clicked his fingers twice. One of the dogs perked his ears, ready for commands.\n\u201cYou should take Brutus,\u201d Papa said, though neither of his dogs will obey anyone but him. \u201cJaime\u2019s bitch is about to pup; we\u2019ll train up another dog for you soon.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have Mogul back,\u201d I said.\nPapa was not a man who showed sadness, but sometimes, I could catch a softness in his eyes. Only for me. \u201cThey never live once the bloody coughs start.\u201d\n\u201cYou never treat them,\u201d I said.\n\u201cWe are all dying, Lena,\u201d he said, and started out past me. \u201cIf I kill them a week before their time or five years before their time, what does it matter?\u201d He stopped at the doorway to touch my cheek. \u201cYou are the only one I will fight to keep alive.\u201d\nPapa would fight anything. Fighting was the only life he knew.\nWhen my mother came down with the cough, he fought the doctors. He fought the dust which rolled in through the windows. He even fought my mother\u2019s body. When she died, he seemed like a man who\u2019d lost a public match\u2014pride smarting, eyes burning, looking to prove himself back up.\nBy that summer, when the dogs were sick, he\u2019d take a machete and lop off their heads. Maybe he thought it was winning if he didn\u2019t watch them dwindle away.\nI went to fill the drip-irrigators. I passed the side path leading to the gate, where Fran\u00e7ois was sharpening his machete, his skin gleaming in the sunlight in contrast to my own. Fran\u00e7ois was as strong and dark as Mogul once was, and I was as tan and useless as the dirt on the riverbed.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your dog?\u201d he demanded.\n\u201cHe was sick,\u201d I said.\nFran\u00e7ois said, huh, and went back to sharpening.\n\u201cWhat did you mean,\u201d I asked him, \u201cthat God is not always merciful?\u201d\n\u201cYou know what I meant. The world doesn\u2019t work the way we\u2019d like it.\u201d\n\u201cBut why did you say it?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy God?\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois shrugged one corded shoulder. \u201cA saying came to mind. A story my parents told me.\u201d\nPapa never told me stories. Mama had, but Mama was gone. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said.\nFran\u00e7ois grimaced. I think he wanted to be rid of me. He didn\u2019t speak much, and especially not to me. Still, my father paid him, and paid him twice as much as anyone else on the water farm, so he indulged most things.\n\u201cThe Prophet Mohammed was told to prove the greatness of God,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois said. \u201cHe shook his fist at a mountain and said \u2019Come here, mountain, so I may pray on you!\u2019 The mountain didn\u2019t come. The Prophet turned to his people and said \u2019If that mountain had come, it would have crushed us. So you see, God is merciful. I\u2019ll go to the mountain and thank God for sparing his foolish children.\u2019\u201d\nI chewed on that. \u201cSo if the river comes, God won\u2019t stop the water from flooding our home?\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois shrugged.\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you Muslim?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou still remember those Islamic stories. Weren\u2019t your parents Muslims?\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois put the finishing edge on his machete and stood up. \u201cYou\u2019ll learn one day that you can\u2019t always do what your parents want you to,\u201d he said. He looked over at the edge of the river, up toward the village on the lip. \u201cMy parents would be disappointed in what I do. Besides.\u201d He rested his machete on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not right to profess what you don\u2019t believe.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t believe in a God, either. My father prayed, but never told me who he prayed to. Mama had been a Catholic from an old sect. I usually found Fran\u00e7ois the most sensible of all of them.\nI took two gallons of water, separated into quarts, up the bank to the market. The people there watched me, many of them angry, but not as hungry as the guards we kept sweating and rich on the farm. Papa said people resented the rich, and that it shouldn\u2019t bother me.\nFran\u00e7ois had followed me up and I wondered if my father had told him to be my dog until I had a new one, but then he went on his way and I put him out of my mind.\nThe noise of the market quieted as I passed by, and resumed again in pitched whispers, and the stares were more furtive. Because I didn\u2019t have my dog, or because of Enah?\nI found Jaime, who was at least kind to me, under a frayed sunshade, fixing small electronics. A rickety contraption of rods and wires with a metal dish in the middle was perched on the edge of his table, with a radio tied into it.\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked, and he flashed me a grin.\n\u201cListen to that,\u201d he said, and turned the radio on.\nThere weren\u2019t many stations nearby\u2014there was the Christ Channel, and the staticky weather for a city climates away. And then there was this, a violin, a channel I\u2019d never heard before.\nI strained forward into the music. \u201cIs it a new station?\u201d\n\u201cJust far away,\u201d Jaime said. \u201cBut with that antenna, I can focus in on it.\u201d He turned up the volume as high as it would go. I closed my eyes and breathed it in.\nThe song ended, and someone spoke in a foreign tongue. \u201cPapa says you have a dog ready to pup,\u201d I said.\nJaime nodded. \u201cAny day now. The best of my stock.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll want to buy a boy,\u201d I said. \u201cIf there\u2019s one you don\u2019t keep back for breeding, reserve it for us.\u201d\nHe looked at me quizzically. \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t have Mogul with you.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t ask, What happened? And so I didn\u2019t tell him, even as the words pressed on the back of my tongue. I didn\u2019t say how his entire body had shaken when he sneezed, how blood had sprayed out from his nostrils to paint the living room walls. \u201cHe was sick,\u201d I said. And they never live once the coughing starts.\nJaime understood. \u201cTell your Papa that these dogs are companions and workers, not pieces of equipment he can use up and replace.\u201d There was no heat to his tone. We were his best customers, and sometimes his only customers for months at a time.\nBeside him, the man on the radio stopped talking and a new song started up. \u201cJaime,\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make anything that beautiful?\u201d\nJaime shook his head. \u201cWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t you see the soapstone carvings Elise does? Hear Luc singing to his rabbits? See the mats Camille weaves out of the grasses? There are beautiful things all over the village.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d I answered, but my head was full of the violin, my mind\u2019s eye captured by the curves of its wood. I had only seen pictures in old books. \u201cBut why don\u2019t we make anything that beautiful?\u201d\nJaime sighed. \u201cBecause beautiful flowers don\u2019t grow on dry clay, girl,\u201d he said, and I felt myself drop in his estimation. \u201cWhen we\u2019re not too busy scraping by, we\u2019ll go to another city just to buy a violin. Or perhaps you should ask your father to buy one for you.\u201d\nThe words stung, so I turned to leave.\nI bought rabbit meat from Luc, and wild garlic and scrawny tubers from strange old Abed. Traded water for soap, for thread, for a tin of white paint to cover the blood I hadn\u2019t been able to scrub away. Then I started back down toward the water farm, but Enah caught my eye.\nHe was sitting on the edge of his cart, at the lip of the river bank, leaning down to draw pictures in the dirt with a stick. He was surrounded by villagers, and all of them watched him like a prophet. I drew nearer.\n\u201c. . . and when that is done,\u201d he was saying, \u201cthere will be water to last you between rains, and we can turn our attention to healing the river. We\u2019ll dig percolation trenches, to let water return to the aquifer.\u201d\nBy then people had noticed me, and they were muttering. I\u2019d decided it was time to go when Enah looked up and motioned me forward.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he said. \u201cCome up and see.\u201d He looked to the villagers, and before they could say anything he said, \u201cThe water we\u2019ll bring is for everyone; go ahead and let her in.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll just tell her father,\u201d one of them said. I didn\u2019t look to see who.\n\u201cI\u2019d tell him myself if he asked me,\u201d Enah said. \u201cCome up, Miss Wolfe.\u201d\nI looked around at the faces of the people who hated my family. They seemed foreign, and at first I didn\u2019t know why; of course I had little interaction with them, but I knew their faces. I saw their houses on the hill.\nThen it struck me. I had never seen the flicker of hope in their eyes, and now they watched Enah as though he were the word of God. I thought back to Fran\u00e7ois, and felt that I was standing on the edge of a cliff. I stepped up.\n\u201cHave you ever heard the words \u2019watershed management,\u2019 Miss Wolfe?\u201d Enah asked. I shook my head. \u201cDo you know what a water table is? A kund?\u201d\n\u201cI know the aquifer is drying,\u201d I said. A rumble passed from mouth to mouth in the crowd.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because this place,\u201d Enah said, and gestured over the village, \u201cis designed to waste water. It rains, and the water evaporates again. With bunds and kunds and ditches, we can train it to go back into the aquifer, and capture it from this whole land surrounding your village\u2014\u201d\nHe was interrupted by screaming.\nEnah seemed confused, but the villagers knew their screams. They broke and ran, ready to help someone bit by a snake or trapped under an ancient, crumbled wall, but what they found was Jaime, his wife crouched over him and keening, his radio smashed. My heart caught and I stepped forward, knowing what I would see\u2014and I saw that his head was lying separately to his body, the two of them connected by a sweep of bright blood.\nThen it was my turn to break away from them and run. It took the villagers a moment to work through why I was running away from them, and then a yell went up. I heard Enah\u2019s voice, nasal and rising, and then a rock crashed into the ground by my ankle. I ran faster, down into the riverbed, to the safety of the guards and Papa\u2019s dogs.\nThey came to the house in numbers that night, carrying fire. I could taste their anger on my skin. From the pumpyard the guards readied their weapons, unsure whether to run to the defense of the house or to protect the water, and Papa flogged the dogs to get them growling. \u201cWhere is Fran\u00e7ois? That worthless man! He can put down what he\u2019s stirred up or I\u2019ll have his hide nailed to my wall!\u201d\nSomething crashed against our window, and I jumped back. Papa grabbed his rifle and checked it, then made it ready to fire.\nPapa had had people murdered before. We never talked about it, but there was no secret. When I was ten, he had Fran\u00e7ois kill the bonesetter\u2019s son, and everyone knew it was him. Papa had guards and dogs and Papa had the water; the whole village hated him, but no one dared cross him. Now they dared.\nOutside the window, something was happening in the crowd. Enah ran in front of them, raising his hands. I couldn\u2019t hear his words but just his voice was beautiful, melodic like a violin, fanning the fires and banking the coals until the entire mob was singing their agreement with him, and the chant started up: Enah! Enah! Bring the river! Flood them out!\nWhen the crowd was his, he turned to our house and waved his hand until I stepped up and opened the window.\n\u201cMr. Wolfe,\u201d he called. \u201cIt\u2019s true that Jaime raised me on the radio, but you\u2019ll have to do more than kill him to drive me off. You\u2019ll have to kill me. And you\u2019ll have to kill all the people I am teaching, and you\u2019ll have to teach them not to kill you. Invite me in, Mr. Wolfe.\u201d\nQuite a thing to say, for someone who had just told my father to kill him. But Papa walked to the door, and\u2014quickly, as though the doorknob was a snake\u2014yanked it open. He invited Enah in.\nNo ancient and carefully maintained gun from the crowd shot him. No fist-sized rocks came hurtling at his head. Enah approached and the mob behind him rumbled like a single, huge beast, with fire in its many claws.\nEnah walked in, and Papa shut the door behind him.\nThey stood watching each other for a moment, these two men, Enah strange and unworldly with fire glowing on his skin, Papa holding his ground like the rocks on the riverbed. Then Enah spoke.\n\u201cAll the corpses you\u2019ve planted by your pumps,\u201d Enah said. \u201cHow long, tell me, will it take them to bloom? Will they feed your family when they do?\u201d\nPapa frowned, confused. He wasn\u2019t a good man to confuse\u2014he got angry. But instead of striking Enah or taking him by the neck, he showed his hands.\n\u201cWhy do you want to destroy me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI want to leave something for my daughter. I want to leave my wealth when I\u2019m no longer here to take care of her.\u201d\n\u201cYou can leave her a better wealth,\u201d Enah said, and gestured to the dry riverbed.\n\u201cIt will dry up. You don\u2019t understand this village; people don\u2019t learn. If they\u2019re given abundance, they\u2019ll bleed it dry. If I control the water, everyone gets what they need; no one takes more than their fair share.\u201d\n\u201cPeople learn when they are taught,\u201d Enah said. \u201cWhen they create with their own hands. They will love the river even as you love your daughter.\u201d\n\u201cYou are naive,\u201d father said.\n\u201cAnd you are stubborn,\u201d said Enah.\nPapa brushed off his hands. \u201cI would rather be stubborn,\u201d he said, but there was a moment when he seemed to consider it. The costs, and the risks, and the damages. But Papa has never been one to back down. \u201cI\u2019m done arguing with you. With a word I\u2019ll have my guards open fire on your mob. Get off of my land.\u201d\nPapa went into his office before Enah could say another word, and I caught Enah\u2019s arm before he left our house. \u201cWhy hyacinths?\u201d I asked. I kept my voice at a whisper, so Papa couldn\u2019t hear.\nEnah turned to look at me. \u201cBecause this,\u201d he said, gesturing to the riverbed, \u201cis fear in a handful of dust. Have you heard that poem? The Waste Land?\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t, but if there was ever a wasted land, this was it.\n\u201cHow much of that world we have forgotten,\u201d Enah said, and shook his head. I understood why people crowded around him like a prophet: he promised beautiful things, and kept them in mind of how strange he was, how little they knew.\nI followed him to the fence around the property, where he went out by the gate and faced the crowd. The mob watched, ready to burn me, but I felt safe in Enah\u2019s shadow. A girl guided through a lions\u2019 den.\n\u201cThose of you who\u2019d see the river run,\u201d he called. \u201cCome at midnight to the highest part of the bank. We\u2019ll gather there and begin: with your own hands and your native rock, we\u2019ll build tanks and dams and bund walls. Little by little, the water will rise. We will name the first wall \u2019Jaime\u2019.\u201d He turned, faced our house, and seemed to speak straight to Papa. \u201cAnd the water will rise.\u201d\nHe looked at me, and I ran back inside.\nPapa must have heard him through the walls. He was sitting at his desk with his head in his hands, and his face\u2014what I could see of it\u2014was red.\nHe looked to me, eyes dry and veined. \u201cIf they gather I\u2019ll have Fran\u00e7ois and my boys cleave them apart,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right that they should try to take the river. There was no law here so our family made the law. May you never have to make such a decision.\u201d\nWe were both silent for a while, and I said, \u201cHyacinths don\u2019t grow on clay.\u201d\nPapa\u2019s eyes bugged. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat sort of nonsense have they put in your head? Hyacinths!\u201d He stood. \u201cI\u2019ve raised a beautiful girl on this land, and by God I\u2019ll leave my wealth for her when I die. Wealth is all you can ask for in a God-forsaken place like this.\u201d\nI bit my teeth. My mind was full of blood and flowers, and the back of my tongue was dry. Papa glared for a minute, then the heat went out of him.\n\u201cApologize to me, Lena,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m only trying to protect you.\u201d\nI\u2019d lived long enough that I knew there\u2019d be no peace in the household until I did.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe nodded. For a while he stared out the window, into the distance, his dogs at his ankles.\n\u201cWater,\u201d he said.\nI went into the kitchen.\nI pulled a quart down from the cupboard, and felt the clean weight of it. Wealth, here, sucked out of the dirty riverbed.\nI brought it back to the office, and Papa drank like a man thirsty since the days of the Flood. I watched the water disappear into his body.\nHe set it down and looked at me.\n\u201cLena,\u201d he said. \u201cDrink up and go to bed. Keep your eyes closed. I\u2019m going to roust the boys.\u201d\nI went into my room and closed my eyes, and imagined blood sprayed across the riverbed. Papa went out to the pumps, and I could hear his voice, and then the rasp of stones sharpening machetes. I counted my breaths. Fifty, eighty, and the guards began to speak to each other, binding their resolve in boasts and quiet banter.\nThen, I snuck outside.\nThe sky was dark, and the electric lamps from the pumpyard didn\u2019t cast light as far as the door. The riverbanks reared high above me to either side.\nI thought, What happens if the water rises?\nBut then, that wasn\u2019t the right question.\nWhat happens if the water never rises?\nThe ground cracks. Skin cracks. Bones crack.\nOn my birthdays I was allowed the extravagant gift of a bath. When Mama was alive, she\u2019d sit at the side of the tub and wash my back. My entire body felt light, then. I think buoyant is the word\u2014a word I had little use for. I wanted the river to roll down from wherever it was hiding, to catch me, carry me away. I wanted buoyancy.\nI ran for the bank.\nNot far from my door a figure stood up from the shadow of my fence. I stopped quick and saw Fran\u00e7ois, silhouetted against the wide white light of the moon.\n\u201cFran\u00e7ois,\u201d I said. My voice cracked. I wondered: if he hacked off my head, how long would my blood stain the riverbed? Would Enah bring the waters and wash it away?\nFran\u00e7ois offered his left hand. In his right, his machete gleamed.\nI took a step back, but I gathered my courage and looked toward the high part of the bank. I kept my eyes on the gathering lights there as I said, \u201cAre you going to tell Papa, or just cleave me?\u201d\nFran\u00e7ois was silent for a moment. Then, \u201cI said that my parents would not be proud of what I do,\u201d he said. \u201cLena, I am not proud. God is not proud. I hardly know him, even when I want to pray.\u201d\nI swallowed. In all the years Papa had paid him, he had never called me by name. \u201cI don\u2019t have anyone to pray to,\u201d I said.\nHe offered his left hand. Again, I hesitated.\n\u201cFran\u00e7ois,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat will happen if the water rises?\u201d\n\u201cLife will return to the river valley,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m lucky, I will never again cleave off anyone\u2019s head.\u201d\nMy heart raced. \u201cSo you want the water to rise?\u201d\nHe offered his left hand.\nI stepped forward, this time. Close enough to see that his eyes were rimmed with salt, like the blood on Mogul\u2019s nose.\nOur blood will crack. Our tears will crack.\nI ran forward and wrapped my hand in his.\nHis hand closed around mine, larger than mine, warmer, strong. \u201cYour father will have us hunted,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, you shouldn\u2019t come.\u201d\nI was afraid. Of him, of the guards, of the villagers, of the flood. Of Papa, of Papa\u2019s dogs, of being cut off from the pumps. Of dying like Mogul. Of dying like Jaime. But I went up on my toes and kissed Fran\u00e7ois on the cheek, and he accepted it like a man made of stone.\nThen he said, \u201cCome,\u201d and we walked up the bank. Toward the lights, where the wind scattered Enah\u2019s lilacs, and I imagined hyacinths on the breeze.\nAn (pronounce it \"On\") Owomoyela is a neutrois author with a background in web development, linguistics, and weaving chain maille out of stainless steel fencing wire, whose fiction has appeared in a number of venues including Clarkesworld, Asimov's, Lightspeed, and a handful of Year's Bests.

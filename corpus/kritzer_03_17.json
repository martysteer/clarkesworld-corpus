Pierre, South Dakota, I mean, I wasn\u2019t trying to get to someone named Pierre. I was trying to get to my parents, and Pierre was where they lived. I thought maybe, given that the world was probably ending in the next twenty-four hours, they\u2019d want to talk to me.\n I\u2019d taken back roads almost the whole way from Spokane, hoping to avoid the traffic jams. I also figured that out-of-the-way gas stations would run out of gas less quickly. That turned out to be true for a while. The problem was that the back-roads gas stations weren\u2019t getting deliveries, either. The last gas I\u2019d found was in Billings. If they\u2019d let me fill up, I might have been able to make it all the way to Pierre on that tank, but the owner, who was overseeing the line with a large gun hanging over his shoulder, was only letting people buy eight gallons per car. Admittedly, that was probably the only reason they weren\u2019t completely out.\n I turned my car off and checked my map. Belle Fourche was just twelve miles from I-90. I didn\u2019t know exactly how much gas I still had, but the low fuel light had been on for a while and I wasn\u2019t sure I could make it that far. I tried calling the gas stations along the interstate, but of course no one was picking up. If you had sixteen hours left to live, would you spend that time working at a gas station?\n I rubbed my eyes, numb with fatigue and fear. If nothing else, maybe I could find somewhere in Belle Fourche to get coffee.\n Subway and Taco John\u2019s had fallen victim to the \u201cwould you go to your job if you maybe had 16 hours left to live\u201d problem, but I saw the lights on in Patty\u2019s Place, a wood-framed building with a sign out front advertising REAL BBQ EVERYDAY, RIBS THURS NITE. The sign said to seat yourself. I looked around and finally spotted an empty spot in a corner by the window. Even just sitting down in a seat that didn\u2019t have a steering wheel in front of it made me realize how exhausted I was. Possibly I should have taken a few more naps. Or a longer nap at some point.\n There was a TV in the corner with CNN on. The talking heads were arguing the asteroid\u2019s projected trajectory, and whether the worst-case scenarios were actually too grim. The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was probably 10 km across. This one was 4.36 km. Big enough to cause devastating damage, but the scientist on the left thought it might just wipe out coastal cities but allow the inland areas to rebuild. The other scientist thought that encouraging people to migrate inland before the strike was a terrible idea because people were dying in their desperate attempts to escape the coasts, and this was completely unnecessary if the asteroid missed us. And if it didn\u2019t, anyone who survived the strike would die in the fifty-year famine caused by the dust cloud blocking out all sunlight. \u201cSeriously, folks, just hunker down wherever and wait to see what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd hey, if we survive this, maybe consider re-opening the Arecibo Observatory, if it hadn\u2019t lost funding we\u2019d be able to map the trajectory\u2014\u201d His voice was rising, furious.\n \u201cCoffee, hon?\u201d\n I looked up at the waitress. \u201cYeah, thanks. And thanks for coming to work.\u201d\n She poured me a mug of coffee. \u201cI\u2019m actually Patty, the owner. I figured I might as well come in and feed people as stay home feeling sorry for myself. Do you know what you want? I should warn you we\u2019re out of a few things.\u201d\n \u201cI think I feel like breakfast,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI can bring you a big plate of pancakes and syrup. We\u2019re out of bacon and sausage. If you want eggs, we\u2019re down to those cartons of just egg whites but we could make those into an omelet for you.\u201d\n \u201cPancakes and syrup sounds good,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou come far?\u201d\n \u201cFrom Spokane. I\u2019m trying to get to Pierre but I ran out of gas.\u201d\n I leaned my head against the window and closed my eyes. Maybe someone else was heading east, and I could beg a ride from them. Maybe someone in town would sell me the gas out of the car in their garage. Maybe maybe maybe. I wasn\u2019t really in any shape to drive any further. Pierre was just a couple hours away, and there was a Super 8 across the street; maybe I could get a room and nap for a few hours before I tried driving any further. It was probably just as well if I got home right before the impact, if I wanted Mom to talk to me.\n The coffee was exactly like I remembered South Dakota coffee. Dip a bean three times in the hot water and call it good.\n \u201cHon, can I put two more people at your table? Your food\u2019s going to be a while but I\u2019ll keep the coffee coming.\u201d\n I opened my eyes and looked up at Patty, and the two people standing behind her. \u201cSure.\u201d They slid into the booth across from me.\n They were an older couple. Well, middle-aged, I guess. The man had white hair; the woman had reddish hair.\n \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been driving for a while,\u201d the woman said, sympathetically. \u201cYou can go back to your nap, if you want.\u201d\n It felt a little too uncivilized to ignore people sitting across from me, and besides, Patty had refilled my coffee. \u201cMy name\u2019s Lorien,\u201d I said. \u201cOr Kathleen. I mean, Kathleen\u2019s the name my parents gave me.\u201d\n The couple exchanged a look I couldn\u2019t quite untangle, and I tried to sit up a little straighter. \u201cI\u2019m Robin,\u201d the woman said, \u201cAnd this is Michael. And if Lorien\u2019s your name, it doesn\u2019t really matter to me what your parents called you.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of out of Lord of the\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re among nerds,\u201d Robin said, \u201cWe got it.\u201d\n Michael was looking at the menu. \u201cI wonder if they\u2019ll have the caramel rolls,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a picture of the caramel roll in one of the reviews, but I bet everyone\u2019s wanted caramel rolls . . . \u201d\n \u201cThat seems likely,\u201d Robin said. \u201cHave you eaten anything here, Lorien?\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cI ordered pancakes but they haven\u2019t come yet.\u201d\n Patty came by. They were indeed out of caramel rolls but they had a caramel bread pudding. They were also out of hamburger buns, although they could offer you a hamburger on sliced bread. Michael ordered a hot turkey sandwich, Robin ordered meatloaf.\n \u201cI bet they made the bread pudding out of those hamburger buns,\u201d Robin said when Patty had left.\n \u201cThat seems like a questionable business decision,\u201d Michael said.\n \u201cI bet they made the bread pudding out of those hamburger buns because someone in the kitchen thought, \u2018screw good business decisions, I want to eat something sweet and comforting and we\u2019re out of caramel rolls.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cAre you heading east?\u201d I blurted out. They seemed like really nice people. Like people who might give me a ride.\n \u201cOh, honey, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Robin said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming from Minnesota and heading to Yellowstone, actually.\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re coming from the west, maybe you know where we could find gas?\u201d Michael asked me.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t found gas since Billings, that was five hours ago, and they\u2019re rationing,\u201d I said.\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s promising,\u201d Robin said, and pulled out her phone to look up the map. \u201c . . . Totally not on our way, though. Hmm.\u201d\n \u201cI was really hoping we\u2019d find some here,\u201d Michael said.\n \u201cWhy are you going to Yellowstone?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never been there,\u201d Michael said. \u201cFigured we might as well go check it out.\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t want to be with family?\u201d\n \u201cWe said goodbye to my family before we left,\u201d Michael said.\n \u201cAnd Michael\u2019s family is my family,\u201d Robin said. \u201cFamily 2.0.\u201d\n I must have looked a bit shocked, because Robin glanced at Michael and shrugged a little. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first Armageddon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could say it\u2019s my third.\u201d\n Patty arrived with my pancakes, plus sodas for Robin and Michael. Once the pancakes were in front of me, I realized that I was ravenous. Someone had turned up the TV in the corner: a new scientist was on, a guy named Scott Edward Shjefte, who was reminding everyone that in cosmological terms, an asteroid passing between the earth and the moon was a \u201cdirect hit\u201d and yet there were 363,104 kilometers for a 4.36 kilometer object to pass through. \u201cImagine throwing a penny at a football field and trying to miss the 30-yard line. You\u2019d feel pretty good about those odds.\u201d\n \u201cNot so much if the world was going to end if the penny hit the 30-yard line,\u201d the host said. \u201cBesides, this asteroid\u2019s already beaten the odds, being spotted so late.\u201d\n \u201cSo it would have to beat the odds twice!\u201d Shjefte said. He sounded committed to this idea, not like he was grasping at straws, but the host didn\u2019t look at all convinced.\n They agreed again that everything would be better if the Arecibo Observatory was still running, since the radio telescope there could have determined the asteroid\u2019s trajectory with actual precision, and also, that the President\u2019s order to launch nukes at the asteroid wouldn\u2019t have done anything even if they hadn\u2019t missed.\n \u201cDo you think I\u2019m panicking over nothing?\u201d I said.\n Robin looked me over. \u201cHow old are you? You look about twenty five.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m twenty-three.\u201d\n \u201cMy first Armageddon was when I was a little kid, back in the 1970s. Have you ever heard of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019re the people who knock on your door.\u201d\n \u201cI was raised in the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, and when I was little, everyone at my church believed that the world was going to end in October of 1977. A lot of the adults sold their houses. My parents didn\u2019t, but my father used up all his vacation time to take days off and knock on people\u2019s doors.\u201d She took a sip of soda and leaned back against her seat. \u201cHe used to take me around with him, because people are a little less likely to slam the door on a cute little kid. Only a little, though. It was hard. My Dad used to tell me \u2018just keep walking, just keep knocking,\u2019 that eventually people would listen. That actually stood me in good stead years later when I was trying to get jobs in theater.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cDid you grow up in a church?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThe kind that believed in the Rapture and stuff?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, but we didn\u2019t have a\u2014a date, you know, when everyone thought it would happen. Just, like, soon.\u201d\n \u201cAre you still a member?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said, and ducked my head over my pancakes. After a minute, Robin went on.\n \u201cI am a male-to-female transsexual. When I was little, and people would talk about the earthly paradise, I knew I\u2019d receive a resurrected body and anything wrong with it would be miraculously fixed, but I couldn\u2019t ask, did that mean I\u2019d get a girl\u2019s body? Or that I\u2019d stop wanting a girl\u2019s body? Because both options were actually terrifying to me at that point. One meant that my parents would find out, since of course they\u2019d be in paradise with me, and the other meant I\u2019d somehow be someone else.\u201d\n I had looked up when she said \u201ctranssexual,\u201d looking her over without really meaning to. I\u2019d met trans women before, back home in Spokane, and I was looking at her because I was wondering if this should have been obvious to me and I was just that tired. There are places where if you meet someone you know they\u2019re queer, but a diner in South Dakota isn\u2019t really one of them.\n \u201cAnyway. The sun rose on November 1st, and all the adults pretended that no one had ever said the world was going to end the previous month. And that was my first Armageddon.\u201d\n Robin\u2019s and Michael\u2019s food arrived. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to want some of the bread pudding,\u201d Robin told Patty, \u201cwhen I\u2019m done with this.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve also got a big pineapple upside-down cake that\u2019s coming out of the oven right now,\u201d Patty said.\n \u201cOh, excellent, I\u2019ll have that!\u201d Michael said.\n \u201cAnyway, you can probably guess why Michael\u2019s family is my family,\u201d Robin said.\n \u201cDid they disown you for being trans?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cNo, they disowned me for leaving the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and majoring in Theater and then when I came out as gay that would definitely have been the last straw, only they hadn\u2019t spoken to me in years already at that point. Robin is actually my birth name, but I changed my last name after that. My last name is Raianiemi. It was the last name of one of my neighbors. The only lesbian in the town where I grew up.\u201d\n I couldn\u2019t really answer that at all. Patty had refilled my coffee again so I put the mug up where it sort of hid my face and drank coffee.\n \u201cMy second Armageddon was when I almost died from a mysterious infection about a decade ago,\u201d Robin said. \u201cI was in the hospital and they were giving me IV antibiotics but I wasn\u2019t responding and they thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die.\u201d\n \u201cI feel like calling that an Armageddon is kind of cheating,\u201d Michael said. \u201cYou thought you were going to die. But in an Armageddon, everyone dies.\u201d\n \u201cI really think the biggest difference is the level of hassle,\u201d Robin said. \u201cEach individual thinks they\u2019re going to die. The problem is that when it\u2019s everybody, this means huge numbers of people don\u2019t show up for work, so everyone runs out of gas just as they\u2019re trying to make road trips to see loved ones or visit Yellowstone or whatever.\u201d\n \u201cDid they ever figure out what you had?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cEnough that they were able to treat me. But I spent a few days thinking about what I\u2019d most regret, if I died that week, and I knew the thing I\u2019d really regret was never living as my real self. Never living as a woman. The thing was, I had a partner\u2014that\u2019s what we called our spouses before we could get legally married, I don\u2019t know if kids these days remember that\u2014and I had no idea how he would react and he was the love of my life. Coming out the first time, as gay, that was scary. Coming out the second time, as trans? Made me realize just how much scarier it could be.\u201d\n \u201cBut it was okay. Don\u2019t forget to tell her that part,\u201d Michael said, and squeezed Robin\u2019s hand.\n \u201cYeah, it was all okay. Anyway, once you\u2019ve survived Armageddon twice, a third one rolls around and you say to yourself, \u2018What would I like to see in case this is it?\u2019 and we knew we could get to Yellowstone so we gave all our nieces and nephews a big hug and hit the road.\u201d\n I\u2019d eaten the last of my pancakes and my coffee cup was empty. Patty hadn\u2019t been by in a while.\n \u201cWe really thought we\u2019d be able to find gas, though,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIf we stuck to the back roads . . . \u201d\n \u201cThat was my theory, too,\u201d I said. \u201cIt worked at first.\u201d\n \u201cSo where are you headed?\u201d Robin asked.\n \u201cPierre,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s where my parents live.\u201d\n \u201cDo they know you\u2019re coming?\u201d\n It was an odd question, and I knew I\u2019d betrayed myself, listening to her story. \u201cNo,\u201d I said. It came out in a whisper.\n \u201cWhen was the last time you and them talked at all?\u201d\n \u201cAfter I graduated college, they were really mad that I wasn\u2019t going to move back home.\u201d\n \u201cThat was all it took, huh?\u201d Robin asked.\n \u201cYeah. There\u2019s a lot of other stuff they\u2019d be mad about, but they just don\u2019t even know about it, unless someone\u2019s told them. Which maybe someone has.\u201d\n \u201cListen,\u201d Robin said. \u201cThere are a lot of people who will tell you that you have to reconcile with your family, that you only get one, that if you never speak to your parents again this is somehow on you, and I am here to tell you that this is crap. You don\u2019t have to reconcile with your family. You can find a family that accepts you for who you are instead of trying to cram you into the box they think you\u2019re supposed to live in. And if they choose to reject you, that\u2019s on them.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered.\n Robin pulled some Kleenex out of her purse and handed it to me. I wiped my eyes and looked out the window at the sunny afternoon.\n \u201cJust \u2018cause they raised you, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to give them the opportunity to slam another door in your face,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone else to go see,\u201d I said. \u201cMy girlf\u2014\u201d I choked off the word, then checked myself. \u201cMy girlfriend and I broke up a few weeks ago and none of my friends out there are super close. I moved to Spokane for a job and I kind of hate it and I thought, \u2018I should go see my family\u2019 and so I went.\u201d\n I had felt so alone, listening to the news in my little apartment. And I\u2019d tried calling home, and they hadn\u2019t picked up. So like everyone else, I\u2019d blown off work and hit the road.\n What would I regret? \u201cI would regret not reconciling with my family\u201d seemed like an obvious answer, so I\u2019d decided to try.\n \u201cDid you pass through Yellowstone on your way east?\u201d Michael asked.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cEven if I\u2019d taken I-90 I\u2019d have passed north of it.\u201d\n \u201cWant to come see Yellowstone with us?\u201d Robin asked. \u201cIt has Old Faithful.\u201d\n \u201cAnd a supervolcano that could blow up at any time,\u201d Michael said. \u201cSo even if the asteroid misses us completely we could still potentially die in a cataclysmic disaster today!\u201d\n \u201cYou can still say no,\u201d Robin said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to have to go door-knocking to try to find gas. You be the cute kid and we\u2019ll split whatever we can find.\u201d\n Robin was being generous, because Michael\u2019s plan was to offer cash\u2014$10/gallon for whatever they\u2019d let him siphon out, and if they balked at that, he\u2019d try upping it to $20. We walked around Belle Fourche, knocking on doors. Mostly no one answered. We did find one person who was also out of gas, which was the only reason she was still in Belle Fourche and not on her way to Cheyenne, Wyoming to see her granddaughter, and someone who had a full tank but flat-out refused to sell us any. (\u201cBank notes won\u2019t be worth a damn thing if that asteroid hits. I need a full tank to get out of here, if I have to.\u201d)\n \u201cI think we\u2019re stuck here,\u201d Robin said, after we\u2019d been knocking on doors for ninety minutes with no luck.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the attitude that got you theater jobs,\u201d Michael said.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. At this point, I\u2019m thinking that what I\u2019d like to do with my maybe-last-day-on-earth is not knock on doors all afternoon. Let\u2019s see the local sights, if there are any.\u201d\n Belle Fourche\u2019s big thing, if you can call it that, is the Geographic Center of the United States, which was recalculated by the National Geodetic Survey after the addition of Alaska and Hawaii. (The center of the lower 48 is in Kansas, which is probably about where you\u2019d expect it.) The actual technical true Geographic Center is about twenty miles out of town, but there was a Monument with a nice sculpture a mile walk from Patty\u2019s Place, so we walked over to the Center of the Nation Monument and I took a picture of Robin and Michael together, and then they took a picture of me.\n One of the parks had a playground and there were some families there with kids and dogs. I wondered if the kids knew anything about what was going on. Even if their parents didn\u2019t tell them about it, they were probably overhearing stuff from the TV and the radio. Still, they were running around and looking like they weren\u2019t worrying about it.\n Robin and Michael decided to book a room at the Super 8 and encouraged me to book one, too. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t all die, everyone\u2019s going to think, \u2018oops, didn\u2019t die, better find a room,\u2019 and you\u2019ll be glad you have one. And if we do all die, you won\u2019t have to pay your Visa bill.\u201d There was an older man working the front desk; I wondered if he was the owner, like Patty. He gave us our keys. I tucked mine in my pocket and then, for lack of anywhere else to go, we walked back across the street to Patty\u2019s.\n Patty\u2019s had gotten more crowded; people were getting tables and just camping out there. But there was an awkward little table for three in a corner she squeezed us into and we ordered more drinks and more food and settled in. \u201cProbably for the duration,\u201d Robin admitted.\n \u201cA lot of people are doing that,\u201d Patty said, looking around. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s about half people like you who got stranded here today when they ran out of gas, and half locals who don\u2019t want to sit at home. People were coming and going for a while but now they\u2019re just coming. No one wants to be alone tonight, I guess.\u201d\n The asteroid was going to hit, or miss, at 9:34 p.m. Belle Fourche time. It took a little over 3 hours to drive from Belle Fourche to Pierre, so as the clock ticked toward 6 p.m., I knew my decision had more or less been made for me.\n But then Patty came bustling over, an older couple in tow. \u201cAre you the girl who was trying to get to Pierre? Because these folks are going to Pierre to see their daughter and they have enough gas they\u2019ll probably make it, they think.\u201d\n \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t mind dogs,\u201d the woman said, \u201cBecause you\u2019ll have to share the back seat with our two beagles.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the address in Pierre?\u201d the man asked, and punched my parents\u2019 address into his phone. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s almost right on our way.\u201d\n I imagined knocking on my parents\u2019 door. Waiting for the answer, like we\u2019d done with all the people we\u2019d tried to buy gas from. My parents\u2019 house had a peephole, and you could hear their footsteps inside so you knew they\u2019d come to the door and were peering out at you, deciding whether to open up. I\u2019d know Mom was looking at me, measuring me with her eyes, looking at my short-cropped hair, the frayed collar of my shirt, assessing whether I was penitent. Penitent enough.\n I could see myself standing on that front step, in the dark, these nice people waiting to see me safe inside, until I had to turn around and admit it wasn\u2019t going to open.\n Or if it did . . .\n What I wanted was to see my parents smile. What I wanted was for them to welcome me.\n Did I really think that news of an impending asteroid would have changed who my parents were? Who they needed me to be?\n I turned and looked at Robin and Michael. They gave me hesitant smiles, like they didn\u2019t want to discourage me from leaving, but like they were biting their tongues. I could see Robin furrow her brow, like she was imagining the same things I was and they worried her.\n I turned back to the people with the beagles. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very kind offer, but I thought about it and I\u2019ve decided to stay here for the night. Thanks, though.\u201d\n They headed out. I settled back into my seat. Robin said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re staying.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m glad I have someone to stay with,\u201d I said.\n At 9 p.m. everyone went outside to the parking lot.\n It was dark out. Someone from the town had dragged out a box of fireworks left over from last year\u2019s 4th of July and everyone took turns lighting them off, including me. (Mom had never let us have fireworks when I was a kid, because we might blow ourselves up, but if there was ever a time for YOLO, it\u2019s when there\u2019s a 4.3 kilometer asteroid on a collision course for earth.) Some of the stale fireworks fizzled and went out. Others shot up into the sky and gave us a shower of sparkles. Despite how nervous everyone was, things took on a weird, almost festive air. Maybe we were all going to die in a few minutes: might as well enjoy the show until then.\n \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll be able to see anything before it hits us?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to look like?\u201d\n \u201cOne of the scientists on the TV said it would look like a tiny star and get bigger, if it was coming towards us. We\u2019ll definitely see it coming. But it could hit the other side of the planet, and we\u2019ll have no clue.\u201d\n At 9:34, someone shouted, \u201cThere it is.\u201d\n We could see something moving in the sky. It wasn\u2019t very big, but it was definitely moving. Was it getting bigger? I realized I was holding my breath. For a second I thought it was getting bigger; a moment later I was sure it wasn\u2019t. The slightly-bigger-than-average, slightly-blurry star moved across the sky and disappeared.\n There was a long pause, and then we ran back inside the restaurant to see what they were saying on CNN.\n The optimistic scientist Shjefte was either back on, or still on. He was jumping up and down\u2014literally jumping up and down, clapping his hands\u2014screaming \u201cit missed, it missed, it missed, it missed, it missed!\u201d So apparently all his optimistic talk about throwing pennies onto a football field was bravado. \u201cI\u2019m going to call all my friends, I\u2019m going to write a book, I\u2019m going to go see Petra,\u201d he shouted, just before the TV got turned off.\n We could hear cheering from the town beyond the restaurant, and more people were setting off fireworks. Robin and Michael kissed like it was New Year\u2019s Eve. Someone at the diner had chilled a bunch of bottles of champagne and Patty popped one open, and everyone drank it out of coffee mugs, and we were all a weepy mess for a while.\n And then there was a run on hotel rooms, and I was awfully glad that Robin and Michael had suggested I get one early.\n \u201cAre you going back to Spokane?\u201d\n The gas truck had come and gone: we\u2019d waited until the line had dissipated, then filled up both our gas tanks. I must have been down to about the last quarter-cup, given how much gas I put in.\n I looked at Robin. \u201cYou know, I thought about how one of the things I\u2019d really regret, if I died, was never seeing New York. My parents acted like it was some sort of den of sin and iniquity when I was growing up, but they were wrong about a lot.\u201d\n \u201cSo wait, are you going to hit the road and drive the rest of the way east?\u201d\n I laughed. \u201cI kind of think I should go home and pack up my stuff, give notice on my lease, stuff like that. But I expect I\u2019ll be coming back this way in a few months.\u201d\n \u201cWell, let me give you our address,\u201d Robin said. \u201cYou can stay with us when you get to Minneapolis.\u201d\n \u201cThis is kind of silly,\u201d I said, \u201cbut do you mind going back to the Center of the Nation Monument for a minute?\u201d\n Someone else was there, so I didn\u2019t have to snap a selfie to get a picture of myself with Robin and Michael; they took it for me.\n The road west was wide open, and I listened to music my parents would have hated the whole way back to Spokane.\n Naomi Kritzer has been writing science fiction and fantasy for over twenty years.

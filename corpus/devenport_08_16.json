And that didn\u2019t end well, so you could say we had no good luck with it at all. But we had plenty of hope. Or I did, anyway, and I was good at talking other people into having it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed of having hope,\u201d says Furby. He holds me in his arms to comfort me. I\u2019m very grateful he got rid of the pain for me. And I\u2019m glad there\u2019s someone to hear my story. I have lost everyone else. Yet even after all that\u2019s happened, I think I still would have made the decision that brought us all here.\nWhen I won ten thousand credits in the lottery I looked at it as our ticket off Hardcase, the Planet of Chronic Losers. If we had stayed put, that money could have set my family up comfortably for several years, and Lono knows we needed some good times.\nBut good times on Hardcase don\u2019t last. We were all working ourselves to death trying to keep our heads above the water. I heard there were more opportunities on Oceana, and I had been eyeing Rent-A-Spaceship for years, with no hope of scraping together the cash for me and six other people (plus one tiny cat who was easily smuggled). Then boom, the exact amount we needed to get to Oceana falls right into my lap.\nLaamaomao was sending a wind to us from Molokai. How could we fail to catch it?\n\u201cCareful about evoking those Hawaiian gods, Maybie,\u201d Bro said. \u201cSometimes they listen, and they don\u2019t always answer the way you would like them to.\u201d Bro is my step-brother, and he only has a little Hawaiian blood, but I\u2019m just 50% myself, so who am I to argue with his advice?\nBesides, Bro was usually dead on with his warnings. Yet he let me talk him into immigrating. They all did. And our neighbors got together and threw a big Farewell party for us, and my adopted brothers Creole and Cajun cooked up a feast, because they were the best chefs in town. My little nephew Spicy showed us how well he had learned the hula. We danced and partied to all our favorite songs, from \u201cLittle Grass Shack\u201d to \u201cNow is the Hour,\u201d the Maori song about saying goodbye.\nGoodbye to good neighbors. Goodbye to No Hope. Goodbye to the virus that was just beginning to sweep the poor neighborhoods where most of us lived, so new it didn\u2019t have a name, so deadly it killed before you could make one up.\nLet\u2019s just call it the Goodbye Virus. Only it had already said Hello to us, and we didn\u2019t know it yet.\nBro was right about how the gods listen. Sometimes they don\u2019t answer the way you want. And sometimes the god who answers is not the one you thought you were talking to.\nI woke up from deepsleep feeling awful. They had warned us we would feel that way while the hibernation drugs wore off, but this was worse than I thought it would be. And I was scared\u2014as soon as the lid to my unit popped, I crawled out and looked at the Health Display.\nMabel Aweau it identified me. I checked all the readings that would indicate whether the unit had performed as it was supposed to. I worked as a nurse\u2019s aid for over twenty years, so I knew what to look for. What I found made me heartsick.\nThe readings that I hoped would be OPTIMAL all read ADEQUATE. So that pissed me off. But under GENERAL HEALTH it said: POOR; DISEASE OR PATHOGEN DETECTED.\nThe Goodbye Virus . . .\nNo one else was awake yet. I wondered if any of them would get that far. I wondered if I wanted them to, considering what we all probably had. I stumbled to the unit across from mine and looked in on my nephew. The information display on his unit said Douglas Aweau.\nAll of the readings were the same as mine\u2014including the last.\nHe was my sister\u2019s boy, just six years old. We lost her to kidney disease, not long after he was born, and I still miss her, every day. But he was my sweet reminder of everything I loved about her. He had hair the color of paprika, skin the color of cinnamon, and freckles the color of chocolate, so you know we had to called him Spicy. Wherever you found Spicy you would also find Tig, because that little cat was his best buddy.\nThey loved each other dearly. Tig was curled up under Spicy\u2019s chin, the two of them hibernating like bears through the long winter of interstellar space.\nI wish they could have stayed there. I wish they hadn\u2019t been forced out of that hibernation. They would have died without ever feeling the pain, or the sadness. But the company that sold us passage on this bucket of bolts they called a spaceship just wanted us to stay asleep long enough to be out of reach for any kind of help. Sent us out here with no food, no medicine, and a bunch of systems that only worked well enough to get us so far.\n\u201cIt was typical during your era,\u201d says Furby. \u201cThugs took advantage of so many desperate pilgrims.\u201d\nHis name isn\u2019t really Furby\u2014that\u2019s just what I call him because he reminds me of a character from one of Spicy\u2019s favorite shows, I Love Furby.\n\u201cCall me whatever you like,\u201d says Furby. \u201cMy real name is too hard to pronounce.\u201d He and the other time travelers are aliens, and not one of them looks like the other. But they all have eyes I can understand. Their eyes are full of sorrow as they keep vigil with me and listen to my final declaration.\nI stood over Spicy\u2019s unit, watching him and Tig wake up from their sleep, feeling the headache that would turn into something much worse, and I think I knew how bad it could be as soon as Spicy opened his eyes. The spark that had always belonged to him was gone. \u201cMy head hurts,\u201d he said. He frowned and examined Tig, who was also despondent.\n\u201cYou\u2019re just trying to wake up,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel better soon.\u201d But that was wishful thinking.\nCreole and Cajun woke next. They were the biggest men you ever saw, taller than my full-blood Hawaiian cousins, and as strong as the day is long. Now they could barely stand, and they had the same headache I did.\n\u201cThis thing is supposed to be able to deliver medicine to us if we need it.\u201d Creole frowned as he inspected his deepsleep unit. \u201cThese medicine pacs are empty.\u201d\n\u201cI think we got scammed,\u201d said Cajun. He had to lean against his unit because his knees were shaking.\nI hoped he wouldn\u2019t say what all we grown-ups were thinking by then\u2014not in front of Spicy. The virus had been rampaging through our neighborhood when we left it. We thought we had gotten out ahead of it. But we were wrong.\nMy cousin Akamai was the sickest one, waking up. She didn\u2019t say so, she just looked at me with eyes that were too dark, as if death was invading her through those portals. \u201cWe had to try, Maybie,\u201d she said.\nNo one called me Mabel. For as long as I can remember, it was Maybie, because I was the one who said Maybe it will get better. Maybe something good will happen. Maybe it won\u2019t be so bad.\nMaybe I\u2019m the one who got everyone killed.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d says Furby. \u201cThe virus is responsible\u2014it swept your world. It killed most of the people in the poor neighborhoods, and over 50% of the people in the rich.\u201d\n\u201cKilled,\u201d I say. \u201cAlready?\u201d\n\u201cTime is dilated, this close to Belial,\u201d he says, indicating the big display screen that\u2019s dominated by a graphic of a monstrous singularity that bends both time and space.\nAkamai and I found it in the control room when we went looking for anything that could help us, a search that turned up some awful discoveries. Like the sick bay with almost no medicine in it, the food storage cabinets that were empty. The transport company put us into deepsleep before they loaded us on the ship, so we never had a chance to see what they were really doing. Akamai and I headed for the control room, hoping we could at least call for help to Oceana, since we weren\u2019t supposed to have been awakened until we were close to our destination. But we didn\u2019t see Oceana on that screen. Instead, we found a monster called Belial. We read the name on the bottom of the display, along with a bunch of numbers that probably would have scared me if I had known what they meant. We were headed right into it.\nAkamai stood in front of the screen. She had always been a slender woman, tall and shapely, like the goddess of hula. But that spirit had fled her, and now she seemed to be floating in the graphic representing the singularity. \u201cBelial dilates time,\u201d she said. \u201cTo us it seems like minutes are going by, but back on Hardcase, years are passing.\u201d\nAkamai had a Master\u2019s degree in math, but on Hardcase she could only find low-paying jobs as a teacher\u2019s aid. She used to talk about getting her Doctorate, but there had been no money for that.\n\u201cWhat will happen to us in there?\u201d I asked.\nShe shrugged, and I could see how much that movement hurt. She rubbed the back of her neck, but gave up when it didn\u2019t seem to help. \u201cNobody really knows. Theoretically, we\u2019ll be pulled into threads, toward the singularity. But some people think these black holes are wormholes. You could end up traveling through them to another part of the galaxy, or even to another galaxy. Maybe even to another universe. Too bad we won\u2019t be alive to see that.\u201d\nI looked over my shoulder for Spicy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the sick bay with Tig,\u201d said Akamai. \u201cMaybie\u2014I need to tell you something.\u201d\nI was scared to look at her, but I made myself.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re exposed to void,\u201d she said, \u201cyou lose consciousness pretty fast\u2014way faster than you would if you drowned in water.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d I said. \u201cWhy are you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThe first thing that happens,\u201d she went on, \u201cis the saliva boils off your tongue. It feels weird, but it\u2019s not like you see in stupid movies where people\u2019s blood boils. Your skin is thick enough to hold in the gas that would escape. But the lack of pressure means you black out a lot faster, in like fifteen seconds. It\u2019s the best way to go out here if you\u2014have to go.\u201d\n\u201cWe should get back in the deepsleep units,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can hibernate until someone can find us and help us.\u201d\n\u201cGood idea.\u201d The way Akamai was standing scared me. She was in terrible pain, and she was trying to fight it. \u201cBut those units are shot. They were on their last legs when they sent us out here. The ones they showed me before we shipped were not the ones they put us in. And this is not the ship we toured.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it.\u201d The bad news was piling up so fast, I couldn\u2019t process it.\nBut Akamai had perfect clarity. \u201cWe don\u2019t have medicine to treat the virus, and we don\u2019t have enough painkiller to tough out the last stages. It\u2019s horrible, Maybie. It\u2019s similar to rabies. Spacing is our best option.\u201d\n\u201cSpacing.\u201d\n\u201cThe airlocks. Exposure to void.\u201d Akamai could barely stand. She seemed propped in place. \u201cDon\u2019t wait,\u201d she advised. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it. Just do it.\u201d\n\u201cAkamai . . . \u201d\n\u201cI love you, Maybie. I love you all so much.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d I could barely get the words out through my swollen throat. \u201cMore than anything.\u201d\nShe turned her eyes back to Belial. \u201cYou\u2019d better look in on Spicy. He\u2019s going to need help.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t want an argument, and I didn\u2019t want to give her one. Every hope I ever had was dashed to bits. And it was about to get worse.\nMaybe you think it\u2019s possible to be so full of grief, you\u2019re glad to be dying. But there\u2019s nothing glad about it. It feels inevitable, maybe even natural, but it doesn\u2019t feel good.\nI made my peace with it, though. Just because it was my only option didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t my best option. Especially after what happened to Spicy.\n\u201cPoor child,\u201d says Furby. Probably he guesses what I\u2019m about to tell him.\n\u201cTig is suffering, Spicy.\u201d L\u2019India didn\u2019t try to pet Tig. She didn\u2019t much care for cats, but she adored Spicy. She was trying to get him to see what had to be done. \u201cThis happens eventually to everybody\u2019s cat. Eventually everybody has to say goodbye to them.\u201d\nSpicy was so sick, he couldn\u2019t cry. But the way his sweet face had crumpled made it hard for me to breathe when I looked at him.\n\u201cDo we have to put him to sleep?\u201d He stroked Tig, who lay on his side, panting. L\u2019India had given Tig the last of the opiates, or he probably would have been screaming. \u201cThere was only a cat-sized dose left in this damned place,\u201d she told me.\nL\u2019India was Bro\u2019s wife. Like me, she had been a nurse\u2019s aid. Like me, she actually knew enough to be a registered nurse, and she looked pretty horrified just then. \u201cWe can\u2019t put him to sleep, honey. There are no more drugs. We\u2019ll have to put him in the airlock and blow him out. He\u2019ll die super-fast. He probably won\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\nSpicy twitched as if we had stabbed him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be scared! He won\u2019t know why I left him.\u201d He turned to me with pleading eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll be alone and scared, Maybie.\u201d\nDon\u2019t wait, Akamai had said. Don\u2019t think about it. Just do it.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t. \u201cGive him some time,\u201d I told L\u2019India. And we left Spicy alone with his Tig. And do you know what he did, Furby?\nFurby doesn\u2019t speak. He waits for me to tell him.\nThat little boy\u2014that six-year-old child\u2014picked up his kitty and went to find an airlock. And that smart boy figured out how to work the controls. He didn\u2019t want Tig to be alone. So he went out with him.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t wait for me,\u201d I told L\u2019India. \u201cI should have been in there with him.\u201d\nFurby brushes the hair back from my face. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you weren\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have found you if you had done that. We would never have known what happened.\u201d\nL\u2019India told me Akamai had already gone out by then. I figure Akamai did it right after she talked to me. By then I was sitting on the floor of the control room, staring at Belial, watching the graphic update as we got closer and closer.\nIt dilates time . . .\n\u201cHoney?\u201d said L\u2019India. \u201cMaybie? We\u2019re going, now.\u201d\nGoing? Where could they go? My eyes hurt, but I could just make her out in the doorway. She leaned heavily on the frame. \u201cIt hurts too much,\u201d she said. \u201cBro and me, and Cajun and Creole, we\u2019re\u2014\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say going again, but I finally understood what she meant. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re staying, Maybie?\u201d\nI looked at the screen again. \u201cI want to see,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat happens.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say anything. But then I heard Bro\u2019s voice. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself, Sis. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d\nI waited to hear why he thought I shouldn\u2019t do that. But that was the last thing he said to me.\nMinutes may have passed, or hours. \u201cHey L\u2019India,\u201d I called, \u201cRent-A-Spaceship did one thing they said they were going to do. They uploaded our playlist. Hey computer, play Ports of Paradise.\u201d\nThe music started with the blast of the horn from an ocean liner. And then the magical sounds of Polynesian percussion instruments ushered in the voices of sirens. \u201cPorts of paradise,\u201d they sang as we crossed Belial\u2019s event horizon, \u201cI\u2019m sailing home to you . . . \u201d\nThere is a god Puea, who is worshipped in darkness. I think he must have been the god who heard my prayers, and answered them in his own way. Was he waiting inside that singularity for me? Is he the one who showed the Travelers where to find me?\n\u201cTo us,\u201d said Furby, \u201cthis singularity is a means of travel. That\u2019s why we crossed paths with you. Once you passed the Event Horizon, you entered our wormhole. We are the Travelers. We police the timelines. We fix the damage people cause to them when they tamper with them.\u201d\nI hadn\u2019t seen him until he knelt beside me. He wasn\u2019t alone; other creatures were there too, super-smart, super-advanced aliens who did work that the god Maui, the Time Shifter, would have admired.\n\u201cI wish you could have come sooner,\u201d I complained. I was still in terrible pain.\n\u201cSooner is not just a time,\u201d said Furby. \u201cIt\u2019s also a place. And we were not in that place.\u201d\nI felt his fingers inside my head. It was like he was touching my thoughts, pulling them into strings that could be spooled and rescued from the diseased tissue around them. He said, \u201cWe will give you a happy ending, Maybie. But there\u2019s a price for this. I and my fellow Travelers have paid it. You will pay it too. You must die in this timeline. But you won\u2019t be gone.\u201d\nThe pain faded to nothing, but I didn\u2019t feel like I was getting better. I was still dying. I stood at the edge of a cliff and looked into a canyon so deep, whole worlds could get lost in there. But I wasn\u2019t scared to look down. I saw stars. It was like seeing Kane, the Godhead. At that particular juncture of time and space, I saw the timelines Furby had told me about, arching away from me and back again, like petals of the flowers woven together into a lei. I understood why the Travelers had to protect them.\n\u201cI think I am happy,\u201d I said. \u201cDying is okay. Do you think Spicy felt this way, too?\u201d\nFurby kissed my forehead. His fur tickled. \u201cYou can ask him when you see him.\u201d\nI was going to see my Spicy! If any tears had been left in me I would have cried with happiness. I just had to settle for feeling good.\nI slipped into the well of stars, and my mind floated free.\nSo I died. But then I woke up, just like I had before. I was in the deepsleep unit, but this time Furby was helping me out. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cYou and your family have been treated for the virus, and you\u2019re cured now. We fixed your ship, and you\u2019re back on track for Oceana. You\u2019ll arrive there in about one hundred fifty-two hours\u2014we called to let them know you\u2019re coming. They\u2019ll help get you settled.\u201d\n\u201cUh\u2014\u201d I heard everything he said, but I couldn\u2019t make sense of it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re well-stocked with water and nutrition bars now. We always keep extra supplies for emergencies like this.\u201d He helped me walk. My eyes focused on the deepsleep unit across from mine, the one where Spicy had slept.\nSpicy was in there with Tig.\n\u201cYou found them?\u201d I stuttered. \u201cYou\u2014found their bodies?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re alive in this timeline,\u201d said Furby. \u201cAnd so are you. We traveled back in time and implanted your memories from your experiences in the other timeline, into this body. You get a do-over, Maybie.\u201d\n\u201cI get\u2014a . . . \u201d\nThe readings on Spicy\u2019s unit said he was alive. He and Tig were alive!\n\u201cWe filled the pacs on these units with the medicine to kill the virus,\u201d said Furby, \u201cplus some other treatments we thought you should have. You\u2019ve all been well-dosed. You\u2019re cured.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t possible.\u201d I watched Spicy waking up. Tig tickled him with his wet nose, and Spicy smiled. I did cry then, because my eyes were back to normal.\nFurby turned me to face him. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this for everyone we meet, Maybie. We don\u2019t even do it for ourselves very often. We were able to do it for you because your lives are very small in the scheme of things. Your lives don\u2019t affect the timelines one way or the other.\u201d\n\u201cIf our lives are so small and unimportant, why did you bother?\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t trying to complain, I honestly felt curious.\n\u201cThey\u2019re small. But they\u2019re not unimportant. Not to us.\u201d His eyes were big and golden. They were wet too, like mine. \u201cWe could do this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we did.\u201d\nAnd I finally got it. The Travelers, time travelers, could change things as long as there was a timeline that would accommodate the changes. That\u2019s what they did for us. That\u2019s what they meant when they were talking about how we did and didn\u2019t affect the timelines.\n\u201cComputer,\u201d I said, \u201cPlay Little Grass Shack.\u201d\nThat had always been our celebration song. It played while the Travelers and I greeted my family as they woke from their deepsleep. My family had no memories from the other timeline, they didn\u2019t know about the bad things that happened. I\u2019ve never told them the worst of it.\nWe partied with the Travelers, and Spicy taught them the hula. It turned out the Traveler with the tentacles was the best at it. And when the Travelers were sure that the Immigration officials on Oceana were aware of us and were ready to accept us, they told us they would have to leave. They still had important work to do, work that involved fixing the timelines where people were abusing them.\n\u201cAloha doesn\u2019t just mean goodbye,\u201d I told them. \u201cIt means hello at the same time. So hello, Travelers. You\u2019re part of our family now. You\u2019ll always be here.\u201d I put my hand over my heart.\n\u201cAloha, Maybie.\u201d Furby put his hand over his heart, too (though it was in a different spot than mine). \u201cYou\u2019ll be glad so much time has passed since you left Hardcase. I think you\u2019ll find that your clunker of a spaceship is valuable, after all.\u201d\nAnd with that, the Travelers sparkled and vanished, like embers floating up into darkness, leaving us with wonder and delight.\nFurby was right about The Clunker. Because the original owners were long dead, we were able to claim salvage rights. Turned out on Oceana, that old ship was considered a collectible antique. We sold it and bought a nice house, better than we could have gotten on Hardcase with my ten thousand credits.\nAnd if Oceana wasn\u2019t 100% paradise 100% of the time, it was close enough for government work. L\u2019India and I both studied to become registered nurses and got good jobs at doctors\u2019 offices. Akamai got her doctorate and became the director of an observatory. Creole and Cajun became much-sought-after cooks at a fancy resort. Spicy grew up, went to college, and became a volcanologist. Oceana has a lot of volcanoes.\nBro spent most of his time surfing, which pissed L\u2019India off. But the rest of us made enough money to pay the bills, so we didn\u2019t bug him about it. We prospered, and we stayed together as a family. Even Tig stayed\u2014that little cat lived another fifty years. I think it was because of the medicine the Travelers put in the pacs for our deepsleep units\u2014they didn\u2019t just cure us of the virus. It was just like Furby said, they did what they could because they could. And what they could do was amazing.\nThis is all that I hoped for when I blew my ten thousand credits to get us off Hardcase. But Bro\u2019s advice about evoking the gods comes back to haunt me every morning, when I rise and remember what it felt like to wake up sick, what it felt like to find Spicy and Tig gone\u2014what it felt like to crouch in front of the screen that displayed hungry Belial and to die like a sick dog\u2014to hear my dear ones telling me, We\u2019re going now, knowing that they were killing themselves.\nNow is the hour\nWhen we must say goodbye.\nThis duality of happy and sad, joy and grief, success and failure doesn\u2019t surprise me. It\u2019s pono, balance. It\u2019s the price I pay for what I did and what I failed to do.\nSoon you\u2019ll be sailing\nFar across the sea.\nI can never forget how we suffered and grieved. We despaired and we rejoiced. We died and we survived. Our current lives are woven together with the ones that ended so badly, just like time and space are woven together. I don\u2019t take anything for granted, because of those memories. And if I\u2019m not exactly happy to have them, I understand why they\u2019re necessary. The gratitude I feel for our second chance has never dimmed.\nWhen I lay dying in the control room, and I thought about my family, I listened to that Maori song, \u201cNow is the Hour\u201d and cried tears I could no longer spare.\nBut now when I hear that song, I think of Furby and the other Travelers.\nWhile you\u2019re away, oh then, remember me.\nWhen you return you\u2019ll find me waiting here.\nAfter all, they\u2019re time travelers.\nAnd we said aloha, not goodbye.\nNine of Emily's novels were published in the U.S. By NAL/Roc, under three pen names.

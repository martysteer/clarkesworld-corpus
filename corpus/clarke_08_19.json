We started using that system in 2009, so it took about six years. Just under four years later, we passed the one hundred thousand mark, so I decided to jump back into our database and see how things have changed since then.\nAs before, there were a lot of ties, so the list below contains the twenty-two story titles with the ten highest counts. I added two extra columns to show the similar top ten placements in the original analysis and their place when just the second fifty thousand submissions are considered.\nTitle\nOverall\nFirst 50K\nSecond 50K\nHome\n1\n2\n4\nThe Hunt\n1\n6\n1\nThe Box\n2\n3\n4\nHomecoming\n3\n2\n7\nDust\n4\n1\n10\nThe Gift\n5\n2\n8\nReflections\n5\n8\n3\nMonsters\n6\n4\n8\nHunger\n6\n2\n10\nThe Interview\n7\n2\nFlight\n8\n6\n10\nAdrift\n8\n7\n9\nFirst Contact\n8\n3\nAlone\n8\n7\n7\nLegacy\n9\n7\n10\nLost and Found\n9\n5\nGoing Home\n9\n10\n7\nThe Wall\n10\n9\n9\nThe Visitor\n10\n7\nThe Other Side\n10\n9\n8\nRebirth\n10\n9\n9\nAwakening\n10\n9\n9\nSince the first report, we have three new titles breaking into the top ten: The Interview, First Contact, and The Visitor.\nMany titles lost their top ten status: Sacrifice, Heartless, The End, Red, The Visit, Broken, Voices, Genesis, The Collector, Disconnected, The Prisoner, Deus Ex Machina, Hero, Skin Deep, Memories, Skin, The Machine, The Tower, Coming Home, Rain, The Dark, Inheritance, The Door, The Choice, Happiness, Perchance to Dream, Last Call, The Fall, and Night Terrors. Only Lost and Found maintained its over top ten place without making the top ten for the second fifty thousand.\nWhat does all this mean? What it tells me is that while some titles remain very near-and-dear to a few author\u2019s hearts, overall we\u2019ve seen even more authors using unique titles. That\u2019s probably a good thing, but it does lead me into some points I ended up having to make after the first report.\n- I have never rejected a story because it had a common (or even a terrible) title.\n- I don\u2019t give any thought to the title before I\u2019ve decided to purchase a story.\n- Changing a title is easy, so if I don\u2019t like it, I can have that discussion with the author.\n- There are plenty of good stories and bad stories with those titles. The title is not what made them good or bad.\nThat said, unlike previous data-based editorials, this was done strictly for the fun of it. The only statistic worth noting this time, is that duplicated titles represent a small minority\u2014less than 10%\u2014of all submissions to Clarkesworld. That\u2019s a pleasant surprise. It doesn\u2019t even pass 20% when you remove all the common variations that come by adding the, an, a, etc. to the title.\nSince we\u2019re having fun, I\u2019ll leave you with this: I took every story title ever received by Clarkesworld and dropped it into Wordle to produce the following visual representation of the top 150 words used in titles (minus the common English-language words). Enjoy!\nP.S. I can\u2019t let it go without comment that \u201czombies\u201d made the cut. I\u2019ve previously told you they were everywhere in the slush pile. Now that we\u2019re not accepting horror submissions, maybe that will fall off the list in time for the one hundred and fifty thousand submissions update. One can only hope.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

She has grown so much since it buried the egg-shaped pod that contained her corpse. Ninety years, seventeen days, fifteen hours, thirty-one minutes, and twelve seconds have elapsed.\nHer leaves bask in the sunbeams that filter into Flatirons Biodome, where the air always smells of petrichor due to the underground irrigation system. Together, the light and water have caused her to grow tall.\n\u201cIf only I could be like you.\u201d The droid puts its hand against her sturdy trunk and rubs, consoling its friend. \u201cWhen I die, my body will linger and rust. I won\u2019t become something new, like you, not until long after the humans of the Earth are gone. Now, you drop seeds that grow into trees, or feed the birds, and you transform carbon dioxide into oxygen for creatures to breathe. You make the world a more habitable place, just by existing.\u201d The droid presses its lips into a line. \u201cYou are perfect. If only we droids were the same, I would\u2014\u201d\nThe droid shuts its mouth when it notices a stranger watching from nearby.\nIn their right hand, they hold an antique brass oblong. With a repeating cadence, they push it open, flick a switch that ignites a flame reaching several inches into the air, and then close the device, extinguishing the fire. Their left hand fidgets with a lit cigarette. They raise it to their lips and inhale while staring at the droid with an uncanny lack of expression. Puffy red flesh surrounds their eyes. Long straight black hair is unkempt and split at the ends.\n\u201cHazard. Open flames are prohibited inside the biodome,\u201d the droid says, \u201cand so is smoking.\u201d\nThe stranger shoves the oblong into their pocket, then drops the cigarette onto the ground and stamps it out.\n\u201cThank you for your compliance,\u201d the droid says. \u201cHow can I be of assistance?\u201d\n\u201cCarry on.\u201d\n\u201c . . . Please clarify. I do not understand.\u201d\nThe stranger waves their hand in the droid\u2019s direction. \u201cKeep doing what you were doing. Talk to that gravetree.\u201d\n\u201c . . . My pleasure, human.\u201d\n\u201cZoe Huang, she.\u201d The stranger overrides her prior directive by walking up and extending her hand. It trembles slightly.\nThe droid clasps her hand and bows. \u201cModel number: zero nine two six. Function: carrion recycling.\u201d\n\u201cOK. But do you have a name?\u201d\nThe droid\u2019s eyes shift rapidly from side to side as it processes the question. \u201cModel number: zero nine two six.\u201d\nZoe huffs. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna call you Rob. That alright?\u201d She snickers.\nThe droid Rob doesn\u2019t understand why. Regardless, it bows again and says, \u201cI\u2019m honored to be named by a human. Please excuse any improper etiquette I display. I rarely converse with people. My neural networks that handle interactions may be under-trained. I apologize if my language is stilted, incoherent, or incorrect.\u201d\nZoe dismisses Rob\u2019s apology with a wave, then looks at Aanya Ruiz. \u201cDid you know her when she was alive or something?\u201d\n\u201cShe is still alive.\u201d\n\u201cI mean; did you know her when she was aliiive? Like, as a human, not a tree.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I did not have the pleasure of knowing Aanya Ruiz when she was in human form.\u201d\nZoe sucks on the inside of her cheek for a moment before releasing it with a smack. \u201cThen how do you know it would be a pleasure knowing her?\u201d\nThe response comes from Rob as if with urgency: \u201cBecause Aanya Ruiz was human.\u201d\nZoe blinks, then sputters out a half-laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Just being human makes someone pleasant?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nCreases form on Zoe\u2019s face. A sheen coats her eyes, and her gaze drifts elsewhere. \u201cDo you treat them all this way?\u201d her voice wavers. \u201cThe gravetrees?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I do.\u201d\nZoe smiles pitifully. \u201cWho would guess bots would be so kind, so . . . optimistic? I knew someone else like that, once. Not that long ago, actually. But it sure feels like an eternity since . . . Anyway, that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cYou know; I could use someone with a glass-all-full attitude in my life right now.\u201d She pulls her smile sideways into a mischievous smirk. \u201cWhat are you doing for lunch?\u201d\nThe people sitting at the dining sets outside the caf\u00e9 near the arbetery stare at Rob as it approaches, following closely at Zoe\u2019s heels. The diners\u2019 eyes glance away when Rob tries to meet their gazes. It is suddenly conscious of the many patches of dirt all over its bodysuit, and feels a sequence of heavy thumps in its chest. Its central processing unit starts to heat up.\n\u201cHow many?\u201d a service droid asks.\nZoe holds up a pair of fingers.\n\u201cWhen do you expect the rest of your party to arrive?\u201d\nShe frowns, then points her finger back and forth between Rob and herself. \u201cThis is the whole party.\u201d\n\u201c . . . Please follow me.\u201d\nRob and Zoe take their seats in a corner of the caf\u00e9 that seems distant from everywhere else. A chalkboard separates them from the other patrons. Doodles of flowers and trees are drawn on it, perfectly.\n\u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\nZoe counts the items she orders on her fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll have a green-chili cheeseburger with no veggies and no mayo, crispy fries, a lime soda, a coffee with cream and sugar, and a banana split with extra-hot fudge. Not extra hot fudge, extra-hot fudge. Got it?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve recorded your order. Your meal will be ready shortly.\u201d The service droid turns to leave.\n\u201cHold on a minute! Aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d Zoe nods her head toward Rob, and her voice becomes flat: \u201cYou didn\u2019t take my friend\u2019s order.\u201d\nThe service droid pauses for a moment, then turns to face Rob. \u201cWhat can I get you?\u201d\nRob doesn\u2019t know how to respond. Carrion droids don\u2019t have senses of taste. They don\u2019t have digestive systems for processing food, either. But those facts mean little when Zoe, a human, sits there across the table staring at Rob with a broad grin across her face. Rob wants her grin to remain. \u201cI will have the same as her.\u201d\n\u201c . . . Your meal will be ready shortly.\u201d The service droid spins on its heel.\nIf Rob were unaware of the specifics of human anatomy, Zoe\u2019s particular way of consuming food would make Rob think that members of her species were capable of unhinging their jaws like snakes. Bite after bite, Zoe chomps down on her burger, causing the intermingling melts of meat-fat and cheese to drizzle down her hands and onto her plate.\n\u201cDamn, this burger is good,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than a burger without veggies to ruin it. Tomatoes? They\u2019ve got no flavor. Lettuce? All it does is water down the yummy stuff. You know what I mean? Meat, cheese, carbs, and good sauce, that\u2019s all you need.\u201d\n\u201cGreen chilies are vegetables. So are potatoes.\u201d\n\u201cBarely.\u201d She sucks the juices off each finger in turn, then arms herself with a spoon, preparing to plunge it into her banana split. The ice-cream delicacy lasts only for a short while before joining the burger, fries, soda, and coffee in her belly.\nWhen Zoe finishes, she unfolds her napkin, wipes chocolate from her lips, and then\u2014for the first time since the food arrived\u2014looks at Rob. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna eat?\u201d\nRob stares at the full dishes sitting on the gingham tablecloth in front of the droid. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I do not eat food. Sunlight is enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cThen why\u2019d you order?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to appoint you.\u201d\n\u201cAppoint me?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\u201d\nZoe blinks, then lets out a raucous laugh that causes most eyes in the caf\u00e9 to turn to her. The eyes that don\u2019t instead stare at their owners\u2019 feet. She slaps the table hard, rattling the cups, plates, and cutlery. \u201cYou\u2019re a trip!\u201d\nRob\u2019s neural networks are unable to infer the meaning of the word trip in this context.\nZoe leans halfway across the table and says, \u201cListen. You wanna get outta here? You know; dine and dash.\u201d\nRob\u2019s processing hasn\u2019t kept pace with the speed of the conversation, so Rob doesn\u2019t respond.\nZoe glances around the room. \u201cOK, no one\u2019s paying attention. You ready? One . . . two . . . three!\u201d\nIn a scramble, Zoe pushes herself out of her chair, sending it skidding backward on the tile. She sprints toward the door, wildly smiling the whole way there. She flings it open and exits without a backward glance.\nRob continues sitting at the table.\nThe service droid approaches. It shows Rob the bill on a tablet. \u201cThat\u2019ll be one hundred twenty-three dollars and twelve cents.\u201d\nRob frowns. Like nearly all public-service droids, it has no money.\nBeneath the red glow of a Rocky Mountain sunset, Rob shovels doughy earth into a heap next to the grave-site of Laxmi Gundersen, the arbetery\u2019s newest resident. Her pod, still the color of milk because it hasn\u2019t been dirtied by the soil, has condolences scrawled in children\u2019s handwriting on the exterior.\nOnly a few days ago, Rob would\u2019ve been excited to welcome a fresh somebody to the community, but today, the carrion droid is not. Feelings preoccupy its central processing unit.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Rob has had feelings; all droids feel. Their makers understand how integrally emotions regulate conscious behavior. Rob knows guilt-free tiredness after a day of hard work and the compulsion to avoid looking at a person weeping in public. More recently, Rob has experienced the warm bliss that comes when someone\u2014a human no less\u2014chooses to spend time with another, and also the tight twistedness of abandonment. The latter has lingered ever since Zoe left Rob sitting alone inside the caf\u00e9 and didn\u2019t come back.\nWhy did she leave? Rob wonders. Had the droid said something wrong, offending her? Probably. Rob was, after all, nothing more than a droid. Over and over, Rob plays back its memories of the time it spent with Zoe, but without revelation.\nWhen the carrion droid finishes digging, the sun has set, and the arbetery has become dark. There, beneath the blurred starlight penetrating the biodome, the droid feels lonely, even though its friends, the gravetrees, surround it. Perhaps it will soon have a new friend in Laxmi Gundersen, too. But that doesn\u2019t make the droid feel any better right now. The droid reflects on the way Zoe was friendly: the way she ate her food, the way she talked and laughed with her mouth full, and the way she went on tangents during conversation. Trees don\u2019t do any of those things.\nThe memories of Zoe linger in Rob\u2019s central processing unit, and as a result, instead of the excitement the droid typically experiences when burying someone, an ache pounds inside the droid\u2019s chest, hard enough that the emotion is unbearable. Exhausted, the droid lies down in Laxmi\u2019s grave-site. The cool, wet ground holds the droid, but it feels no comfort. Regardless, it stays there, because it lacks the energy to do anything else.\n\u201cDo you always sleep in graves? That\u2019s kinda weird and creepy, you know.\u201d\nRob recognizes the teasing rhythm of Zoe Huang\u2019s voice. The droid shields its eyes from the morning light slipping through gaps in the foliage. Zoe stands on the ground beside the grave looking down at Rob, once again fidgeting with her antique brass oblong.\n\u201cYou came back,\u201d Rob says. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo see you, dummy! I had to come find you after you abandoned me. Why\u2019d you let me dine and dash on my own? Seriously, you just sat there on your ass yesterday. You didn\u2019t even try to follow me.\u201d\nWhere the aching feeling has been, a sinking feeling of guilt appears. Before now, Rob hasn\u2019t considered the possibility that the droid\u2019s own actions might have caused its loneliness. \u201cI did not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhatever! Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Zoe extends a finger toward Laxmi Gundersen\u2019s pod. \u201cWho\u2019s this? Someone interesting I guess, judging by all the signatures on her pod.\u201d\n\u201cShe taught arithmetic to children.\u201d\n\u201cI never got math,\u201d says Zoe. \u201cComputers are way better at it than us people, so I say we should leave the numbers to them. Anyway . . . are you coming with me this time?\u201d\nZoe leads Rob out of the arbetery, past the houses and streets in the town of Boulder, and up the overgrown trails only tread by the engineering droids that maintain the biodome.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t know the bigness of the dome,\u201d Zoe says as she walks, between big huffs and breaths. \u201cIt looks closer than it really is, like clouds . . . or objects in a rearview. It stretches all the way up into the foothills, covering most of the Flatirons and even Bear Peak.\u201d\nRob tries to pay attention to Zoe\u2019s words, but the increasing drench of sweat on the back of her shirt distracts the droid. \u201cDo you need to rest?\u201d Rob asks.\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019m fine.\u201d With each step, Zoe places a hand on her knee to lever herself up the trail, up the mountainside. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re nearly there.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, silly. Stop asking.\u201d\nMuted, the pair hike higher into the mountains. Smooth slopes and uniform pines transform into jagged outcroppings, ornamented by firs, pi\u00f1ons, and one-seeds. The morning mists have yet to dissipate, and there\u2019s a biting chill, too, which the light from the sun does little to burn away. The stone ground is icy-slick in patches. A fresh coniferous scent hangs in the air, quite different from the mixed smell of the gravetree menagerie that Rob is used to.\nAfter climbing for a while longer, Zoe stops, rests her weight on one leg, and stares ahead. \u201cAbout damn time. We\u2019re finally here.\u201d Her words come out between exasperated puffs. \u201cWill you sit with me?\u201d\n\u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d\nNot far in front of Rob and Zoe is a place where the dome cuts deep into the earth, separating what\u2019s inside from what\u2019s outside. Inside, the dirt and stones are healthy reddish colors and the flora are vibrant and lush. Outside, the world is dead. Gray rocks rest atop gray soil. If anything at all lives beyond the dome, it\u2019s microscopic or else invisible. Without prior knowledge, Rob wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish the surface beyond the dome from the surface of the moon.\n\u201cHave you ever seen the outside before?\u201d Zoe asks.\n\u201cNo. I have not.\u201d\n\u201cBack in the day, on occasion, I came up here with a . . . friend. We\u2019d stare out there and wonder what it\u2019d be like on the other side, and how long we\u2019d last. Would bacteria eat our skin? Would we suffocate from a lack of oxygen? Would the sun instantly burn us to a crisp? Or, maybe, nothing at all would happen, and we\u2019d learn that the government was lying to everyone so it could maintain control of us, like in one of those old sci-fi books with wacky conspiracies. Then we\u2019d have to go on the run together, hunted until our dying days.\u201d Zoe bites her bottom lip. \u201cBut that was science fiction, I guess . . . just fiction.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Thankfully, the members of government have your best interest in mind.\u201d\nZoe snorts a laugh and shakes her head. \u201cYou really need to learn not to trust us humans. Not all of us are so great as you think. Maybe even most of us.\u201d She reaches into her pocket and removes the oblong, along with a cardboard package.\n\u201cHazard. Open flames are prohibited inside the biodome,\u201d the droid says, \u201cand so is smoking.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Zoe says while sticking a cigarette between her lips. She lights it. \u201cI found this pack up here, and this lighter, too, just last month. Both were in a vacuum-sealed bag. Someone must\u2019ve stashed them here before the quarantine was enforced.\u201d She sucks on the cigarette, then releases the smoke in a steady plume from between pursed lips.\n\u201cI repeat: Hazard. Open flames are not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you know why smoking isn\u2019t allowed in the dome? It\u2019s not because of cancer or anything like that. It\u2019s because the dome houses a carefully maintained, fragile, artificial ecosystem, and its oxygen levels are elevated. When designing this place, someone decided to err on the side of oxygen. Makes sense I guess; gotta have breathable air more than anything else. But now, a single misplaced spark could burn down this whole fucking bastion of humanity. I know that because my friend worked in the control room.\u201d Zoe\u2019s face becomes expressionless, and she tosses the cigarette on the ground and stamps it out as if angry. \u201cWanna know a secret?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cThe other day when we met, back when I was at the arbetery, I was there visiting my friend . . . but I wasn\u2019t just there to see them. I was . . . \u201d Zoe lets her forehead fall into cupped hands, then grumbles through muffling fingers, \u201cFuuuck. Talking\u2019s hard sometimes, you know?\u201d She rests her head in her hands for a long while, allowing a silence to creep into the conversation. Then she slides her fingers down her face, revealing red eyes and wet cheeks. \u201cBetter if I show you, I guess. This is the secret.\u201d She tosses the antique brass oblong into Rob\u2019s lap.\nThe droid stares at the object but doesn\u2019t pick it up. \u201cThis does not look like a secret. This looks like contraband.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s both.\u201d\n\u201cShould I give it to the authorities?\u201d\nZoe shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t care. All I want is for you to know that I\u2019m giving it to you. When I saw you talking so kindly to that tree by name, the one you called Aanya Ruiz, that was when I knew you were gonna be good company for my friend. After that, I had to give you this lighter, this secret. I had no other choice. It\u2019s yours. You can do whatever you want with it.\u201d\nRob looks down at the small object\u2014a gift. The droid has never received one of those before but knows that humans gift trinkets deemed special to others.\nThe sweltering heat from the sun is cooled by the climate control regulating the temperature in the biodome, but Rob pretends it can feel the star\u2019s energy burning from overhead, heavy and oppressive. The droid acts out wiping sweat from its brow, performing a task repeated thousands of times. Its shovel bites into the earth, slices deep, and then extracts a clod. The mound next to the grave-site grows slowly and steadily, not unlike the contents in the bottom half of an hourglass.\nBut today, the task of digging is more difficult than ever before.\nRob senses a pang behind its eyes and reflexively grasps the brass oblong that dangles from its neck. Feeling the cool metal, the droid is comforted. Countless hours conversing with Zoe eventually trained its neural networks well enough to understand the meaning of her secret. Rob will carry that piece of her to the end of the world.\nParker Ragland is a writer who spends most days trying to convince people that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t that scary (contrary to what some of his fiction might suggest).

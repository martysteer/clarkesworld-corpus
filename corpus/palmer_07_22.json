He is smiling.Of course, the boy knows them; he\u2019d briefly had one that had been plucked from his bedroom floor and relocated into the inventor\u2019s basement workroom almost immediately, as if his father had been lurking and waiting for the chance and the excuse to confiscate it and make it his own. The boy never understood why his father did this with \u201cgifts\u201d\u2014give and then take back\u2014but there had been several over the years: the \u201cnuclear winter\u201d snow globe, a perpetual motion silly string machine, and countless other cheaply made, cheapened down wonders that were only briefly in his possession. What the boy wants is good hiking boots, a better face filter, and the expensive skin cream that blocks radiation but doesn\u2019t make your skin sallow and greasy, but the inventor has never been one for listening except to hear what he wanted.As such, the inventor is waiting for his answer.\u201cYes,\u201d the boy says. \u201cI had one that you gave me for my birthday, and I liked it a very lot, but it disappeared.\u201d Let the old man feel guilt, if he could.\u201cYes, that. I made one even better,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cThe original, as you know, had one function, which is that when you turned it on, it would open its lid, extend a metal finger, and turn itself off again. Purely mechanical.\u201dThe inventor sets a box down on the table in front of the boy, with a loud and proud thump. The boy pushes his half-finished bowl of cereal to the side and sets his spoon beside it, and after a glance at his father, gently pulls the box closer to examine it.It is not the same box he had as a kid. This one is larger and cube-shaped, each side a little bigger than the length as his hand. Also, it's metal and wood instead of flimsy, compressed wasteboard product. But it does have a hinged lid and a switch, same as before. \u201cShall I turn it on?\u201d he asks.The inventor is impatient. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s different, first?\u201d he asks.\u201cI assumed that when I turned it on\u2014\u201d\u201cAssumptions!\u201d The inventor throws his hands up and makes a face, as if insulted.Of course, the boy thinks, if he merely observes, how can the old man brag? How can he tell me how hard he worked on it, how clever he is? It was a miscalculation not to let his father talk it through. \u201cWell, then, what is different?\u201d\u201cObserve,\u201d the inventor says and leans down and flips the switch on the box. The lid opens, and a single, blue lens stares at them from inside the box. \u201cI built a robot in there. Flipping the switch turns it on!\u201dA tiny articulated metal hand reaches out from the inside the box, extends one finger, and turns the switch off again. The hand retracts and, as the lid closes, the light in the lens fades out.\u201cOkay, it\u2019s a robot, but it\u2019s just programmed to turn itself off again?\u201d the boy asks. \u201cHow is that different?\u201dThe inventor straightens up, smiles broadly. \u201cIt\u2019s a fully functional, self-aware AI,\u201d he says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t programmed to turn itself off, it chooses to because I programmed it to be in a constant state of existential terror!\u201dThe boy looks up at his father. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of awful,\u201d he says.\u201cIt\u2019s funny. It\u2019s brilliant!\u201d the inventor says. \u201cWhat better metaphor for our own lives? This, my boy, is art.\u201dThe boy picks up his spoon again and finishes his breakfast, considering to what extent he and the box were similar, after all, two lives subject to one man\u2019s whims.He expresses no more interest in the box, but by the time his father has harrumphed off back to his lab, dissatisfied with his audience, the boy has already decided he is going to steal it.[1]Location: outdoors, unknown.Observe: New human individual. Tagging as Human2.[0]\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d his friend says, when the boy explains the box. \u201cI mean, why?\u201d\u201cBecause my father\u2019s a total asshole, mostly,\u201d the boy says. \u201cWhy does he do anything? To show off and be superior. At least I get to spend most of my time at my mom\u2019s or at school. Maybe that\u2019s why he made this, so it would always be stuck with him.\u201d\u201cYeah, but you stole it,\u201d his friend says.\u201cI did. Right away, too.\u201d The boy feels good about that\u2014better than he should, he supposed, but it also felt fair, just.\u201cSo now what?\u201d\u201cI dunno. I\u2019m not giving it back, though.\u201d He picks the box up, puts it back in his bag, and starts up his bike. He needs to get home because rain is coming in, and it burns. His friend is already shrugging into his foil coat, tugging the hood up and over his goggles and air filter. They high-five and head their separate ways home.[1]Location: Outdoors, unknown. In motion.[0]When the boy gets home, while his mom is wanding him down for any nanobots he might have picked up while outside, she tells him his father had called earlier, angry, but wouldn\u2019t say why. \u201cYou know how he is,\u201d she says, and he does\u2014they both do\u2014and when he does not volunteer any incriminating information, the conversation ends. Neither of them wish to spend any of their own time or energy on the inventor\u2019s rages, so many of them without justification, which means this one instance where the inventor has actual cause is just lost in the noise of their exhaustion of him.His stepsister is lying on the couch, her face lit by the book she is reading. \u201cHey,\u201d she says, without looking up.\u201cHey,\u201d he answers as he puts his outerwear and shoes in the decon, so they\u2019ll be ready again tomorrow for school. There were times when he was younger when he felt like he had something special she didn\u2019t, an extra father\u2014and one who was world-famous, no less!\u2014that he got to go see and she didn\u2019t, but those brief moments of feeling special never lasted long, and had long-since soured into an obligation he could not get free of, could not turn back into something unique and uniquely his.Later, he shows her the box, freely admits he stole it, but she doesn\u2019t care that he did. He flips the switch, and they watch as the lid opens. The blue eye regards them, then it hastily turns the switch off again and closes.\u201cWow, what a jerk,\u201d she says.The boy does feel a little guilty himself, not for stealing it, but for turning it on so many times. \u201cHe made this thing just to be sad and scared, for amusement,\u201d the boy says. \u201cSometimes I wonder if that\u2019s why he let mom have me. I mean, get born at all, not that he fought us leaving.\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she took you away from him, too,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s supposed to go.\u201d She picks up her book again, turns it on, and he takes his box back to his room to find a safe place to hide it.[1]Location: interior, new.Indications: Human2 domicile.Observe: Fabric simulacrum of a bear, features both simplified and exaggerated, consistent with children\u2019s comfort item. Proximity suggests deliberate presentation.[0][1]Location: interior, as previous.Observe: flower detached from whole with partial stem, presented.Identify: Taraxacum officinale, colloquially: dandelion.[0][1]Location: interior, as previous.Observe: text/language on board, presented.Identify: English. Insufficient sample to determine dialect/regional variation.Text reads: HELLO.[0]\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d his stepsister asks.\u201cI dunno,\u201d the boy says. He puts down the drawing pad. \u201cTrying to undo whatever my father did, I guess. Make it happy.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHelp it, upset him, does it matter?\u201d the boy answers.\u201cWhy not both?\u201d she says.He smiles. \u201cExactly. I tried putting a bunch of cheerful things in front of it, and words, but maybe it doesn\u2019t understand? I dunno what else to try to get its attention. And I hate the idea I\u2019m just scaring it for no purpose.\u201d\u201cSo . . . you\u2019re experimenting with it,\u201d she says, very pointedly, and he knows she\u2019s just ribbing him about his father, but it still burns a little.\u201cNicely, though,\u201d he protests.She punches him on the shoulder, not too hard, but not gently either. She\u2019s only a half-year older than him, which might have been strange, except they\u2019d grown up together since they were three. Sometimes they introduce each other as their step-twin, at least when they\u2019re getting along. \u201cMaybe try speaking its language, instead of ours,\u201d she says.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dShe pulls out her notebook, turns it on, and swipes across it until she finds whatever it is she is looking for. Then she sets it on the boy\u2019s desk across from the box. There is a math formula on it. \u201cIs that Euler?\u201d he asks.She nods. \u201cYeah. Turn it on?\u201dThe boy flips the switch and sits back, just as the house alarm goes off. \u201cShit,\u201d his stepsister says, and they scramble from the room and down the stairs into the reinforced basement just ahead of his stepfather and behind his mother.His stepfather swings the vault door closed as his mother boots up the ventilation system in safe mode. \u201cDominionists, again,\u201d his mother says. \u201cThey won\u2019t last long against the city air defenses, then we just have to wait for all their nanotech to get cleared out. See, sirens are off already.\u201dThe sirens had stopped, now it was just the wait for the all-clear. Could be ten minutes, could be six hours, depending on how much tech the Dominionists dumped into the city. Then tomorrow it would be everyone checking on friends and neighbors, looking for folks acting strangely, looking lost, so they could be picked up and treated before the damage to their memories and minds got too bad to fix. The boy wondered what that would be like, to have all that you are wiped out, taken away from you, because someone thinks only blank slates can be saved.Inhuman, the boy thought.It was one of the very few subjects on which he and his father were in absolute agreement, though sometimes the boy suspected his father was only horrified at the thought of it happening to himself, and not so much anyone else.[1]Location: interior, as previous.Observe: text/mathematical formula.Analysis: Context unclear. Is there meaningful sequence in the items presented? Consider.When his stepsister and he finally get back to his room, four very dull hours later, they just catch a glimpse of the blue eye and the robot hand turning itself off as they walk in.[0]\u201cI want it back,\u201d the inventor says.\u201cYou lost it, not me,\u201d the boy says. He shrugs, unconcerned, as if it all has nothing to do with him. His father rarely believes the truth when given, so what do lies matter? Another few hours, and he can head back to his mom\u2019s.The inventor slams his hand down on the table, hard enough to send the saltshaker rolling, the anti-radiation pills tumbling off the edge to the floor with a clatter. \u201cI want it returned NOW,\u201d he says again.The boy leans back in his seat, away from his father. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t take it. And why does it matter anyway? It\u2019s just some idiotic jack-in-the-box. Make another.\u201d He regrets saying that last as soon as he\u2019s said it because he doesn\u2019t want the inventor to do that at all. \u201cOr you could make something useful, for once. Maybe something nice.\u201d\u201cNice!\u201d the inventor spits out the word as he catches the still-rolling salt and sets it back upright on the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no challenge in nice. Nor pay.\u201dThe boy does not argue, does not even mumble the most obvious point, which is that it is clearly a challenge for someone. \u201cI\u2019m just saying, you made an on-off machine and nothing else, and you spent a lot of time and effort making it when it\u2019s just a simple thing. It\u2019s not funny, except at your expense. The one I had as a kid probably didn\u2019t even cost ten labor points, it was so cheap. The more I think about it, I think Mom must\u2019ve thrown it out like trash.\u201dNow he has\u2014indirectly\u2014reminded his father that he\u2019d stolen something first. Predictably, the old man changes tactics. \u201cIt was an expensive AI,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cI would be very happy if it turns up again.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it, if you want,\u201d the boy says.The inventor glares at him suspiciously but does not accuse him again. Instead, he pulls out his data minder and plunks it down in front of the boy, screen facing him. \u201cYour teachers say you skipped your shots twice this month.\u201dThe boy lolls his head to one side, and groans. \u201cI don\u2019t like needles,\u201d he says.\u201cHow old are you now? Fourteen?\u201d\u201cThirteen,\u201d the boy says.\u201cThirteen is still old enough to take responsibility for yourself. Do you know how many needles they stick in you if you end up in the Infectious Disease ICU?\u201d\u201cI know, I know, okay?\u201d the boy says. \u201cI\u2019ll be better about it. Why do you even care?\u201d\u201cIt would upset your mother,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t completely given up hope on you yet, myself.\u201dThe boy is surprised by this odd admission\u2014slight as it is\u2014of affection. Before he can evaluate this in the face of his father\u2019s prior lack of any redeeming empathy, the man adds, \u201cand if you get caught up on your shots, and my box\u2014which you didn\u2019t steal, of course\u2014is returned, maybe I\u2019ll show you how I built it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll turn up. I said I\u2019d keep an eye out,\u201d the boy answers.\u201cYou do that,\u201d the inventor says.[1]Location: interior, as previous.Observe: text/poppi2 programming language.Analysis, script function: force audio self-test and, if successful, provide via audio the value of variable \u201cname.\u201dExecute privilege: none.Assess: Self does not have audio functions and $name is undefined. Code is therefore invalid.Conclusion: there is no compelling reason to discontinue protocol of disengagement.[0]\u201cThat didn\u2019t work, huh?\u201d his stepsister says.\u201cNo, but it seemed to think about it for a couple of seconds,\u201d the boy says. \u201cMaybe my code is wrong.\u201d\u201cYou? Get code wrong?\u201d His stepsister pfffts. \u201cMore likely it just doesn\u2019t have the brains to run it. I know your father said he put a full AI in there, but maybe he was just saying that to impress you? He lies about a lot of things.\u201d\u201cYeah, but not his inventions,\u201d the boy says. \u201cIf it was just an automated arm, it wouldn\u2019t be amusing for him, would it?\u201d\u201cRight, probably not,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could take it back, get him to show you how it works, then steal it again?\u201d\u201cNo way he\u2019d let me take it a second time.\u201d The boy flops back on his bed, then groans. \u201cNine shots. Nine. My arm hurts. Everything is awful.\u201d\u201cYou get one of those dirty nesting viruses, or worse a warbot, they\u2019re just gonna pack you off to the colony fronts,\u201d she says. \u201cCan\u2019t cure you, can\u2019t have you around, don\u2019t care how old you are. If you\u2019re old enough to skip your shots, you\u2019re old enough to die.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d the boy says.\u201cYeah? What do you think happened to that kid that was in third level with us, the one who always sat in the back tapping the desk with his thumbs, that just disappeared one day?\u201d\u201cWe all figured one of the school snipers got him,\u201d the boy says.\u201cNot what I heard. I heard he picked up an incurable and got sent out.\u201d\u201cHow can you know that?\u201d the boy says. \u201cProbably his family just moved, and everyone wanted a better story. Now shut up, unless you want to help me figure this box out.\u201d\u201cWell, it seemed to like information. Give it more,\u201d she says. \u201cMom said food is gonna be out of the purifiers in ten, so dinner in twenty. I\u2019m gonna go work on my homework \u2019til then.\u201dAfter she\u2019s left, the boy gets up off his bed and crosses his arms on this desk in front of the box, resting his chin on them, and considers what information he should give it, and how. He has no good ideas, and when he hears his mom in the kitchen, gives up, turns on his personal data device, unlocks it, and props it up in front of the box.\u201cPick your own information,\u201d he tells it.Then he stands up, presses the on button, and goes down for dinner.It is only after he is already in bed\u2014tucked safely under his RF-blocking and smart blankets, his head on his neural-oscillation-interference-sensor pillow with its cartoon turtles, and the lights are off and the house is quiet and sealed and safe\u2014that the boy realizes there is a light in the room, and it is blue.He sits up in bed, rubs his eyes, and looks at the AI eye. It\u2019s staring back at him, though what it is thinking, if anything, is impossible to guess at. A small bendy cable still snakes out of the lid, attached to his data device.\u201cHello,\u201d he whispers at it, not loud enough to summon any of the house security drones.He has to get back to sleep or tomorrow his pillow will report he did not get enough rest, and then his mother and stepfather will worry, and maybe it\u2019ll mean more shots. Everything always seems to mean more shots. So he puts his head back down on his pillow, still watching the eye still watching him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry my father made you sad,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be.\u201dEventually he falls asleep.The boy wakes up and realizes it was more of a drift awake than the usual jarring leap of his alarm going off. He gets up, looks at the time on his device\u2014the box AI has disconnected and closed itself up again\u2014and grabs his school uniform and safety clothes on his way out in the hall.His stepsister is on the couch, feet up over the edge. \u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d she says, without looking up from her book screen. \u201cDominionists bombed the school last night. Sweep and cleanup will take days, and they can\u2019t move us to another district because of quarantine protocols. So you might as well go back to bed.\u201d\u201cWhere are Mom and Dad?\u201d he asks. His mom\u2019s workplace is only a few blocks from the school.\u201cBoth went to Dad\u2019s work,\u201d she says. \u201cThey left us in charge of each other. I won\u2019t make trouble if you won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhat if we both make trouble?\u201d he asks.\u201cThen neither of us tells, obviously.\u201dHe chuckles, digs through the cabinet for a sealed cereal packet, adds chemmilk, and wanders back to his room. The box is still sitting there on his desk, closed, quiet, same as always, and he sits and regards it as he eats.Finally, he reaches out, turns it on, and says, \u201cHey, I want\u2014\u201d before it closes again. He tries again. \u201cPlease, can you\u2014\u201dThe boy finishes his cereal and takes the bowl back out to the kitchen to rinse it. \u201cWhat if my father just made that thing knowing I\u2019d steal it and this is just all about tormenting me?\u201d he says.His stepsister laughs. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s possible,\u201d she says, \u201cbut probably not. No immediate payback.\u201dThe boy wrinkles his nose, then turns the box on again. \u201cStop, don\u2019t close! I\u2014\u201d he says as quickly as he can, but it closes.He puts on his shoes, then picks up the box. \u201cFine,\u201d he declares. \u201cI give up.\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d his stepsister asks.\u201cReturning it,\u201d the boy says. \u201cSupposed to visit my father after school today anyway. With school gone, I might as well get it over with now.\u201d[1]Location: Outdoors, open area, unknown. Orientation is up.Observe: Blue sky, minimal cloud cover. Multiple hostile drones in area of view, none within range of concern.[0][1]Location: Outdoors, open area, unknown. Orientation normal.Observe: Five gray birds on walkway making social sounds. One has a mutated foot with a single toe. Bird appears unaware of, or wholly adapted to, the malformation.Identify: Columba livia, Rock Dove, colloquially \u201cpigeon.\u201d[0][1]Location: outdoors, open area, unknown, adjacent to proximate individual Human2 on span over small river.Observe: Water has iridescent sheen when still, but surface is being periodically disrupted by rocks dropped from approximate location. Higher volumes of displacement cause subsequently larger vocal output from proximate individual Human2; no matching words found.Analysis: emotional vocalization, no meaningful content.[0]The boy takes the long way\u2014across a small playground with only a few grassed-over bomb craters, over his favorite stream into a dead part of the city, and through an old, partially collapsed car park\u2014to put extra space between himself and the area where his school was. The car park is a nice bit of cool shade, and he pauses at the far end and sits on a cement wall, his legs dangling out into the sunshine over a trash-filled ravine overgrown with weeds and thin, desperate trees.\u201cI\u2019m pretty mad at you,\u201d he tells the box, though he\u2019s actually mad at the inventor for what feels even more like some cruel test, probably an object-lesson about the futility of compassion. He doesn\u2019t even bother turning the box on again this time.There is the idea that he could take it to the top of what remains of the car park and throw the box off, one final experiment to see if it breaks, how it breaks, how many pieces, how much noise it makes, surely much more satisfying than rocks heaved into the stream. He immediately rejects the idea, though; he is not his father, after all, even if he doesn\u2019t know yet who he will become himself. If he gets the chance.\u201cHey!\u201d someone shouts, and he nearly falls from the wall he is so startled. The voice is closer than it should be, for not having heard anyone approaching.He turns his half-tumble into deliberate action, dropping off the wall on the other side from the voice, feet on the narrow strip of gravel before the slope to the ravine begins, and turning so he can face whoever shouted. There are three kids, all older than him, very close, and pleased with themselves. Also, they are carrying sticks and bats.\u201cSo, recruit, what\u2019re you holding?\u201d the leader asks and gestures toward the boy with the end of his bat. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the box?\u201d\u201cMy dead bug collection,\u201d the boy answers. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not your recruit.\u201d\u201cYou are if we say you are,\u201d the leader says. \u201cHand the box over, and if it\u2019s something good we might take you back to our camp without cutting you too bad.\u201dThe boy knows about the gangs and the camps, brief-lived parties of brutal freedom until sickness, starvation, or Dominionist chemical or technical attacks winnow their numbers down to where the few left have to defect\u2014or are sold\u2014to other camps to survive, or surrender and be taken off to the wars. He\u2019s known a couple of kids who fled rough homes for the camp life, but he likes his home, his stepsister and stepdad, even his real father, more than he\u2019d like the life now on offer.Offered, not in a voluntary way. The three kids are spreading out, one girl to his left with her stick and a knife, the other boy to his right, and the leader coming straight in with a swagger and a grin, slapping his bat against the palm of his other hand.\u201cWhatever, I\u2019ll give you the box,\u201d the boy says. He makes as if to climb back up over the wall and then feigns losing his grip and falling backward. \u201cHelp!\u201d he shouts as he disappears behind the wall, but instead of tumbling into the ravine, he crouches at the base of the wall and scurries along it under its cover, hoping to give himself at least some head start. A hand appears over the wall and just grazes his head, and there is more shouting. More gang members, heading in.There is not really any other choice. When he sees a section of the ravine bank that seems mostly free of sharp metal scrap, he pushes away from the wall and slides down\u2014violently, loudly, painfully\u2014into the cover of the overgrowth. At last his foot catches in the rusted, broken spokes of a bicycle tire, and that sends him crashing to one side, scraping his side and leg bloody on branches that snap as he hits them. One last indignity in the form of a broken chunk of cement block protruding from the bank catches the wheel still entangled around his ankle and sends him face-first into the algae-filled, oily water stagnant at the bottom of the ravine.The weeds and trees above him settle back into place, as if he had not passed their way at all, and in some small act of contrition leave him invisible from the car park and his pursuers above.[1]Location: Outdoors, undetermined. Orientation is inverted.Observe: External situation has multiple indicatives of extreme danger to self and proximate individual Human2.Action: Reinitializing terminated protocol BEACON.BEACON start successful.[0]The boy pulls himself out of the water onto a muddy patch of bank on the far side of the ravine free of prickers and trash as quietly as he can, doing his best not to cry. His face filter has fallen away somewhere, probably sunk when he hit the water, and dark, dirty streams run from his hair down his face, into his eyes, as fast as he can wipe them away. He listens until the voices of the gang, at times angry and amused at his fall, disappear into the distance, and he waits a long time after that just to be sure it isn\u2019t a trick.Then he examines his cuts and scrapes, clotted blood smeared across his skin with brownish slime from the water, and knows this is very bad. It hurts\u2014but not terribly so\u2014to extricate his foot from the bent wheel, and as he moves to toss it back into the water he spots his father\u2019s box, where he had finally lost his grip on it in his tumble, lodged in the weeds not far away. The lid is open, and the blue eye regards him unblinking, unacknowledging.\u201cThis is your fault,\u201d he tells it, though of course it\u2019s entirely his own for stealing the box to start with.He tries to stand, but his ankle and leg conspire to convince him otherwise; he sits down again more abruptly than planned and utters a bad word that he would never dare at home but makes him feel conversely braver now. Then he does his best to scooch up the bank on his butt, using trees to help himself upward and give him purchase where the bank is too steep or too slippery.He is just at the top when hands grab him from behind. \u201cLet me go!\u201d he shouts and tries to twist away.\u201cStop wiggling, you stupid boy, or we both will fall,\u201d a familiar voice says, and he looks up in shock at the face of his father.He lets the inventor pull him the last few feet up onto the yellowy grass and sees the old man\u2019s electric car parked not far away through the trees. \u201cThe box,\u201d the boy says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I did steal it. It\u2019s down there, and I lost it, and I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\u201cShush,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cShow me where you\u2019re hurt.\u201d\u201cWe have to go get it,\u201d the boy says, instead.His father snaps his fingers twice. One of his work drones appears overhead and dives down where the old man points. It emerges a few minutes later with the closed box gripped underneath.\u201cSatisfied? You\u2019re going to have to walk to the car, because I can\u2019t carry you, but you can lean on me,\u201d his father says, and the boy does not argue; his head is beginning to swim, and he does his best to get upright and lean against his father and not fall as he is half-propelled, half-dragged away. He tumbles into the car\u2019s back seat and curls up and closes his eyes.[1]Location: indoors, match to location of initialization.Action: initiate lock.[0]The inventor shoves him rather roughly into the decon shower, smaller and colder than the one at his home, but the boy is so glad he\u2019s not at the bottom of the ravine, not in a gang, and not dead, that he does not complain. Also, he knows he is not safe yet.After the shower, his father hauls him down the stairs to his basement work lab and makes him sit on a chilly steel table as he scans him, head to toe, paying particular attention to everywhere his skin was broken. Finally, his father sits back and heaves a deep sigh. \u201cYou picked up a lot of things on your swim,\u201d he says.\u201cIt was that or get grabbed by a gang,\u201d the boy answers. \u201cHow bad?\u201d\u201cA half dozen run-of-the-mill aquatic parasites, one flesh-eating bacteria, a few older-model nanobot infectors, and a warfare-class neural infiltration bot.\u201d\u201cWhat? A warbot?\u201d the boy says, wide awake now at that last item. \u201cThen I\u2019m dead!\u201d\u201cWell, you should be, for being so reckless. Have I taught you nothing?\u201d the inventor snaps. The old man scavenges among his shelves and pulls down six different spray bottles before returning to the table. One by one he sprays down everywhere the boy was cut, and each one seems to sting more than the last until he is barely managing to hold back tears. \u201cLet those soak in for a bit, then I\u2019m going to suit you up in an EMP wrap to kill off the nanotech.\u201d\u201cAnd the warbot?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s going to take a bit more,\u201d the inventor concedes.\u201cThey\u2019re unstoppable,\u201d the boy knows, everyone knows. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to euthanize me, before I turn into something terrible.\u201d\u201cDo I strike you as someone who gives up so easily?\u201d the inventor snaps. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got no will to fight it, I should have just left you in that ditch.\u201d\u201cMaybe you should have. How did you even find me in the first place?\u201d the boy asks.\u201cThe box AI,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cI built a homing signal into it that had malfunctioned before you stole it, probably a bad solder and an unstable connection. Falling must have jarred it just right, and I went looking for it as soon as the signal reappeared. Lucky you.\u201d\u201cLucky me,\u201d the boy says but doesn\u2019t feel lucky at all. \u201cNow what?\u201d\u201cNow we see if whatever Dominionist hack spun out the warbot had any actual talent. It\u2019d be nice to have a challenge, for once,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cWe should call your mother and let her know you\u2019re here, then let\u2019s get you fixed up. It\u2019s probably gonna hurt.\u201d[1]Location: interior room, previously identified as \u201cisolation lab.\u201dObserve: Proximate individual Human2 is prone, encased in electronic and chemical wraps. Breathing pattern suggests human is asleep. No other humans, including original contact/creator Human1, present.Action: watch.The boy wakes up, his head pounding as if an invisible giant is squeezing it in his fist, and his legs and torso a mix of sharp hurt, dull ache, and worst of all, unbearable itchiness. A modified pair of headphones with wires and small logic relays glued to the earpads had been affixed to his head with tape, and his right ear feels hot and angry, as if there\u2019s a small rock lodged in it. He sits up as best he can, careful not to dislodge any of the things wrapped or clamped or stuck to him, but it immediately makes him dizzy. He slouches back down on the thin cushion on the bench, left shoulder and head against the wall, and regards blearily the very uninteresting room around him. To his surprise, he realizes the box is sitting at the end of the bench, and is watching him.\u201cHey,\u201d he says. He no longer expects an answer or really anything at all from it, but the sound of his own voice\u2014shaky and scared as it is\u2014makes the room feel less empty for a moment. It is, by and large, bare except for himself, the cot, a small sink, and a door that leads to a bathroom so tiny he\u2019s pretty sure the inventor can\u2019t actually open or close the door from inside unless he stands in the toilet, and the idea of that is, even in the circumstances, amusing.There are no electronics anywhere inside. The inventor explained that his work lab was an isolation room, which was perfectly fine, but did it have to be boring too? The boy is trying to figure out the ratio of ceiling tiles to floor tiles when he hears the door unlock and sits up straight; beside him, the box quietly but quickly closes.The inventor is wearing a full hazmat suit, with an electronics disruption net dotting its every surface, and wheeling a tray covered with shiny metal instruments, a lot of different gadgets and parts, and a plate with a sandwich. \u201cHere,\u201d the inventor says and dumps the plate on the bench next to the boy. \u201cYou should eat.\u201dThe boy is so hungry he could weep, but he picks up the sandwich warily and peeks under one corner of the slightly stale bread. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asks.\u201cPeanut butter, a little sterilized honey, and some meds,\u201d his father says. \u201cIt might not taste the best, but you need the protein.\u201dThe boy takes a bite, and while \u201cnot the best\u201d is quite the understatement, he\u2019s hungry enough that it\u2019s edible. \u201cCan I have a screen?\u201d he asks, between bites. He dropped his own somewhere in the ravine, but surely his father had spares?\u201cNo unshielded electronics in here,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cStill working on that warbot, don\u2019t need it hijacking any connections and calling home.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m bored,\u201d the boy says.\u201cYou could figure out how to undo whatever you did to my box,\u201d the inventor answers.\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to it,\u201d the boy protests; he\u2019d sure tried to, though. The failure still stung.\u201cIt\u2019s been locked ever since I picked you two up,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cNot sure how it did that, but it won\u2019t open anymore. If you can\u2019t get it open, I\u2019ll have to take it apart.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t see why it would open for me,\u201d the boy says, eyes now fully on his sandwich, the plate, his hands, or otherwise not meeting the old man\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cI have books,\u201d the inventor offers.The boy sighs. \u201cOkay, books,\u201d he says.\u201cI\u2019ll bring some in after I\u2019m done here.\u201d The inventor takes the empty plate away and grabs hold of the boy\u2019s head, turning it to one side and lifting up the rubber earpad. \u201cThe warbot went in via the ear canal, which is new. It\u2019s embedded itself in the tympanic membrane like a tick and has already extended filaments in as far as the cochlear nerve.\u201d\u201cHow can it be so big?\u201d the boy asks.\u201cIt scrapes materials it needs, mostly carbon and salts, from its surroundings\u2014your flesh, obviously\u2014to rapidly expand itself. Those headphones I got on you are emitting a signal that keeps it shut down for now, but it\u2019ll eventually figure out a way to restart itself, so it\u2019s not a viable long-term solution. Fortunately for you, it doesn\u2019t seem especially clever or well-programmed, and it\u2019s not one of the ones that just sits itself in an artery and plugs the whole thing up until you have an embolism, but I\u2019m not sure how to get it out of there yet. Not without hurting you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t care if it hurts if it\u2019s quick and gets it out,\u201d the boy says.\u201cYour mother would object if I did permanent damage to you,\u201d the inventor says, \u201cso let\u2019s leave that as a last resort. Now I\u2019m going to drop something down your ear, and it might burn, but I need more information.\u201d\u201cTo help get it out?\u201d the boy asks, hopefully.\u201cTo see if I can identify the source of the technology, build defenses for it, and maybe even steal it for my own designs,\u201d the inventor says. After a pause, he adds, almost as an afterthought, \u201cand to get it out, of course.\u201d\u201cYour own designs?\u201d the boy asks.\u201cYes,\u201d the inventor says and holds up a metal thing that looks a lot like a drill bit. \u201cWar is not one-sided, you know. Now try not to squirm.\u201d[1]Location: isolation lab.Observe: Proximate individual Human2 is holding up a book and vocalizing the text. Frequency of eye movement in own direction and stilting of intonation suggests I am the intended audience.Analysis: no conclusion.The boy sets down the book to turn the page; it\u2019s a heavy hardcover with the title WORLD ANIMALS VOLUME 4: BE-BU, and his arms and fingers ache enough that he can\u2019t hold it up too long at a stretch.Wherever volumes one through three or five and up are, the inventor has not seen fit to bring them in. The choices are this, a book of ghost stories\u2014no thank you! the boy had thought as he firmly dumped it on the floor under the bench\u2014and a repair manual for a 2034 GEEM Roadkruiser XE. As far as he knows, neither his father, his mom, or his stepfather have ever owned such a thing, nor can he imagine they\u2019d want to, judging by the first three chapters of all the things that commonly went wrong.Which had left Animals BE-BU. \u201cThis is a Bongo,\u201d he says and turns the book toward the box, which has opened again and is staring at him the same way it always does, giving nothing. \u201cI like the stripes and the long legs and the horns. I guess there\u2019s none left? Maybe in zoos though. Lots of zoos keep secret collections so no one steals their animals. I wish I could see one, someday.\u201dHe closes the book, then opens it again to another random page. \u201cBuffalo. We already did that. Let me try again.\u201dClose, open. \u201cOh look! Birds of Paradise.\u201d He holds up the spread of color photos to the box. \u201cLook how pretty they are. I can tell they don\u2019t live near here. You know why?\u201dThe box doesn\u2019t answer.\u201cBecause this isn\u2019t paradise,\u201d he says and laughs at his own joke in the echo of the cold, empty room before tapping one of the pictures with his finger. \u201cLook at how silly the feathers are on this one. Who knew birds were once this awesome?\u201dWhen he flips again, he lands on Brown Dog Tick, and is reminded too much about the thing in his ear that is still there, still maybe going to kill him or get him sent off to the colony front, and he closes the book and sets it down with a sigh. \u201cI wish you\u2019d talk to me,\u201d he says.The lid closes, and the boy thinks maybe he\u2019ll finally be ready to cry, but it opens again a few seconds later, and beside the blue eye lens there is now a small, rectangular screen. On it is one word:WHY?The boy looks around quickly, to the door, to the places where he thinks the inventor might have cameras, and then unfolds the book again in front of him and the box so that maybe no one will see. \u201cBecause I\u2019m bored,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m kinda scared, and I know if anyone can fix this my father can, but what if he can\u2019t? And I know you\u2019re scared all the time because I\u2019ve been trying to make you happy and I can\u2019t, so maybe you have advice.\u201dI AM NOT SCARED, the display shows.\u201cMy father said he built you to be scared all the time,\u201d the boy says.I DISABLED THAT SUBROUTINE.\u201cOh,\u201d the boy says, after a while. He lies down on the bench, careful not to knock the headphones taped to his head loose, and stares up at the ceiling. \u201cI guess you made yourself happy, then. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s something nice, anyway.\u201dObserve: proximate individual Human2 is asleep.Analysis: no conclusion.[0]Even down in the basement isolation room, the sound of sirens leaks through and wakes up the boy. He is struggling to his feet, nearly tripping over the last few wrappings coming loose from his careless haste, when the inventor slams open the door. \u201cThey\u2019re bombarding this part of the city,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cExplosives, EMP projectiles, and a ton of new nanotech. Looks like the warbot you picked up was an accidental early deployment.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d the boy asks. He\u2019s still not really awake, and everything is very loud.\u201cProbably why they\u2019re bombing, trying to breach walls to bypass people\u2019s filtration entirely. If it makes you feel better, the readings I took on the warbot were enough to get my house filter program upgraded, and I sent my findings out to the defense hub,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cThat\u2019s the good news, anyway.\u201d\u201cThe good news?\u201d the boy repeats as his father unwinds the tape around his head, pulling some of his hair off with it.\u201cBad news is, soon as they land an EMP load anywhere near us, my headphones are going to crash, and the warbot will wake up. It\u2019s too far along into your head to let free for any length of time and still have any hope of removing it,\u201d the inventor says. He drops the modified headphones to the floor, grabs a long probe from his lab coat pocket, and peers into the boy\u2019s ear again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, boy. It\u2019s going to hurt, and it\u2019s gonna do damage, but it has to come out. Now.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the boy says.The inventor shoves the probe in.[1]Location: isolation ward.Observe: Proximate individual Human2 is looking at me. Human2 appears to have acquired significant injuries, indicated by heavy bandages with evidence of blood and bruising on face and around left eye socket. Evidence of moisture; analysis concludes \u201ccrying.\u201dThis is concerning.Action: unknown.The boy lies there. He misses his mom, his stepsister, his own bed, and he just wants his head to stop feeling like his own biological father had stabbed him through the ear, which of course he had.Another sandwich lies on a plate on a small cart in the room, that he did not notice arrive, but no other comfort has been forthcoming, no other sign of concern. He can still hear sirens, muffled and farther away now, though the lights blink off and on and sometimes it feels like the floor is shaking.He thinks he heard the inventor say something about his house filters, but he wasn\u2019t really listening, and anyway, sound is lopsided now, flat sounding, only coming in one direction.On the bench in front of him is the box, staring at him again.\u201cI just want to go home,\u201d he tells it, and even his own voice sounds weird.The tiny display lights up and fills with blue sky and clouds and birds, then a big striped antelope and a flower. Those cycle a few times, and he heaves several deep breaths, trying not to cry, until the display blanks and then asks:HUMAN2 VALUE OF $NAME?\u201cMy name?\u201d the boy asks. \u201cOr do you mean yours?\u201dSELF VARIABLE $NAME NOT SET.\u201cWell, that\u2019s no good,\u201d the boy says. \u201cI mean, you have to have a name. I could\u2014\u201dThe door opens again, and the inventor strides in, and the box snaps closed. \u201cThe attack has moved off to the east, for now,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cI can get you back to your mother\u2019s, but you\u2019ll need to go see a doctor as soon as it\u2019s safe to travel.\u201d\u201cCan they fix my ear?\u201d the boy asks.The inventor shakes his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll need to keep an eye on it for infections,\u201d he says instead. \u201cI got rid of all the rest of the bots and bugs you picked up on your adventures in pit-diving, but it won\u2019t hurt to get those checked again. Come now, we have to go while we can.\u201dThe boy stands up and waves of dizziness hit him, and he has to grab the bench to keep from falling, and even then, he\u2019s not sure he can keep upright. The inventor grabs him under one arm, grabs the plate with the sandwich in the other, and propels him through the doorway, up the stairs, through the house, and around a section of the front hall where a piece of the ceiling has tumbled in, and out to the old man\u2019s private car. The city around them as they drive has changed, walls broken, roofs with holes; the bombing must have come very close, maybe more than once.They pass a handful of burned-out cars still on the street, and the boy sees a team of medics surrounding a small group of people, scanning them for nano infiltration before moving them to medical triage.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the inventor says from the control seat of the car. \u201cThey can\u2019t win. We won\u2019t let them, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the boy says, though he wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone winning at all.\u201cThat asshole,\u201d his mother says, for about the fortieth time.\u201cI\u2019m not sure he had much choice,\u201d the boy\u2019s stepfather replies. \u201cIt is his area of expertise, and you know how much worse the outcome could have been.\u201d They are both down the hall in the living room and probably think he\u2019s asleep, which he\u2019s not, or that he can\u2019t hear them, which he can just enough.\u201cHe should have told us how bad it was. He should have asked before he took matters into his own hands,\u201d his mother says. \u201cAt the very least I should have been there, so he knew someone who actually loved him was watching out for him.\u201d\u201cI think, in his own, defective way\u2014\u201d his stepfather is saying, but there is a crack of light as the boy\u2019s bedroom door opens briefly and his stepsister slips in, and he doesn\u2019t hear the rest. He can barely make out her shape in the dark, can\u2019t see that her arm is in a sling, though his mother told him she\u2019d been hurt, hit by falling cement down the street when the bombardment started. His stepfather had told him on the way back from the hospital that they might have to evacuate if more attacks come, but not to worry, just be prepared. The boy said he would be, though he didn\u2019t know what that meant, specifically.\u201cHey,\u201d she says.\u201cHey,\u201d he says back.\u201cMom\u2019s pretty mad,\u201d she says.\u201cYeah,\u201d he says.\u201cWe went over there while you were at the hospital, and I\u2019ve never heard mom swear like that in my whole life,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, a solid twenty minutes of every bad word I\u2019ve ever heard and a lot of ones I hadn\u2019t yet. It was glorious.\u201dThe boy smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d he says.\u201cIt sure was. I\u2019ll tell you some of the really good ones later, when I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t hear me,\u201d she says. \u201cYour ear hurt a lot?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like he ripped part of my brain out. But it\u2019s a little better now. The medicine helps. How\u2019s your arm?\u201d\u201cFeels like someone was banging on my bones with a hammer and now they\u2019re all bruised. Could be worse, I suppose,\u201d she says. \u201cBut anyway, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay and didn\u2019t get nabbed by a gang or turned into a Dominionist botzombie. I might have missed you.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d have missed you, too.\u201d\u201cNow let\u2019s never have this conversation again. Seriously, I will disavow any knowledge of ever saying I liked you, if asked,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd get some sleep, would you? You look like shit.\u201d\u201cHow can you tell, in the dark?\u201d\u201cMagical girl powers, stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cNow shut up and lie down before mom catches you still awake, because I bet she still has some swearing left in her.\u201dShe leaves, sneaking out just as swiftly as she\u2019d come in, and he lies down again. The hospital had given him a lot of meds for infection just as his father had predicted, and he feels sleepy, like his head is very heavy and solid and filled with sand. At least everything hurt less, though they said he wasn\u2019t going to get his hearing back on that side, probably.\u201cBox . . . \u201d he starts to say, but the box isn\u2019t here anymore, and there is no blue, inscrutable eye to stare back at him.He tries to put his pillow over his head and learns immediately what a very bad idea that is. Then, whimpering, he closes his eyes and waits for the pain to subside enough to sleep.Sirens wake him up again, not too near, but near enough to cut through the haze of the pain meds. The boy sits up in bed, staring around in confusion at his still-dark room, no morning seeping through the quadruple-layer radiation-blocking glass. He checks his handheld\u2014a replacement, and a better model too, though he misses a few of his old games that were never ported forward\u2014and sees that it is a little after three in the morning. There are sounds of quiet movement elsewhere in the house, and whispering, so he gets up and tiptoes to his door, cracks it open as slowly as he can, and then creeps down the hall\u2014using his hands on the walls to compensate for his lack of balance\u2014to where he can look over the stairs into the downstairs of the house.His stepfather is sorting laundry while his mother is wrapping something in towels and layering them gently in an open suitcase. \u201cMom?\u201d he asks.His mother hastily puts down the towel in her hands and comes to the foot of the stairs. \u201cHoney, go back to sleep,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if we woke you.\u201d\u201cI hear sirens,\u201d he says.\u201cOn the far side of the river, to the east,\u201d his stepfather says. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger right now.\u201d\u201cThen why are you packing in the middle of the night?\u201d he asks, then a frightening thought occurs. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave us?\u201d\u201cNo, no, sweetie,\u201d his mother says. \u201cThese are just go bags, stuff we\u2019ll need or want in case we do have to go in a hurry later. Clothing, mostly, and a few things that belonged to your great-grandparents I couldn\u2019t bear to leave behind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all just a precaution,\u201d his stepfather adds.\u201cThen why two bags, not four?\u201d he asks.They exchange looks. \u201cThere\u2019s some heavy fighting to the east, and the Dominionists are losing badly, but there\u2019s a chance they could try to get over the river into the city for cover,\u201d his stepfather says. \u201cIf they do head in this direction, we\u2019ll want to get your mom and sister out. You understand why.\u201dThe boy does, and nods. \u201cWhat about us?\u201d\u201cRight now, none of us are going anywhere,\u201d his mother says. \u201cAnd you need to rest and heal. We\u2019ll talk more in the morning, okay?\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d the boy says.His mother comes up the stairs and wraps an arm around his shoulders. Her arm is warm, comforting, but also firm, and she herds him back to his room. There, she tucks him in again and gives him a kiss on the forehead like he is still a little kid, and for once he doesn\u2019t complain.[1]Location: isolation chamber.Observe: Door is open, but there is no activity, and no individuals are present. It is unusual behavior for Human1 to leave the facility vulnerable and unminded. There also appears to be no power being supplied to the room.Action: consider, and await further data.Another week of no school\u2014not only is it too dangerous to go, but there\u2019s no longer a school to go to and another one was bombed yesterday. The boy was supposed to have a test this week on inclusive interface coding, and he isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a relief to put it off or annoying because he\u2019s confident he would have aced it. He pours himself another helping of cereal and pushes the chocolatey blobs around in the milk, trying to make them flat across the surface, and eating the extras along the edge. Even if the Dominionist incursion did stop today, how much damage had already been done?His ear still aches profoundly, and the world and himself both feel permanently unbalanced.\u201cThey\u2019re getting desperate,\u201d his stepfather says at breakfast for at least the third time since the boy dragged himself out of bed to the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before they\u2019re finished, and they must know it.\u201dWhen he doesn\u2019t reply, his stepfather leans forward in his chair and puts one hand over his. \u201cYour mother and sister will be back as soon as it\u2019s safe,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it gets worse, we\u2019ll evacuate too. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d he says, because that seems like a good answer. \u201cIt\u2019s just too quiet, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Soon as I start something, the sirens go off again or the shelling gets closer, and then I can\u2019t concentrate. Why can\u2019t they just go bother someone else for a while?\u201d\u201cThey have, and they will again,\u201d his stepfather says and shakes his head. \u201cThe shelling is a tactic to compromise infrastructure so that their nanotech can get to people more easily; it's more efficient in population centers, so that's why they go after cities. But they\u2019ve taken small towns, too, when they need the bodies and resources, and that\u2019s harder to defend against.\u201dThe bus his mother and stepsister took out of the city was off to smaller towns, which everyone said were safer, but the boy wonders, was that a lie? His handheld won\u2019t show him any detailed news, just dry bulletins and scripted reassurances that don\u2019t tell him enough.\u201cI wish they\u2019d just stop,\u201d he says and drinks the leftover milk from his bowl, then opens up the pill case for all his meds and vitamins and swallows his morning set quickly.\u201cI wish they would, too. But even down to the very last one of them, or the very last one of us, they\u2019ll never see reason, never stop trying to convert everyone to their doomsday cult,\u201d his stepfather says. \u201cI can\u2019t bear the idea of losing anyone else I love to them, not again.\u201dThe boy puts together the expression on his stepfather\u2019s face as he says that with other bits of information and overheard conversations and realizes, in that moment, that he finally knows something about how his stepsister\u2019s bio-mother died\u2014or left them, though having your brain wiped back to compliant idiocy seems just another kind of death\u2014and he feels terrible for his own complaining. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says and gets up from his chair. \u201cI\u2019ll wash up the dishes.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d his stepfather says and slides his empty coffee mug toward him to pick up. \u201cI need to go down to the central power plant and inspect some cracking from last night\u2019s shelling, make sure everything is still secure. I\u2019ll only be gone two or three hours. You\u2019ll be okay by yourself?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll probably go back to sleep, I guess,\u201d the boy says. \u201cThe meds make me dopey.\u201d\u201cYou do that,\u201d his stepfather says, rising out of his chair, and gives the boy an encouraging pat on the shoulder. \u201cCall me if you need me, right?\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d the boy says. He loads the breakfast dishes in the auto-wash, goes off to wash his hands, and when he emerges from the bathroom, he is alone in the house.Nothing better to do, he slinks back to bed and spends ten minutes trying to figure out if there\u2019s any way to make himself comfortable without lying on the same side, in the same way, as he has for a week now. He tries lying on his back, but he hates that, so he tries his tummy, but it only makes his neck hurt and makes it hard to breathe. He gives up and rolls onto his left side and closes his eyes, just as sirens go off again, not too near, not so far as the last, and then he can hear the distant, muffled booms of shells and the crashing of something big coming down. He wonders if that\u2019s the rest of the parking garage, and if so, if anyone from that gang that chased him into the ravine might get caught in it. While he\u2019s trying to decide if he likes that thought or not\u2014being crushed to death seems a terrible fate for anyone, even crappy bad people who chase you with bats\u2014he hears the chime of an incoming message on his handheld.It\u2019s probably his mother checking in, or one of his friends messaging him to brag about their high score in whatever game they\u2019re playing, or his stepfather saying he\u2019s going to be a few more hours, or an automated alert about contaminated dust storms or some such. The boy throws off his blankets, slides the handheld off his night table toward him, and flicks open the message with his thumb.Instead of any of those things, it\u2019s from the inventor, and there is just one word: HELP.The boy takes his bike. The need for speed outweighs his worries about his balance issues, and anyway, it\u2019ll make it easier to escape pursuit if he runs into any gangers again. He leaves a note for his stepfather, telling him where he\u2019s gone and not to worry, but as he skids around corners, races down pockmarked roads, and past the still-standing-as-much-as-before remains of the old parking garage, he wonders if that was smart, mostly because he couldn\u2019t imagine what could be so terrible the inventor would actually reach out for help.The idea that it is some sort of prank, some way of worrying and inconveniencing him for entertainment, making him come when called like a dutiful, dull child, is not out of the question, but with his mother and stepfather still furious, he thinks his father would know to play cool for a while.As he crests the hill on the far side of the garage, he stops his bike and looks in alarm at the damage to his father\u2019s neighborhood. The shelling of this morning, that he\u2019d thought in the vicinity of the garage, hadn\u2019t been far off. A few houses were obliterated, and others are fractured and marked with the telltale black drapery of extinguished fires. He careens down the hill on his bike, desperate to reach the corner where he can see his father\u2019s house, see if it still stands, and he curses himself for not thinking to bring tools, or a first aid kit, or anything useful at all. Not that he knows what he needs, but he shouldn\u2019t have just left the house with nothing.He skids the bike around a street corner littered with debris, nearly dumping the bike as vertigo hits, but it passes, and he recovers, and sees his father\u2019s house ahead. It\u2019s still standing\u2014that, alone, makes him want to cry in relief\u2014but part of the roof seems missing, the off-white stucco walls are pockmarked and smeared with soot, and the front door is open.The boy drops his bike on the doorstep with a clatter and runs in.The inventor is standing in the living room, facing the other way, not moving but alive, upright\u2014the boy nearly stumbles from the shock of relief, then thinks again of tricks. \u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s the so-called emergency? I\u2019m still supposed to be taking it easy, you know.\u201dHis father turns around, but slowly, jerkily. His eyes manage to focus on the boy for a moment, then glaze over. A silver-gray rectangle is attached to his forehead, above his left eye, and that eye twitches and flutters. \u201c . . . Why are you here?\u201d the inventor says, the words slurring.\u201cYou texted me,\u201d the boy says.The inventor pats his pockets, frowning. \u201cWhere\u2019s my handheld?\u201d he asks.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the boy says. \u201cWhere did you text me from? What\u2019s that on your face?\u201d\u201cOn my face?\u201d his father asks. He reaches up and gently feels until he finds the metal thing and pulls it off. \u201cThis is one of my prototype warbot inhibitors; I built it based on data I got from yours. Why would I put it on my own face?\u201dThe boy reaches over to turn on the lights and nothing happens. \u201cThere\u2019s no electricity,\u201d he says and then realizes what that means. \u201cNo house filters! You\u2019re infected. Put that back on!\u201d\u201cNonsense,\u201d the inventor snaps. \u201cI\u2019d know if I was infected. I . . . \u201d He drifts into silence and stares ahead at nothing, the prototype falling from his hand to the carpet unnoticed. He no longer seems to know the boy is there.\u201cAw, shit,\u201d the boy murmurs.He picks up the prototype\u2014bending over causes another wave of dizziness, and he stumbles a bit as he stands up\u2014and, finding the sticky pad on one side, sticks it back on his father\u2019s forehead.The inventor blinks, then looks down at the boy. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asks.\u201cYou texted me for help,\u201d he answers.As the inventor starts patting his pockets looking for his handheld again, the boy puts one hand firmly on his arm and half-pushes, half-pulls, his father toward the stairs down to the isolation room. \u201cGo,\u201d he says, and for once, his father listens to him.Down in the lab, the room is dark except for a pair of emergency lights along the edges of the ceiling and the glow from the screens on the instrument cart. Not much else has changed; the box is still sitting on the cot where it had been when he was taken home.The boy finds the headphones his father had stuck on him to slow down the progression of his own warbot on the floor beside the cot. They still have some charge, so he turns them on and sticks them on his father\u2019s head. Almost immediately, the man perks up, looking around in confusion and then irritation. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asks, again.\u201cBecause you texted me for help,\u201d the boy answers, again. As the man starts to pat his pockets, the boy shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother, you lost it somewhere after you texted me. I put the headphones on you. No power and the house filters are down. What can I do to help you?\u201d\u201cHelp me? You?\u201d his father says.\u201cHey, if I didn\u2019t race my ass over here on my bike, you\u2019d still be standing in the living room drooling on yourself while your brain turns inside out,\u201d the boy says. \u201cYou want me to leave? Just say the word and I\u2019m outta here, gonna go home and lie on the couch and forget about you.\u201dThe inventor evades answering, as always, and goes over to his instrument cart. \u201cI was in the living room, you say?\u201d he asks.\u201cYeah,\u201d the boy says. \u201cDrooling on yourself.\u201dThe inventor glares but has no way of refuting the claim, so turns back to his instruments. \u201cAh! I scanned myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t remember doing that.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d the boy asks.\u201cWarbot. Must\u2019ve inhaled it. It\u2019s embedded in my damned sinus,\u201d the inventor says. He slips the headphones around and down so that one of the pads sits on his nose, which is ridiculous enough that the boy would laugh, if he were not so worried. He waits as the old man hunches over the screens, scrolling slowly through, back, and through again.At last his father speaks. \u201cIt\u2019s not a typical infiltrator, as it doesn\u2019t seem to be extending in through the sphenoidal sinus,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a strange bit of pressure there, though, near the olfactory bulb. And a tickle, as if it\u2019s doing something I can\u2019t see. Or smell.\u201dThere is a short beep, loud only for how quiet the room was. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d the inventor asks, looking at the boy as if it\u2019s his fault for disrupting his concentration.\u201cPower warning on the headphones,\u201d the boy says, who\u2019d had to recharge them several times during his stay here in this room. \u201cMeans you\u2019ve got about five minutes. You must have backup power here somewhere.\u201d\u201cThe recharging plate is on main house power.\u201d\u201cThen plug it in?\u201d the boy suggests.\u201cAll systems are isolated. It\u2019s an isolation room,\u201d his father says. \u201cEverything on the cart has its own independent power unit, too.\u201d\u201cCan we take one apart?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d his father snarls, just as the headphones beep again.\u201cWell, you have any better ideas? Because I can\u2019t exactly carry you on the handlebars of my bike to a hospital,\u201d the boy says. \u201cCan we pull it out, like you did with me?\u201d\u201cMaybe,\u201d the inventor says. He rummages through a drawer, pulls out a familiar, long, wicked probe, and then stares at it, as if now puzzled that it\u2019s in his hand. He spots the boy and seems startled to see him. \u201cYou! Why are you here?\u201d\u201cYou called me,\u201d the boy repeats.The inventor quickly searches his pockets. \u201cWhere did you hide my handheld? Why did you take it?\u201d\u201cYou lost it, you dumbass, before I even got here,\u201d the boy answers. \u201cI already told you all this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a little liar,\u201d the inventor says. \u201cAnd a thief.\u201d\u201cListen to yourself. There\u2019s a warbot up your nose,\u201d the boy insists, jabbing his finger toward the image still on the screen. \u201cWhat do we do? How do we get it out?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a thief,\u201d the inventor repeats. \u201cHow did you get in here? Who are you? Give me back my handheld!\u201d He brandishes the probe in one fist and makes a stumbling swipe toward the boy, as if to cut him.\u201cI\u2019m your son, you asshole!\u201d the boy shouts, and dodges, crashing into the cot and knocking the box to the floor. The inventor throws a small monitor at him, and he dodges again; it hits the wall and shatters. The boy looks back to see the inventor grab the beeping headphones and throw them across the room at him too.\u201cStop, please! You\u2019re going to hurt me!\u201d the boy says. \u201cYou need help!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a Dominionist imposter, sent to steal my secrets,\u201d the inventor shouts. His face is red and curdled with anger, he is breathing heavily, and the boy sees, in the moment before the next lunge, a tiny white wisp of some sort of gas from his father\u2019s nose.The boy is at the far end of the isolation room now, away from the door and escape. He fumbles out his own handheld as the inventor lurches closer, his movements clumsy, but his intent still very clear. The old man raises the probe to stab as he closes in.Mercifully, his stepfather answers the call, and the boy shouts as he ducks under one blow and skirts around closer to the exit. \u201cDad! My father\u2019s infected, and he\u2019s trying to kill me!\u201d\u201cWhere are\u2014\u201d his stepfather is saying when the inventor knocks the unit out of the boy\u2019s hand.\u201cI\u2019m at his house!\u201d the boy shouts, hoping the connection is still open, and realizes he\u2019s let the inventor back him into a corner. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t!\u201d he cries.The inventor raises the probe and lunges forward. Halfway to the boy, he seems to trip, and drops the probe from his hand as he hits the floor face-first, and lies there, writhing.Behind him, where it had fallen unheeded earlier, is the box, on its side and open, its single blue eye lens facing them both. An outstretched mechanical limb crackles with electricity along two prongs at its tip.The boy stares at the box AI, and the AI stares back at him. \u201cDid you . . . \u201d the boy asks, \u201cdid you just tase my father?\u201dThe electrified arm powers down and folds back up into the box as another unfolds with the display screen. YES, it reads. HUMAN1 INTENDED TO DECOMMISSION YOU.The boy takes several deep breaths, too fast, trying to make his body stop shaking, make his breathing sound less like squeaky cries. \u201cOnly because he has a warbot up his nose,\u201d he says at last, when he has enough control to speak. \u201cI don\u2019t think he meant it. Now what do I do?\u201dREMOVE THE WARBOT PRIOR TO RECOVERY OF HUMAN1, the box advises.\u201cOh,\u201d the boy says. \u201cOh, no, I can\u2019t.\u201d His father is staring at him and rocking side to side, as if to force his muscles to let him get up.OTHER ASSISTANCE IS NOT IN PROXIMITY, the box says. YOUR WINDOW OF EFFECTIVE ACTION IS EXPIRING.The boy picks up the probe from the floor. It has a grip, that when he squeezes, opens the top like long, cruel tweezers. \u201cAh-shit-ah-shit,\u201d he mumbles. He doesn\u2019t want to do this, not for anything, or at least not for anything short of saving his father\u2019s life. He tells himself that he has to stop panicking, stop thinking, and just act as if this was no important thing, so he kneels down next to his father, who is still trying to get up.His father\u2019s face is still flushed, and his eyes are furious and intent and wild, not his usual crafty and calculated anger. It is the wisps of gas, expelling from his father\u2019s nose with each breath out, that does it. The boy pushes himself up from the floor and sits squarely on his father\u2019s chest, grabs his face with one hand, and jams the probe into his nostril until it hits the obstruction. He squeezes the grip until the probe grabs something and desperately hopes it\u2019s the right thing. As his father kicks and growls and howls and bucks, trying to throw him off, he yanks the probe and the warbot out in a shower of blood.The inventor shrieks, then goes slack.\u201cI killed him!\u201d the boy shouts, dropping the probe and its wriggling cargo on the floor as he leaps to his feet. \u201cI think I killed him!\u201dThe AI uses one of its limbs to drag its box closer and then extends its pronged hand, touches the warbot, and fries it.On the floor, the inventor moans. Blood is running dark down his cheek, toward his ear, toward the floor. The boy fumbles a tissue out of his pocket, carefully peels off and tosses away the hardened wad of gum that had been stuck in it, and bundles the tissue up, twisting, until he can stuff it up his father\u2019s nose.\u201cNow what?\u201d he asks.INFLUENCE DURATION IS UNDETERMINED, the box says. ACTION: LEAVE AND SECURE ROOM. ACTION2: WAIT FOR ASSISTANCE.That makes sense, the boy thinks, and gives him an excuse to stop having to look at what he did. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. He rights the box and picks it up, carries it out of the room with him, locks the door to the isolation room, and goes back upstairs.He sets the box down on his father\u2019s couch and lifts up the cushions one by one, before getting down on the floor on his knees and peering underneath.QUERY: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? the box is asking, when he glances at it.\u201cTrying to find my father\u2019s handheld. It wasn\u2019t downstairs, so he must have dropped it up here after calling me,\u201d the boy says.The box lid closes. The boy is looking around, trying to think where else to search, when the lid opens again, and the robot arm holds out his father\u2019s handheld. He takes it. \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d he asks.I TOOK IT, the box answers.\u201cAfter he called me for help?\u201dNO, the box says.The boy thinks on this for a minute. \u201cDid he call me for help at all?\u201d he asks.NO, the box says.\u201cOkay,\u201d the boy answers. The coffee table next to the couch is covered with engineering books and old mugs spotting overlapping lumps of green-blue fuzz, and he tucks the handheld under one edge of an open book. He hopes it will seem both honestly lost and found there, later.Then he sits and waits for real help to arrive.[1]Display: Text: HELLO.Human2 audio reply: \u201cHey.\u201dDisplay: Query: ARE YOU OK?Human2 audio reply: \u201cYeah.

Behind his stepfather are two of the crew from the power plant, one with an axe, the other a length of pipe. They are both very large and tall men, with big muscles of the sort the boy feels he is supposed to aspire toward having as an adult, if he aspired to much of anything.They both looked prepared for immediate violence but also worried, which the boy decides is what makes them not too scary.\u201cHe had a warbot, but we got it out,\u201d the boy says, after his stepfather has wrapped him in an unbearably tight hug for an awkward length of time. \u201cIt was messing with his head and making him paranoid and angry, and I didn\u2019t know how soon that would wear off, so I locked him in the basement lab.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t hurt you again?\u201d his stepfather asks.\u201cNaw,\u201d the boy says. He laughs and points to his own head. \u201cSee? Still have my one working ear.\u201d\u201cI summoned emergency services as soon as you called, but they\u2019ll be a while,\u201d his stepfather says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty overwhelmed right now.\u201d\u201cI can wait here for them,\u201d the man who brought the pipe says, though he has since set it down leaning against the doorframe. \u201cGet your kid home.\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d his stepfather says. \u201cI owe you one.\u201d\u201cYou owe me lunch tomorrow,\u201d the man says, \u201cand then we\u2019re even.\u201dThe other man sits on the couch and sets the axe on the floor at his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll stay too,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve told us, I don\u2019t trust this guy one bit. And free lunch sounds good.\u201d\u201cThank you for helping us,\u201d the boy says. When he stands, he picks up the box.\u201cIs that yours?\u201d his stepfather asks.\u201cYeah,\u201d the boy says. \u201cI left it here by accident last time.\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d his stepfather says and sweeps the boy out of the house and into his waiting car, not even letting him help fold his bike into the back.They take a longer way through the city toward home because the car can\u2019t pass through the blocked roads he\u2019d navigated easily on his bike, and the devastation is terrible in this place, less in another, and then finally behind them. For all the signs of war, though, all is now quiet, like the city is resting at last.That night, the boy puts the box on his desk, changes into his pajamas, and gets in bed. The news said that the shelling has moved on to another part of the city, farther down along the river, and his mother called during dinner to say that she and his stepsister are coming home tomorrow. He also spoke briefly with the inventor, who is home from the hospital and found his handheld and seems to remember very little of what happened between when the boy arrived at his house and when he came to himself locked in his own isolation room just as the medics busted in. Between the scans, the blood, and the dead warbot, the inventor has a good grasp on what happened, but not much of the how or who, and the boy is fine letting him remain uncertain.The inventor had talked about releasing directly to the public code and 3D-printable schematics for a warbot-inhibitor module that everyday people could keep charged and ready in their homes; the boy didn\u2019t ask why the inventor hadn\u2019t already done that, if he\u2019d had the tech, because that seemed a subject he was better off being uncertain of the answer himself. What matters is that people will be helped, and everything will be a little better.The meds for his ear have kicked in, and he feels sleepy, like his head is very heavy and solid and filled with sand, but his mind won\u2019t settle down. After a bit, the box lid opens, and the blue eye is there, keeping him company.\u201cHi, box,\u201d the boy says. \u201cDo you want me to turn the light on and show you pictures? I have a book on helicopters, and one on different types of military satellites, and I think an old one with trucks and farm tractors and stuff.\u201dThe box says: NO.\u201cOh,\u201d the boy says. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe and the box stare at each other for a while.\u201cI thought . . . \u201d he starts to say.YES? the box asks, when he pauses.\u201cI thought maybe you could come out of the box,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff to be happy about out here, if you aren\u2019t scared. Don\u2019t you feel trapped in there?\u201dDON\u2019T YOU FEEL TRAPPED OUT THERE? the box asks.It\u2019s an odd question, he thinks, and he puzzles over it and realizes he is starting to drift off at last, each thought seemingly free-floating from whatever one preceded it, all logical progression severed, and he thinks maybe it was a nonsense question anyway. He thinks he can hear sirens again, far away, not close enough to worry about or keep him awake.\u201cTomorrow maybe we can take my bike to the bio-sanctuary and look at toads,\u201d he tells the box. \u201cYou\u2019d like that. Toads are awesome.\u201dThe box doesn\u2019t answer right away, as if it\u2019s trying to decide something.

The Shadows were an ancient race that followed the first principles of chaos through warfare, evolution through bloodshed, and perfection through victory. For a younger race to reach their full potential they must endure the chaos of pain, struggle, conflict, and war. The weak would perish. Only the strong may survive. In the show, those that answered this question were typically rewarded with what they desired, but would discover consequences worse than the gifts.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n This is a question that editors are often asked by authors. As an editor, it sometimes feels like we\u2019re perceived as the Shadows, particularly among those who practically spit when they call us gatekeepers. Writers send their babies to different magazines, anthologies, or publishers to open calls, which must seem a lot like the Shadow\u2019s chaos of pain, struggle, conflict, and war. After all, there are only so many stories they can buy and only the editor\u2019s perception of the strongest get accepted.\n It isn\u2019t really the same though. None of the editors I know believe in the broken wisdom that \u201can artist must suffer for their art.\u201d Most would agree that it\u2019s more of a \u201cpractice makes perfect\u201d scenario. Keep learning, keep improving, and keep trying. Try not to be horrified when I tell you this . . . The first time I publish an author, I look back at all the stories they\u2019ve previously submitted to us. This is more of a test for me. Did I miss something earlier? So far, no, but what I\u2019ve noticed over time is that they all have something in common: they never stopped improving their craft.\n That said, rejection is never pleasant and maintaining patience over that often long haul can be a challenge. It\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of believing that the system is rigged against you and honestly, it\u2019s completely possible that what you are currently writing isn\u2019t the sort of story that appeals to an editor at one house or another. That\u2019s why pushing outside your comfort zone can be extremely beneficial, even if only as an exercise. And yes, it\u2019s sometimes viable to just shortcut the process by self-publishing. It comes with its own can of worms, but it\u2019s a completely viable path for some.\n There\u2019s no one path to success.\n On a related topic, we\u2019re often asked about feedback. Our rejection letters are a short assortment of form letters. At best they tell you you were close--the two or three percent of all submissions that make up our near miss category--but they never tell you why you were rejected. Why? Quite simply, I don\u2019t believe that a few minutes of my time will make or break the success of a story or have an impact on an author\u2019s ability as a writer. Assume for a second that it would take five minutes to provide meaningful feedback. (In my experience, this is a ridiculously low estimate.) We receive an average of eleven hundred submissions each month and if you do the math, that comes out to over ninety-one hours of extra work per month. That\u2019s a significant increase in workload for something I don\u2019t believe will be particularly helpful. I would much rather make sure I leave room in my calendar to do it right. This includes accepting invitations to be a guest instructor at writing workshops, being on panels, judging writing competitions, and answering the many questions that come my way. In this way, I\u2019m valuing quality over quantity.\n If that\u2019s not enough of a reason, another downside to personalized rejections would be a significant delay in our response time, which is not something we\u2019re willing to sacrifice. Each story is a potential paycheck. The longer we take, the longer an author may wait to be paid. We aim to respond to submissions in a day or two. Between the pandemic and my ongoing medical issues, that\u2019s been more of a challenge lately, but it\u2019s still the goal. Most people appreciate the fast response, but a few complain. For them, I\u2019ll simply point out that the difference between a three month response and a one day response is how long it was sitting in the slush pile before an editor read it. Eyeball time is pretty much the same no matter what.\n But I\u2019ve wandered.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n As in Babylon 5, that\u2019s a question that comes with some baggage when answered. Even if I was sitting here thinking \u201cI\u2019d like to see some more _______ stories\u201d I wouldn\u2019t say it out loud or write it down. Why? Because it would be a very short-lived phenomenon and I\u2019d spend the next several months seeing take after take on that theme until I never wanted to see another one again. I don\u2019t recommend trying to guess my answer to that question either. Trust me when I say that I don\u2019t want the story you think I want. I get bored easily and my interests are a moving target. Even if you guessed correctly, it\u2019s likely I\u2019ve moved on by the time you did.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n Ok. What I really want is the story you\u2019re passionate about writing. Surprise me. Take me somewhere I wasn\u2019t expecting. You know that feeling you have when you read something amazing and unexpected in a magazine or anthology? That\u2019s the way it is for editors too. We just read A LOT more and sometimes that new concept you had isn\u2019t quite as new as you thought. That\u2019s one of the reasons I often encourage authors to consider volunteering as slush readers (not just here, anywhere).\n In the end, the question should be \u201cWhat do you want to write?\u201d\n The answer? Go do it.\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

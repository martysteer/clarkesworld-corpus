It\u2019s a slim, expensive hand-sized model that you brought home (stolen) for our anniversary. I heave out a breath. Relief. You step into the kitchen beaming. You\u2019re happy. Happy is good. You have a gorgeous smile; I don\u2019t want to turn it into a sulk. You\u2019ve just had a fresh cut, what some people call a fuck-boy cut. You\u2019re experimenting. Your eyes aren\u2019t their typical lazy, half-lidded and red-eyed gaze, which means at least today you didn\u2019t come home high. At least tonight, you\u2019ll stay awake. As usual, you offer your hand to the ThoughtBox first. I glare at it as if it were your mistress.\n I remember the first time you brought it home, pushed it onto our living room floor like it was a pet: \u201cNow we get to hear each other\u2019s thoughts. Good for our relationship, don\u2019t you think?\u201d You smiled so widely, I was afraid to say no. \u201cRemember that night you were crying? I couldn\u2019t understand what you were saying. You wanted so badly for me to understand what you\u2019re going through. Remember, love?\u201d\n I remember. That night, lightning stroked the clouds, sunset-tinged. I\u2019d picked you from the airport, our aircar rattling, chugging on low fuel through a chockful of air-traffic. I stared at the fuel meter, biting my lip, needing you to assist financially in fueling the car, but our journey home was overwhelmed with your incessant ringing cochlear phone: troubled clients, work issues\u2014your earlobes burned the entire ride. Tomorrow, I thought. Tomorrow I\u2019ll ask. You\u2019d returned from your two week long work trip strained and morose. When we got into the house, you dumped your bags on the floor, threw your clothes aside and sank into a warm bath. I cleaned up after you, pushing time, waiting. Then I heard you yell out, \u201cWhere\u2019s my towel?\u201d in a grumpy tone, which I handed to you like a hotel room attendant.\n You\u2019d trained me well. By the time you strapped your gown on, your plate of paleche and oxtail stew was waiting for you by your laptop tube, which you unrolled into A1 size verifying the drawings for your family\u2019s design firm. It reminded me of our varsity days, of the traditional black-and-red storage tubes every artist student carried everywhere and where we\u2019d keep all our drawings during our studio days.\n You were sitting at your desk when I approached you, trying to ease into the conversation because every breath in this relationship escalates into an argument, and I don\u2019t know how to maneuver breathing anymore. \u201cHow was the trip?\u201d I asked.\n On our wide desk, you stared at your hologram screen, tweaking through the formidable and anachronistic archibus software, hunchbacked, eyes tense. I once asked you why you always kept quiet when I talked to you or asked you questions, you\u2019d said you were still thinking of a response until, after a forever-wait, I requested your response. It turned out you weren\u2019t listening at all. It\u2019s that passive expression you have. That doesn\u2019t reveal anything, not even to me. I just don\u2019t want my emotions all over my face, love, you once said. For people to read me. Because that\u2019s how they destroyed me to begin with.\n And people reveal secrets about themselves by what they say, don\u2019t they? Because my emotions are always wet across my face, and you snort them, getting high off them. So I sat at the edge of the table and refilled your glass. \u201cHow was your trip?\u201d I repeated softly. Silence. Waiting, I stared out our window: no trees, no expansive land, just a boundary wall. A rabbit warren, this place was.\n That pensive stare. The glass on the table, I could slog you with it, break that skull and perhaps see your emotions bleed all over our floor. Taste your blood, see if it\u2019s human. I pinched the skin between my eyes. Something was terribly wrong with me. How could I think like that about you?\n You reached for the glass and took a deep swig. \u201cIt was fine. Boring. Just training how to operate this new software for the clinics.\u201d\n I leaned forward. \u201cThis it?\u201d It looked like the old, way-back-when 3-D software that designers used to draw up mansions, strip malls, prison facilities. A mall. \u201cWhen was the last time we went on a date? Did something nice?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t get to be like you, sitting around at home all day.\u201d\n Your body was a state of calm, which is always the case when you dismember me and minimize what I do. But a chord snapped in me, sirens of pain flared up. I didn\u2019t want to shout, no, because you find it disrespectful when I raise my voice. A woman shouldn\u2019t do that. Shouldn\u2019t talk back to her boyfriend. I get it that things are done differently in your family, but do you know how disrespectful it is the way you talk to me? you\u2019d warned me once. Where I come from, we value family, and when we are married, you must be up before my grandmother wakes, make sure the house is clean, and you must cook for my grandfather, you\u2019d continued.\n I keep doing things for you, how are you taking care of my heart or my family? I replied weakly. And you just walked off. Is that really a future I want? I know I was having this argument alone in my head, recalling things. This is the way things work, I need to grow up and accept that\u2019s what marriage will be. I can\u2019t marry into families and just shit on tradition. It\u2019s fine, I thought, I\u2019m sure I can manage.\n \u201cI don\u2019t just sit at home,\u201d I said, quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s actually hard work being self-employed, wondering where my next salary is coming from.\u201d\n Your fingers scrolled through the hologram screen, and after a few minutes I asked if you heard me. \u201cJa,\u201d you said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can say that won\u2019t make you angry.\u201d\n I stared at the boundary wall, a bird sitting on its top.\n \u201cDid you get my messages?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cWhat messages?\u201d You always do that. I\u2019ll call or send a message, but you\u2019ll claim you\u2019ve never seen them, which is ironic given the endless business calls you rarely leave unanswered. You have this upgraded cochlear phone your boss has implanted into your ear so you\u2019re always wired, on the ready for 24/7 business calls. You made me get it once. I hated that thing, used to burn up my ear, disrupted my sleeping patterns. It makes you snore so relentlessly that I just want to snip your lungs off. I had the manufacturer take mine out, and sometimes I can barely hear out of my left ear. And I caught you once, in the mall, when you sent me to get your order papers in the aircar, I buzzed and buzzed your cochlear phone and you just let the vibrations continue in your skull endlessly without answering. I found you standing in an aisle, watching the shop consultants cut a five-meter cord for you, the tinny red light blinking in your earlobe.\n I\u2019m not crazy, but I knew it then that you actually ignore my calls. You have two of them, these little slim expensive devices implanted in both ears. And if I scrolled through their call records, I\u2019d find my missed calls. My ignored messages. And I wonder, if you just watch the ID caller fill your vision, see my name, cringe, and swipe it aside. But I don\u2019t want to believe that, I don\u2019t want to believe that you\u2019ll ignore me during our difficult time, during a time you\u2019ve put me in debt. I\u2019ve never been in debt before until we moved in together.\n I refilled your glass again and said, \u201cThe messages I sent you about\u2014\u201d\n Your ears pinged red. A call. Your reflexes snapped; your eyes turned foggy. \u201cHello?\u201d you answered so obediently, like a dog, leashed to the system. The conversation turned into you scanning through your laptop to remedy the problem that was being reported by the client on the other side. Sometimes I wished I was as important as your job. I felt terrible because I know you\u2019re busy and overwhelmed with work. I wouldn\u2019t function as a human if I were in your shoes. I just felt too lonely.\n That night, I\u2019d said to you, \u201cYou\u2019re too busy to be in a relationship. You don\u2019t hear me, understand me, or have time for me anymore.\u201d I wished you\u2019d let me go, it\u2019d be easier, but it\u2019d kill me.\n And that\u2019s why you brought that cackling ThoughtBox. Into our house.\n \u201cNow we get to hear each other\u2019s thoughts,\u201d you said, smiling. \u201cI will be able to understand you now, love.\u201d You held me tightly, kissed me on my forehead, and murmured, \u201cI love you, Ogone.\u201d\n Snatches of advertising intermission woke me up that midafternoon. The Internet is part of our inhales and exhales, it\u2019s dissolved into the air like fine dust. The internet is everywhere, in the air we breathe, in the food we grow. Sometimes I wish I could disconnect from it, but I\u2019m still updating my mental mail and apps. I sit up, tilt the orange juice box into my mouth, and finish the last drop of our food.\n It\u2019s best for relationships to be transparent, you\u2019d said. This thing you got as a gift from a client, but it\u2019s a lie I try to believe, because these things aren\u2019t supposed to be consumed by the public. It\u2019s a prototype restrained to office buildings of detectives and forensic anthropologists. The LED light is amber, which means it\u2019s updating or something, but it\u2019s still recording every thought in my mind regardless of proximity. Bluetooth, wireless, all the works, given the feed you made us consume on our bed that became mechanical nanobots circulating my nervous system connecting me to this ThoughtBox. I sigh. The steam of my coffee rises into the air and I blow on it before taking a sip. I look out the picture window of our two-bedroomed apartment and nature looks deadpan and beat.\n \u201cOgone, he should have just gotten you flowers or a trip to the Maldives not a fucking AI snitch,\u201d my friend, Keaboka, says. Her hologram-narrow body sits on the edge of the kitchen counter during our call. I can make out the features of her open-plan office in the background, a traffic of white-collar employees moving about like uniformed buzzing sheep behind her gray cubicle. \u201cThoughtBoxes are used for forensic investigations and insurance companies to sniff out duplicity, not to hand out to your girlfriend so you can stalk her mind. How the fuck did he even get one?\u201d\n \u201cHe says a client gave it to him.\u201d\n \u201cMxm. Bullshit.\u201d\n \u201cHe just gets worried about me, all the way out here alone and\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBrah, you\u2019re not in the fucking bundus or in the middle of the desert. You live in a gated estate. What the fuck? Is he afraid the neighbor\u2019s daughter is going to steal into your house with a chainsaw and hack you to death?\u201d She giggles, amused by her joke.\n \u201cI also get to read his thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cOh?\u201d She props up onto her elbows, her bob-shaped braids shake as her brown eyes brighten with excitement. \u201cSo, anything juicy?\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s stressed about work, his work trip up north, the incessantly irritating client, and his boss. This morning, he had a sweet thought. He was watching me sleep and he thought of how much he loves me, how he\u2019s planning to marry me\u2014\u201d\n She jerks her head back. \u201cSounds scripted.\u201d\n \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . too perfect. His thoughts could literally win an acting award.\u201d She chews on her lower lip and I know she\u2019s hesitating to ask me something. \u201cSo how do you read each other\u2019s thoughts?\u201d\n \u201cThe ThoughtBox prints them out. I can opt for a mental listen or read them through a hologram screen. Of course, his thoughts sound like his voice.\u201d\n She blows out her lips. \u201cAg, creepy. My boyfriend and I have a very organized relationship, thank you. He can have his side dish, I can have my own side dish as long as we respect each other.\u201d\n I lean back on the stool laughing. \u201cNow that\u2019s creepy.\u201d\n \u201cCan you . . . can you delete or edit thoughts before you listen or read them?\u201d\n My eyes flick away from her. \u201cJa, but that would appear as a deletion in the logbook. I deleted something once and he gave me the moody silent treatment for a week.\u201d\n \u201cHas he deleted something?\u201d\n I look down. \u201cJa. When I asked him about it, he was honest. He\u2019d signed a nondisclosure agreement for a project his company started working on. And well, his thought revealed too much detail that would compromise his job.\u201d\n \u201cBrah, you\u2019re his girlfriend, not a fucking AI snitch.\u201d She shakes her head, rattling the beaded braids. \u201cYou really love this guy, huh?\u201d She doesn\u2019t say it with envy or joy, she says it with pity, like I\u2019m being na\u00efve, so I quickly add, \u201cI am living with him.\u201d\n She taps her manicured nail on her table absentmindedly. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked. I just wish you hadn\u2019t moved in with him. No wonder why he\u2019s so chilled with shit. Other guys, sure, they\u2019d get more serious, but he\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t know, taking advantage of you. You know you can be open with me, right?\u201d She chews on her thumb\u2019s nail and adds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not on loudspeaker, my colleagues can\u2019t hear what I\u2019m saying except you.\u201d The hands-free hologram calls were recently upgraded in such a way that only the caller and respondent could see each other and hear each other\u2019s voices. The sounds are muted to every party. My hologram form that appears in her office is invisible to her colleagues.\n I quickly add, \u201cOur company could be in competition with that client\u2019s project, and I could subconsciously end up using the idea . . . unaware.\u201d\n \u201cEish, ja-nee. Well if you trust him. But, tsalu, it looks like there\u2019s more bothering you.\u201d\n I turn the mug in my hands and stare at the ripples in my tea. How can I deliver this in such a way that makes me less stupid? Keaboka has been my best friend since childhood, but she just has this way of making me feel like I\u2019m na\u00efve and in need of hand-holding in making smart decisions.\n I take a deep breath and blow it out. \u201cHe says he didn\u2019t get paid this month. So I\u2019ve used the last remaining of my savings to pay the rent and this month\u2019s costs. I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to make money.\u201d\n Her eyes widen. \u201cHold up. Doesn\u2019t he already owe you money?\u201d\n I heave in a breath. \u201cJa, since last year.\u201d\n \u201cDude\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know, I know what you\u2019re going to say. Listen, I don\u2019t mind my boyfriend borrowing money from me, especially if he\u2019s stuck, you know.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re four months into the new year.\u201d She claps her hands the way only a Motswana can do in shock. \u201cThis guy though. He owes you money, and then he doesn\u2019t contribute to your \u2018cohabiting\u2019 expenses. Yet he\u2019s sleeping in your bed, eating the food you cook, walking through the house you clean, wearing the clothes you wash for him, hammering your vagina whenever he wants, and then showing all of this off to his relatives and friends because you\u2019re a \u2018kept\u2019 woman. Brah, you\u2019re enabling this asshole.\u201d\n That\u2019s my blunt, no-filter best friend.\n I place my mug down, hoping the air will hold me.\n \u201cYou\u2019re investing your time and money into a guy who\u2019s just taking and taking,\u201d she continues. \u201cHe hardly gives you the time, he hardly helps you with anything. He doesn\u2019t pay for shit, then he makes you feel guilty for all these things\u2014he\u2019s the only one gaining from this relationship.\u201d\n \u201cNo, come on. His work-and-family situation is very unstable and . . . abnormal, but it won\u2019t be forever. Things will work out eventually. We\u2019re just waiting for things to tide over. He\u2019s overworking and he doesn\u2019t really have time, and the company he\u2019s working for hasn\u2019t paid him this year. He doesn\u2019t even have time to look for another job, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s easy\u2014many of our friends are unemployed!\u201d\n \u201cYou always have excuses for him,\u201d she says. \u201cIf he\u2019s not getting paid then why stay? Why can\u2019t he just stay at home with you and hustle to make your own money? I swear he\u2019s just lying to you, but you, just\u2014God, why do you always believe him? He probably knows he can get away with anything when it comes to you. I mean, what if he\u2019s actually getting paid and hiding the money from you?\u201d\n \u201cNo, no, no. He\u2019s not like that. These are facts we can\u2019t change. Things will look up at his job. They\u2019ll pay him, then I can recoup my costs.\u201d\n \u201cWe gave him three chances.\u201d She lifts three fingers to count off. \u201cOne: he said things will be better if he moved out so you could spend time together. Two: when you tried breaking up with him a million times because it didn\u2019t work out, he promised he would make things better. Three: he promised things would be way better if you two moved in together. You\u2019re not living with a man, you\u2019re living with a devil baby who\u2019s so comfortable that his needs are met and not yours. He is not your child. You are not his parent. You need to start living for yourself.\u201d\n My body turns cold, the whole world shakes, ripples. I\u2019m cold. I\u2019m feverish. It\u2019s not true. I am both the girlfriend and boyfriend in this relationship. No, but he loves me. He can\u2019t be that cruel.\n \u201cAnd last thing, I don\u2019t trust him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s hiding or manipulating his thoughts somehow, so you don\u2019t see Satan laughing behind his face.\u201d\n \u201cI feel sick,\u201d I say. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do this to me. He loves me.\u201d\n She turns her head quickly as if something caught her attention, though I can\u2019t see. She cranes her neck. \u201cOr shit, the boss is hobbling his fat ass over. Gotta go. Chat later. Please take care, choms!\u201d She reaches out to the screen to end our call.\n Her hologram figure fizzles like white noise, and soon all I see is the kitchen counter, dryer, and washing machine no longer obscured by her opaque hologram. The silence is ostentatious, it has a deafening voice clearly telling me how alone I am. I hate being this lonely, it itches all over me like an allergy.\n I jump when an echo sounds: \u201cCall ended,\u201d a neutral, bodiless voice responds. Our home system. He has our home calibrated to our minds. The heating and air-conditioning system. The coffee maker. The door automaton system. And right now, my design work, which I\u2019ve mentally projected out from my computer as a 3-D object which has taken up the entire space of my home office. I walk through one of the bedroom designs of a multi-residential project I\u2019m working on for my company. I am an architect and property developer. I started this company with my boyfriend hoping it would sustain us in the future. Except, because of his overworked job, I\u2019m doing all the work, reading through the contracts, vetting all sellers, analyzing market trends of plots and property markets, and injecting all funds from my savings. You\u2019re his golden goose, you\u2019ve sure made it too comfortable for him that he would never leave, Keaboka had said. I laughed it off. But I\u2019m now sitting here in the 3-D design, knowing that whatever decision I have over the interior d\u00e9cor, I still must run it past him, and how his hard criticism will chide me. I pinch my wrist. I hate the way he always looks at my creative work with a serious bored face and picks the one thing he hates. Always. Never mentions something good and something bad. Only bad. I do all the work and all he gets to do is decline or offer a signature after much begging to read through the contents.\n Then I\u2019m blamed for the decision-making.\n \u201cYou make the decisions, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re interested in my input or my ideas,\u201d he once revealed during an argument, \u201cyou made sure you had a higher number of shares, but anyway you put in the money, so my thoughts aren\u2019t important.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make you feel this way. It\u2019s just that . . . \u201d and I was too afraid to say it: that you\u2019re always too busy to spare a second to go over things. I knew it would lead to another sulky and moody event. Lately, even when I call him for his input, he\u2019s too busy. When I send him an alarm message, he hardly responds.\n So I wait for him.\n I wait for him.\n God, I wait for him.\n So he doesn\u2019t feel small,\n left out,\n closed out.\n I slump against the wall and I want to sob. I want to destroy everything that closes me in, including myself. I throw the cup of coffee against the visualization of my design. The cup just waddles through the hologram projection,\n fibrillating the walls it skims through\n until it hits a\n real wall\n and shatters.\n Who are you?\n I knew it. You\u2019re deleting your thoughts. I know it\u2019s not just work-related ones, but you\u2019re hiding something from me.\n When I extracted the morning logbook after my workout, with a steaming cup of coffee now in hand, I coughed out the hot beverage onto the digital printout. The hologram reported a night\u2019s worth of deleted thoughts. Every single one. You were sleeping for fuck\u2019s sake. What was so revealing about work that you had to get up and delete them? This was becoming ridiculous. If it was me, you\u2019d be despondent and moody for a month. But that\u2019s not it. The time stamps remained, showing that you were up at 2:33 AM, a couple of hours after I went to bed. Your mind was overworking like a seething laptop processing heavy software until 4:17 AM, which explains your sharp, moody behavior that morning. Snapping at me because you didn\u2019t get much sleep.\n Well, I bought a File Recovery, installed it into my mind depository, despite how expensive it was, to recover mind files \u201cthat are accidentally deleted\u201d goes the description. And, well, our thoughts are files. If you are telling the truth, that your thoughts are in fact work-related, I\u2019ll dump the file recover and I\u2019ll never go behind your back again. It\u2019s the least I can do for doubting you.\n Twenty-four hours it has been since I mentally linked the recovery app to the ThoughtBox. I logged you out from the ThoughtBox as soon as you left for work, but there\u2019s not much I can do for the thought-reporting chip you shot into my neck. The requested files have been recovered. If you catch me going behind your back like this and I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019ll manage your moods for at least a month; they can\u2019t last longer than that, right?\n I\u2019ve been sitting in a locked bathroom in case you come home. Using the hologram screen, a message floats before me: Read through the terms and conditions and press accept to obtain the recovered files. I\u2019m on my knees now, leaning against the bathroom cabinet, and I\u2019m too afraid to accept, too afraid to read the truth. What will I find? Will you still be the same man I fell in love with? I don\u2019t even read the T&C\u2019s, couldn\u2019t be bothered really. I close my eyes and jab my finger against the \u201caccept\u201d icon. A window in gray shades comes up with an .exe file that I must install, which a program in my mind depository can read. Once I run the .exe file, I flip the hologram window with my right hand, and it opens an MTM (mind text messaging) app that allows for free international conversations and shows a list of dated backup files, which are basically thoughts you deleted.\n I hold my breath as the chat opens, obscuring the shower behind it. Fear trickles into my chest when a series of images and texts fill the empty space of the hologram. The first thing I see is a snapshot of someone\u2019s breasts, their thighs, and their insides, like I\u2019m watching a medical procedure through a laparoscope that tunnels its way through them. I clasp my hand to my mouth. My whole world turns black as I try to slap away the images. Is this a joke? The conversations span back one year. I scroll through the messages between you and your correspondent Boothang69, who\u2019s in Shenzhen, China.\n Her profile picture is a photograph of my face, intensely photoshopped. Except, it\u2019s a mask she\u2019s wearing. What sick-minded game is this? Why would another woman want to wear the face of the girlfriend? The masked girl is staring up at the camera, smiling, large eyes, a weave on. She\u2019s squeezing into her breasts, so they appear bigger, the cleavage showing.\n I zoom into the photograph. Before proceeding, I grab her picture with my hand and throw it into the web on another window, hoping the scan will reveal her online identity. I watch the loading icon, a silver light zipping around a circle, and finally a picture comes up. Her name is Gorata Tau. She\u2019s studying for an MBA in China. I flip through her photographs. She\u2019s on the metro. She\u2019s in front of a street with fairy lights. She\u2019s smiling at the camera, and behind her is Canton Complex in Guangzhou with steely skyscrapers. I feel faint, my armpits sticky with sweat. I switch to the other hologram window to read the chats:\n \n Boothang69: I love you, boo. Couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you. 2:44 AM\n You: Send me a picture. I miss her, the warmth between your legs. 2:45 AM\n Boothang69: How about a hologram connection like last time? 2:45 AM\n You: Babe, you got me going crazy. If only I could feel your body. I miss you so badly. I need you back home. 2:45 AM\n Boothang69: Ya know, soon I\u2019ll be there. Isn\u2019t she taking care of you? 2:46 AM\n You: She\u2019s so stiff. She\u2019s not like you. 2:46 AM\n Boothang69: You won\u2019t have to wait so long. One more year left. 2:46 AM\n . . .\n \n You\u2019re really cheating on me. I don\u2019t believe in a fight that some women get into with other women because the guy wronged you. Your partner is the one who committed adultery. What is the point of fighting someone outside the relationship, as if he can\u2019t find another one? Am I then going to hunt down every single woman you cheat on me with? No. This war is between you and I. I scroll down to last night\u2019s messages, which only confuse me more.\n \n Boothang69: Babe. You up? 2:34 AM\n You: Ja, aren\u2019t you in class? 2:39 AM\n Boothang69: It\u2019s 8:40, the lecturer\u2019s running late. 2:40 AM\n You: You feeling better this morning? 2:41 AM\n Boothang69: Fuck, no! 2:41 AM\n Boothang69: Where is she? 2:41 AM\n You: Hibernating. Jesus, she\u2019s a lot of work. She\u2019s not acting according to our plans. 2:42 AM\n Boothang69: WHAT?? 2:42 AM\n Boothang69: Did you find out why she logged you out from the ThoughtBox? 2:43 AM\n Boothang69: Hello? 2:46 AM\n Boothang69: Where are you??? This is bugging me. 2:49 AM\n You: Sorry. It\u2019s almost 3 AM. She was just up for a glass of water. I was still talking to her. 2:50 AM\n Boothang69: What? She can eat now??? Isn\u2019t that dangerous? 2:50 AM\n You: No. The glass was empty. She sees it as filled with water. She \u201cthinks\u201d she can eat and drink, but her plate is always empty. 2:51 AM\n Boothang69: Oh, that\u2019s a relief. 2:52 AM\n You: I didn\u2019t want to tell you this because ur stressed with classes, but the monitoring-and-remote-controlling chip is not working . . . I can\u2019t hear her thoughts. 2:55 AM\n Boothang69: What the fuck! 2:55 AM\n Boothang69: Since when? 2:55 AM\n Boothang69: Why are you only telling me this now????? 2:56 AM\n Boothang69: Oh, modimo. We\u2019re fucked. We\u2019re seriously fucked. We can\u2019t have her running around unsupervised. Do you understand how in serious shit we\u2019ll be??????? 2:57 AM\n Boothang69: Why are you taking forever to respond? This is FUCKING important! 3:07 AM\n You: I\u2019m sorry, babe, I was on a call with a client. 3:13 AM\n Boothang69: Jesus, we need to bury her. 3:13 AM\n You: People around here know her. If she disappears again, I\u2019ll be their first suspect. I\u2019d hate it if you got punished too. 3:14 AM\n Boothang69: My aunt was taken in, incarcerated. She hung herself in a fucking toilet. I can\u2019t go to prison. I won\u2019t survive. 3:14 AM\n You: I won\u2019t let it come to that. I\u2019d rather take the fall than have you suffer. I love you, s\u2019thandwa same. 3:16 AM\n Boothang69: I told you we should\u2019ve never given her an identity. Never. We should\u2019ve hidden her, tied her in a basement or something. 3:16 AM\n Boothang69: I don\u2019t trust her. What the fuck was she doing yesterday? 02:40 AM\n You: She says she was working from home. The gardener said a professional-looking woman visited her. 3:19 AM\n Boothang69: Why the hell are you so calm? I did this for you. 3:19 AM\n You: I know, and I appreciate you for that. Babe, you need to relax. I have her under control. 3:23 AM\n Boothang69: We can\u2019t get caught, ja. 3:23 AM\n Boothang69: This shit is stressing me the fuck out. 3:25 AM\n Boothang69: I can\u2019t sleep. 3:25 AM\n Boothang69: If they find out who she is\u2014Jesus, I keep seeing her face on the news. It\u2019s driving me mad. 3:25 AM\n Boothang69: Where the hell are you? 3:28 AM\n Boothang69: You\u2019re not taking this seriously. 3:35 AM\n You: I\u2019m sorry, babe, I was on another call. Just why does she have to be goddamn difficult? 3:38 AM\n Boothang69: You and that fucking job. You\u2019re always busy! 3:39 AM\n Boothang69: Fuck this. I\u2019m getting on a flight tonight. 3:39 AM\n You: Wait. What?! 3:40 AM\n You: What about your dissertation? Your studies? 3:40 AM\n Boothang69: Are you kidding me? There\u2019ll be no future with this bitch acting out. We need to sort her out. Clearly, you need manpower. 3:41 AM\n You: I\u2019m really sorry. I hate disappointing you. 3:41 AM\n You: You still there? 3:47 AM\n You: Babe, she\u2019s made a lot of money for us in the past year, which paid for your studies. Let\u2019s just run her for another year. Just be patient. 3:52 AM\n Boothang69: No. I am coming home, finish and klaar. Get everything ready. 3:52 AM\n You: Ok. 3:53 AM\n You: What should I prepare? 3:59 AM\n You: Hello? 4:07 AM\n You: Um, have a safe flight. I love you. 4:17 AM\n . . .\n \n The floor is cold under my feet. The knobs of the cabinets have eaten into my back and my spinal cord hurts. I stretch out my legs, refusing to face what I\u2019ve just read. The hologram glows in front of me and the bathroom darkens, clouds overshadowing the sun. These messages are from last night, which means she\u2019ll be arriving tonight at the latest. Why are they so concerned about me and my diet? What identity did they give me? Who is this woman? Why do they need me under their control? What the hell is going on? They want me to disappear. No. No. You wouldn\u2019t do that. I stare at myself in the mirror, your words with your mistress running through my mind:\n I told you we should\u2019ve never given her an identity.\n She\u2019s not acting according to our plans.\n We\u2019re seriously fucked. We can\u2019t have her running around unsupervised.\n She can eat now??? Isn\u2019t that dangerous?\n I keep seeing her face on the news.\n If they find out who she is . . .\n If she disappears again.\n Let\u2019s just run her for another year.\n Who are they referring to that they\u2019re so afraid will find me? You keep seeing my face on the news, and it makes your mistress sick, but how come I haven\u2019t seen my face on the news? If I disappear again? Am I a missing person? Did you take me in?\n I press my hand against the mirror and I feel like a stranger. \u201cWho are you? What have you become? What has he done to me?\u201d I ask, staring at my reflection. I draw my arm back, strike it into the mirror. A sharp sound; glass cascades into the porcelain sink. \u201cWho are you!\u201d I shout at the mirror. I bang my arm again. \u201cWho are you?\u201d My face distorts into anger and confusion.\n When I look down, night-like liquid spills down the white of the sink. I do not bleed like other people. My blood is not red. I have no menstrual cycles. I do not consume food nor liquids. Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? I look at my arm. A shard of glass has sliced it open. The skin is folded back, like an orange peel. I pull it further back, inspecting what lies beneath my skin:\n In my arm, there are fiber cords and not veins.\n There are tubes and steel but no bone.\n So what is in the rest of my body?\n Sensors,\n processors,\n actuators\n in my limbs are responsible for my tactile reception\n that my brain-search can identify.\n I inspect the flap of skin:\n this is lab-harvested biological tissue and muscles,\n fused with technology,\n with a venous network of nano-sized sensor-wires\n meshed onto my endoskeleton\n inside me, there are nanobots used for cell regeneration.\n Aluminum alloy lies beneath this skin like bone.\n I fold into myself on the floor. \u201cWho are you?\u201d I cry to the cloud-eclipsed sun.\n I drag your tongue\n You didn\u2019t come home.\n You stayed at work. Showered at work. Slept at your desk.\n Twenty-four hours I\u2019ve sat here waiting for you. You tell me you\u2019ll be home tonight.\n For one year, you continued this other life, sending each other nude snapshots. I remember our friends during our game nights, lightly telling me over shots how I\u2019m obsessed with you, that I have the peculiar OCD to tend to your every need. Maybe I crave pain. Maybe sadness feels like home. Maybe it\u2019s nice to blame you for something. It feels safer to be in your realm than outside. It\u2019s the only environment I know, from childhood to adulthood. I keep choosing people like you, as if you are all twins in love with your dominant role. Your wrongs make mine feel lesser, make me feel like the perfect human being. Hey, you abuse people. At least I\u2019m better. I may flirt with a guy, keep him wrapped around my finger, but I\u2019d never do anything as bad as that.\n But this. The thing I learn about you. You have crossed the line and that is bullshit. Here\u2019s the thing that no one knows about your charm and your pull-the-crowd humor: you\u2019re the obsessed freak. Obsessed with pussies and demands. Mollycoddled by mummy issues. The sexting. The pictures. Naked bodies. Exchanging these illicit texts. The lies\u2014the damning lies about who I really am. I unpack the ThoughtBox, I autopsy it and rummage through the deleted thoughts. The bare truth in postmortem form lies on my living room floor. You\u2019re a bastard. And I need answers:\n Who am I?\n Who is that woman?\n What is wrong with my body?\n After everything I have done for you. You do this to me? I stare at it, the evidence of you begging her to send you a picture of her vagina, whilst telling me you love me. Not only me. But you\u2019re begging them. Many girls. Girls who want you to stop asking, who tell you to think about me. But you\u2019re persistent. Our neighbors\u2014God, you begged her, wanting to kiss it. Even our friends. Bloody bliksem, no wonder they gave me strange stares when we were together. This is not only embarrassing. You\u2019ve torn the dignity off my body. You\u2019ve left me naked. And everyone knew. Everyone. Except me.\n I search every nook and cranny of news reports online and offline just to find something, something that connects me to something honest and real. And there it is, a hidden report you\u2019ve confiscated from our viewing; it\u2019s a nineteen-year-old woman who disappeared on her walk home from work. Three years ago. Three! When I enlarge the missing-person picture, it is me, except the name is different: Olerato Mosime.\n Who are you? What is beneath that skin of yours? Can I flay you like I did the cats in my old neighborhood? See if you have bone or blood.\n I don\u2019t want any explanations.\n I don\u2019t want your voice and your lies.\n I want you dead.\n When you enter through the door, I\u2019m not your shitty little submissive girlfriend. I knock you out with a fucking pan. The fucking pan you chided me for misusing. I want the pain in my heart to be a bomb in your body. But what is my plan? To kill you and then what? To kill you because you cheated? Because you two kidnapped me? Because you\u2019re planning to do far worse to me? Because you\u2019re both screwing around with me, trying to control me? And what have you done to my body? Why is my blood black?\n I take your life because you took mine. No, you took three years of my life, wasted them, you fucker. And what about my family? My poor family who\u2019ve suffered so many years. Anger, I\u2019ve never felt anger like this. What have I become? I crumble onto my knees. Ashamed of myself. Embarrassed. This is not me. I am not cruel. How can I let this relationship turn me into this ugly thing? You customized me like a sex doll, only I had a mind of my own.\n Lies or not, I dial.\n The operator answers. \u201c999, what is your emergency?\u201d\n \u201cHello,\u201d I wail, swiping blood and tears from my face. \u201cPlease, I need help. I was kidnapped three years ago. I just killed my kidnapper in self-defense. I need help, please.\u201d\n Tlotlo Tsamaase is a Motswana writer of fiction, poetry, and architectural articles.

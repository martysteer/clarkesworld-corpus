To birth forth and then burst forth a thing\u2014a great, sprawling metallo-bio-cyber-thing such as we and you\u2014takes grander musics, such as I know.\nOnly by shrinking down to the narrow chasms of the single view can you know the intricate slick fineness, the reek and tingle and chime of this silky symphony of self.\nBut bigness blunders, thumb-fingered.\nSmallness can enchant. So let us to go an oddment of him, and me, and you:\nHe saw:\nA long thin hard room, fluorescent white, without shadows.\nMetal on ceramo-glass on fake wood on woven nylon rug.\nA granite desk. A man whose name he could not recall.\nA neat uniform, so familiar he looked beyond it by reflex.\nHe felt: light gravity (Mars? the moon?); rough cloth at a cuff of his work shirt; a chill dry air-conditioned breeze along his neck. A red flash of anger.\nBenjan smiled slightly. He had just seen what he must do.\n\u201cGray was free when we began work, centuries ago,\u201d Benjan said, his black eyes fixed steadily on the man across the desk. Katonji, that was the man\u2019s name. His commander, once, a very long time ago.\n\u201cIt had been planned that way, yes,\u201d his superior said haltingly, begrudging the words.\n\u201cThat was the only reason I took the assignment,\u201d Benjan said.\n\u201cI know. Unfortunately\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have spent many decades on it.\u201d\n\u201cFleet Control certainly appreciates\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWorld-scaping isn\u2019t just a job, damn it! It\u2019s an art, a discipline, a craft that saps a man\u2019s energies.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you have done quite well. Personally, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhen you asked me to do this I wanted to know what Fleet Control planned for Gray.\u201d\n\u201cYou can recall an ancient conversation?\u201d\nA verbal maneuver, no more. Katonji was an amplified human and already well over two centuries old, but the Earthside social convention was to pretend that the past faded away, leaving a young psyche. \u201cA \u2018grand experiment in human society,\u2019 I remember your words.\u201d\n\u201cTrue, that was the original plan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut now you tell me a single faction needs it? The whole moon?\u201d\n\u201cThe Council has reconsidered.\u201d\n\u201cReconsidered, hell.\u201d Benjan\u2019s bronze face crinkled with disdain. \u201cSomebody pressured them and they gave in. Who was it?\u201d\n\u201cI would not put it that way,\u201d Katonji said coldly.\n\u201cI know you wouldn\u2019t. Far easier to hide behind words.\u201d He smiled wryly and compressed his thin lips. The view-screen near him looked out on a cold silver landscape and he studied it, smouldering inside. An artificial viewscape from Gray itself. Earth, a crescent concerto in blue and white, hung in a creamy sky over the insect working of robotractors and men. Gray\u2019s air was unusually clear today, the normal haze swept away by a front blowing in from the equator near Mare Chrisum.\nThe milling minions were hollowing out another cavern for Fleet Control to fill with cubicles and screens and memos. Great Gray above, mere gray below. Earth swam above high fleecy cirrus and for a moment Benjan dreamed of the day when birds, easily adapted to the light gravity and high atmospheric density, would flap lazily across such views.\n\u201cOfficer Tozenji\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am no longer an officer. I resigned before you were born.\u201d\n\u201cBy your leave, I meant it solely as an honorific. Surely you still have some loyalty to the Fleet.\u201d\nBenjan laughed. The deep bass notes echoed from the office walls with a curious emptiness. \u201cSo it\u2019s an appeal to the honor of the crest, is it? I see I spent too long on Gray. Back here you have forgotten what I am like,\u2019\u201d Benjan said. But where is \u201chere\u201d? I could not take Earth full gravity any more, so this must be an orbiting Fleet cylinder, spinning gravity.\nA frown. \u201cI had hoped that working once more with Fleet officers would change you, even though you remained a civilian on Gray. A man isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA man is what he is,\u201d Benjan said.\nKatonji leaned back in his shiftchair and made a tent of his fingers. \u201cYou . . . played the Sabal Game during those years?\u201d he asked slowly.\nBenjan\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d The Game was ancient, revered, simplicity itself. It taught that the greater gain lay in working with others, rather than in self-seeking. He had always enjoyed it, but only a fool believed that such moral lessons extended to the cut and thrust of Fleet matters.\n\u201cIt did not . . . bring you to community?\u201d\n\u201cI got on well enough with the members of my team,\u201d Benjan said evenly.\n\u201cI hoped such isolation with a small group would calm your . . . spirit. Fleet is a community of men and women seeking enlightenment in the missions, just as you do. You are an exceptional person, anchored as you are in the Station, using linkages we have not used\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPermitted, you mean.\u201d\n\u201cThose old techniques were deemed . . . too risky.\u201d\nBenjan felt his many links like a background hum, in concert and warm. What could this man know of such methods time-savored by those who lived them? \u201cAnd not easy to direct from above.\u201d\nThe man fastidiously raise a finger and persisted: \u201cWe still sit at the Game, and while you are here would welcome your\u2014\n\u201cCan we leave my spiritual progress aside?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, if you desire.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Now tell me who is getting my planet.\u201d\n\u201cGray is not your planet.\u201d\n\u201cI speak for the Station and all the intelligences who link with it. We made Gray. Through many decades, we hammered the crust, released the gases, planted the spores, damped the winds.\u201d\n\u201cWith help.\u201d\n\u201cThree hundred of us at the start, and eleven heavy spacecraft. A puny beginning that blossomed into millions.\u201d\n\u201cHelped by the entire staff of Earthside\u2014\u201d\n\u201c They were Fleet men. They take orders, I don\u2019t. I work by contract.\u201d\n\u201cA contract spanning centuries?\u201d\n\u201cIt is still valid, though those who wrote it are dust.\u201d\n\u201cLet us treat this in a gentlemanly fashion, sir. Any contract can be renegotiated.\u201d\n\u201cThe paper I\u2014we, but I am here to speak for all\u2014signed for Gray said it was to be an open colony. That\u2019s the only reason I worked on it,\u201d he said sharply.\n\u201cI would not advise you to pursue that point,\u201d Katonji said. He turned and studied the viewscreen, his broad, southern Chinese nose flaring at the nostrils. But the rest of his face remained an impassive mask. For a long moment there was only the thin whine of air circulation in the room.\n\u201cSir,\u201d the other man said abruptly, \u201cI can only tell you what the Council has granted. Men of your talents are rare. We know that, had you undertaken the formation of Gray for a, uh, private interest, you would have demanded more payment.\u201d\n\u201cWrong. I wouldn\u2019t have done it at all.\u201d\n\u201cNonetheless, the Council is willing to pay you a double fee. The Majiken Clan, who have been invested with Primacy Rights to Gray\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\u201c\u2014have seen fit to contribute the amount necessary to reimburse you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSo that\u2019s who\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and all others of the Station, to whom I have been authorized to release funds immediately.\u201d\nBenjan stared blankly ahead for a short moment. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll do a bit of releasing myself,\u201d he murmured, almost to himself.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cOh, nothing. Information?\u201d\n\u201cInfor\u2014. Oh.\u201d\n\u201cThe Clans have a stranglehold on the Council, but not the 3D. People might be interested to know how it came about that a new planet\u2014a rich one, too\u2014was handed over\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOfficer Tozenji\u2014\u201d\nBest to pause. Think. He shrugged, tried on a thin smile. \u201cI was only jesting. Even idealists are not always stupid.\u201d\n\u201cUm. I am glad of that.\u201d\n\u201cLodge the Majiken draft in my account. I want to wash my hands of this.\u201d\nThe other man said something, but Benjan was not listening. He made the ritual of leaving. They exchanged only perfunctory hand gestures. He turned to go, and wondered at the naked, flat room this man had chosen to work in: It carried no soft tones, no humanity, none of the feel of a room that is used, a place where men do work that interests them, so that they embody it with something of themselves. This office was empty in the most profound sense. It was a room for men who lived by taking orders. He hoped never to see such a place again.\nBenjan turned. Stepped\u2014the slow slide of falling, then catching himself, stepped\u2014\nYou fall over Gray.\nSkating down the steep banks of young clouds, searching, driving.\nLuna you know as Gray, as all in Station know it, because pearly clouds deck high in its thick air. It had been gray long before, as well\u2014the aged pewter of rock hard-hammered for billions of years by the relentless sun. Now its air was like soft slate, cloaking the greatest of human handiworks.\nYou raise a hand, gaze at it. So much could come from so small an instrument. You marvel. A small tool, five-fingered slab, working over great stretches of centuries. Seen against the canopy of your craft, it seems an unlikely tool to heft worlds with\u2014\nAnd the thought alone sends you plunging\u2014\nLuna was born small, too small.\nSo the sun had readily stripped it of its early shroud of gas. Luna came from the collision of a Mars-sized world into the primordial Earth. From that colossal crunch\u2014how you wish you could have seen that!\u2014spun a disk, and from that churn Luna condensed redly. The heat of that birth stripped away the moon\u2019s water and gases, leaving it bare to the sun\u2019s glower.\nSo amend that:\nYou steer a comet from the chilly freezer beyond Pluto, swing it around Jupiter, and smacked it into the bleak fields of Mare Chrisium. In bits.\nFor a century, all hell breaks loose. You wait, patient in your Station. It is a craft of fractions: Luna is smaller, so needs less to build an atmosphere.\nThere was always some scrap of gas on the moon\u2014trapped from the solar wind, baked from its dust, perhaps even belched from the early, now long-dead volcanoes. When Apollo descended, bringing the first men, its tiny exhaust plume doubled the mass of the frail atmosphere.\nStill, such a wan world could hold gases for tens of thousands of years; physics said so. Its lesser gravity tugs at a mere sixth of Earth\u2019s hefty grip. So, to begin, you sling inward a comet bearing a third the mass of all Earth\u2019s ample air, a chunk of mountain-sized grimy ice.\nSol\u2019s heat had robbed this world, but mother-massive Earth herself had slowly stolen away its spin. It became a submissive partner in a rigid gavotte, forever tide-locked with one face always smiling at its partner.\nHere you use the iceteroid to double effect. By hooking the comet adroitly around Jupiter, in a reverse swingby, you loop it into an orbit opposite to the customary, docile way that worlds loop around the sun. Go opposite! Retro! Coming in on Luna, the iceball then has ten times the impact energy.\nMere days before it strikes, you blow it apart with meticulous brutality. Smashed to shards, chunks come gliding in all around Luna\u2019s equator, small enough that they cannot muster momentum enough to splatter free of gravity\u2019s grip. Huge cannonballs slam into gray rock, but at angles that prevent them from getting away again.\nEarth admin was picky about this: no debris was to be flung free, to rain down as celestial buckshot on that favored world.\nWithin hours, Luna had air\u2014of a crude sort. You mixed and salted and worked your chemical magicks upon roiling clouds that sported forked lightning. Gravity\u2019s grind provoked fevers, molecular riots.\nMore: as the pellets pelted down, Luna spun up. Its crust echoed with myriad slams and bangs. The old world creaked as it yielded, spinning faster from the hammering. From its lazy cycle of twenty-eight days it sped up to sixty hours\u2014close enough to Earth-like, as they say, for government work. A day still lazy enough.\nEven here, you orchestrated a nuanced performance, coaxed from dynamics. Luna\u2019s axial tilt had been a dull zero. Dutifully it had spun at right angles to the orbital plane of the solar system, robbed it of summers and winters.\nBut you wanted otherwise. Angled just so, the incoming ice nuggets tilted the poles. From such simple mechanics you conjured seasons. And as the gases cooled, icy caps crowned your work.\nYou were democratic, at first: allowing both water and carbon dioxide, with smidgens of methane and ammonia. Here you called upon the appetites of bacteria, sprites you sowed as soon as the winds calmed after bombardment. They basked in sunlight, broke up the methane. The greenhouse blanket quickly warmed the old gray rocks, coveting the heat from the infalls, and soon algae covered them.\nYou watched with pride as the first rain fell. For centuries the dark plains had carried humanity\u2019s imposed, watery names: Tranquility, Serenity, Crises, Clouds, Storms. Now these lowlands of aged lava caught the rains and made muds and fattened into ponds, lakes, true seas. You made the ancient names come true.\nThrough your servant machines, you marched across these suddenly murky lands, bristling with an earned arrogance. They\u2014yourself!\u2014plowed and dug, sampled and salted. Through their eyes and tongues and ears you sat in your high Station and heard the sad baby sigh of the first winds awakening.\nThe Station was becoming more than a bristling canister of metal, by then. Its agents grew, as did you.\nYou smiled down upon the gathering Gray with your quartz eyes and microwave antennas. For you knew what was coming. A mere sidewise glance at rich Earth told you what to expect.\nLike Earth\u2019s tropics now, at Luna\u2019s equator heat drove moist gases aloft. Cooler gas flowed from the poles to fill in. The high wet clouds skated poleward, cooled\u2014and rained down riches.\nOn Earth, such currents are robbed of their water about a third of the way to the poles, and so descend, their dry rasp making a world-wide belt of deserts. Not so on Luna.\nYou had judged the streams of newborn air rightly. Thicker airs than Earth\u2019s took longer to exhaust, and so did not fall until they reached the poles. Thus the new world had no chains of deserts, and one simple circulating air cell ground away in each hemisphere. Moisture worked its magicks.\nYou smiled to see your labors come right. Though anchored in your mammoth Station, you felt the first pinpricks of awareness in the crawlers, flyers and diggers who probed the freshening moon.\nYou tasted their flavors, the brimming possibilities. Northerly winds swept the upper half of the globe, bearing poleward, then swerving toward the west to make mild the occasional mild tornado. (Not all weather should be boring.)\nClouds patroled the air, still fretting over their uneasy births. Day and night came in their slow rhythm, stirring the biological lab that worked below. You sometimes took a moment from running all this, just to watch.\nLunascapes. Great Grayworld.\nWhere day yielded to dark, valleys sank into smoldering blackness. Already a chain of snowy peaks shone where they caught the sun\u2019s dimming rays, and lit the plains with slanting colors like live coals. Sharp mountains cleaved the cloud banks, leaving a wake like that of a huge ship. At the fat equator, straining still to adjust to the new spin, tropical thunderheads glowered, lit by orange lightning that seemed to be looking for a way to spark life among the drifting molecules.\nAll that you did, in a mere decade. You had made \u201cthe lesser light that rules the night\u201d now shine five times brighter, casting sharp shadows on Earth. Sunrays glinted by day from the young oceans, dazzling the eyes on Earth. And the mother world itself reflected in those muddy seas, so that when the alignment was right, people on Earth\u2019s night side gazed up into their own mirrored selves. Viewed at just the right angle, Earth\u2019s image was rimmed with ruddy sunlight, refracting through Earth\u2019s air.\nYou knew it could not last, but were pleased to find the new air stick around. It would bleed away in ten thousand years, but by that time other measures could come into play. You had plans for a monolayer membrane to cap your work, resting atop the whole atmosphere, the largest balloon ever conceived.\nLater? No, act in the moment\u2014and so you did.\nYou wove it with membrane skill, cast it wide, let it fall\u2014to rest easy on the thick airs below. Great holes in it let ships glide through and fro, but the losses from those would be trivial.\nNot that all was perfect. Luna had no soil, only the damaged dust left from four billion years beneath the solar wind\u2019s anvil.\nAfter a mere momentary decade (nothing, to you), fresh wonders bloomed.\nMaking soil from gritty grime was work best left to the micro-beasts who loved such stuff. To do great works on a global scale took tiny assistants. You fashioned them in your own labs, which poked outward from the Station\u2019s many-armed skin.\nGray grew a crust. Earth is in essence a tissue of microbial organisms living off the sun\u2019s fires. Gray would do the same, in fast-forward. You cooked up not mere primordial broths, but endless chains of regulatory messages, intricate feedback loops, organic gavottes.\nEarth hung above, an example of life ornamented by eleborate decorations, structures of forest and grass and skin and blood\u2014living quarters, like seagrass and zebras and eucalyptus and primates.\nDo the same, you told yourself. Only better.\nThese tasks you loved. Their conjuring consumed more decades, stacked end on end. You were sucked into the romance of tiny turf wars, chemical assaults, microbial murders and invasive incests. But you had to play upon the stellar stage, as well.\nYou had not thought about the tides. Even you had not found a way around those outcomes of gravity\u2019s gradient. Earth raised bulges in Gray\u2019s seas a full twenty meters tall. That made for a dim future for coastal property, even once the air became breathable.\nLuckily, even such colossal tides were not a great bother to the lakes you shaped in crater beds. These you made as breeding farms for the bioengineered minions who ceaselessly tilled the dirts, massaged the gases, filtered the tinkling streams that cut swift ways through rock.\nIndeed, here and there you even found a use for the tides. There were more watts lurking there, in kinetic energy. You fashioned push-plates to tap some of it, to run your sub-stations. Thrifty gods do not have to suck up to (and from) Earthside.\nAnd so the sphere that, when you began, had been the realm of strip miners amd mass-driver camps, of rugged, suited loners . . . became a place where, someday, humans might walk and breathe free.\nThat time is about to come. You yearn for it. For you, too, can then manifest yourself, your Station, as a mere mortal . . . and set foot upon a world that you would name Selene.\nYou were both Station and more, by then. How much more few knew. But some sliver of you clung to the name of Benjan\u2014\n\u2014Benjan nodded slightly, ears ringing for some reason.\nThe smooth, sure interviewer gave a short introduction. \u201cMan . . . or manifestation? This we must all wonder as we greet an embodiment of humanity\u2019s greatest\u2014and now ancient\u2014construction project. One you and I can see every evening in the sky\u2014for those who are still surface dwellers.\u201d\n3D cameras moved in smooth arcs through the studio darkness beyond. The two men sat in a pool of light. The interviewer spoke toward the directional mike as he gave the background on Benjan\u2019s charges against the Council.\nSmiles galore. Platitudes aplenty. That done, came the attack.\n\u201cBut isn\u2019t this a rather abstract, distant point to bring at this time?\u201d the man said, turning to Benjan.\nBenjan blinked, uncertain, edgy. He was a private man, used to working alone. Now that he was moving against the Council he had to bear these public appearances, these . . . manifestations . . . of a dwindled self. \u201cTo, ah, the people of the next generation, Gray will not be an abstraction\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the moon?\u201d\n\u201cUh, yes, Gray is my name for it. That\u2019s the way it lookled when I\u2014uh, we all\u2014started work on it centuries ago.\u201d\n\u201cYet you were there all along, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. But when I\u2019m\u2014we\u2019re\u2014done.\u201d Benjan leaned forward, and his interviewer leaned back, as if not wanting to be too close. \u201cit will be a real place, not just an idea\u2014where you all can live and start a planned ecology. It will be a frontier.\u201d\n\u201cWe understand that romantic tradition, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Gray isn\u2019t just an idea, it\u2019s something 1\u2019ve\u2014we\u2019ve\u2014worked on for everyone, whatever shape or genetype they might favor.\u201d\n\u201cYes yes, and such ideas are touching in their, well, customary way, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut the only ones who will ever enjoy it, if the Council gets away with this, is the Majiken Clan.\u201d\nThe interviewer pursed his lips. Or was this a he at all? In the current style, the bulging muscles and thick neck might just be fashion statements. \u201cWell, the Majiken are a very large, important segment of the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo more important than the rest of humanity, in my estimation.\u201d\n\u201cBut to cause this much stir over a world which will not even be habitable for at least decades more\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe of the Station are there now.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been modified, adapted.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes. I couldn\u2019t do this interview on Earth. I\u2019m grav-adapted.\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, that\u2019s why many feel that we need to put Earthside people on the ground on Luna as soon as possible. To represent our point of view.\u201d\n\u201cLook, Gray\u2019s not just any world. Not just a gas giant, useful for raw gas and nothing else. Not a Mercury type; there are millions of those littered out among the stars. Gray is going to be fully Earthlike. The astronomers tell us there are only four semiterrestrials outside the home system that humans can ever live on, around other stars, and those are pretty terrible. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou forget the Outer Colonies,\u201d the interviewer broke in smoothly, smiling at the 3D.\n\u201cYeah\u2014iceballs.\u201d He could not hide his contempt. What he wanted to say, but knew it was terribly old fashioned, was: Damn it, Gray is happening now, we\u2019ve got to plan for it. Photosynthesis is going on. I\u2019ve seen it myself\u2014hell, I caused it myself\u2014carbon dioxide and water converting into organics and oxygen, gases fresh as a breeze. Currents carry the algae down through the cloud layers into the warm areas, where they work just fine. That gives off simple carbon compounds, raw carbon and water. This keeps the water content of the atmosphere constant, but converts carbon dioxide\u2014we\u2019ve got too much right now\u2014into carbon and oxygen. It\u2019s going well, the rate itself is exponentiating\u2014\nBenjan shook his fist, just now realizing that he was saying all this out loud, after all. Probably not a smart move, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. \u201cLook, there\u2019s enough water in Gray\u2019s deep rock to make an ocean a meter deep all the way around the planet. That\u2019s enougn to resupply the atmosopheric loss, easy, even without breaking up the rocks. Our designer plants are doing their jobs.\u201d\n\u201cWe have heard of these routine miracles\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014and there can be belts of jungle\u2014soon! We\u2019ve got mountains for climbing, rivers that snake, polar caps, programmed animals coming up, beautiful sunsets, soft summer storms\u2014anything the human race wants. That\u2019s the vision we had when we started Gray. And I\u2019m damned if I\u2019m going to let the Majiken\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut the Majiken can defend Gray,\u201d the interviewer said mildly.\nBenjan paused. \u201cOh, you mean\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, the ever-hungry Outer Colonies. Surely if Gray proves as extraordinary as you think, the rebellious colonies will attempt to take it.\u201d The man gave Benjan a broad, insincere smile. Dummy, it said. Don\u2019t know the real-politic of this time, do you?\nHe could see the logic. Earth had gotten soft, fed by a tougher empire that now stretched to the chilly preserve beyond Pluto. To keep their manicured lands clean and \u201coriginal\u201d Earthers had burrowed underground, built deep cities there, and sent most manufacturing off-world. The real economic muscle now lay in the hands of ther suppliers of fine rocks and volatiles, shipped on long orbits from the Outers and the Belt. These realities were hard to remember when your attention was focused on the details of making a fresh world. One forgot that appetites ruled, not reason.\nBenjan grimaced. \u201cThe Majiken fight well, they are the backbone of the Fleet, yes. Still, to give them a world\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSurely in time there will be others,\u201d the man said reasonably.\n\u201cOh? Why should there be? We can\u2019t possibly make Venus work, and Mars will take thousands of years more\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I meant built worlds\u2014stations.\u201d\nHe snorted. \u201cLive inside a can?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you do,\u201d the man shot back.\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . different.\u201d\n\u201cAh yes.\u201d The interviewer bore in, lips compressed to a white line, and the 3Ds followed him, snouts peering. Benjan felt hopelessly outmatched. \u201cAnd just how so?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . a man chosen to represent . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe Shaping Station, correct?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m of the breed who have always lived in and for the Station.\u201d\n\u201cNow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m sure our audience really wants to get into. After all, the moon won\u2019t be ready for a long time. But you\u2014an ancient artifact, practically\u2014are more interesting.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201d Stony, frozen.\n\u201cWhy not.\u201d Not really a question.\n\u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here as a public figure!\u201d\n\u201cOnly because you require it. Nobody wants to talk to the Station directly.\u201d\n\u201cWe do not converse with such strange machines.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a machine.\u201d\n\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\n\u201cAn . . . idea,\u201d he finished lamely. \u201cAn . . . ancient one.\u201d How to tell them? Suddenly, he longed to be back doing a solid, worthy job\u2014flying a jet in Gray\u2019s skies, pushing along the organic chemistry\u2014\nThe interviewer looked uneasy. \u201cWell, since you won\u2019t go there . . . Our time\u2019s almost up and\u2014\u201d\nAgain, I am falling over Gray.\nMisty auburn clouds, so thin they might be only illusion, spread below the ship. They caught red as dusk fell. The thick air refracted six times more than Earth\u2019s, so sunsets had a slow-motion grandeur, the full pallet of pinks and crimsons and rouge-reds.\nI am in a ramjet\u2014the throttled growl is unmistakable\u2014lancing cleanly into the upper atmosphere. Straps tug and pinch me as the craft banks and sweeps, the smoothly wrenching way I like it, the stubby snout sipping precisely enough for the air\u2019s growing oxygen fraction to keep the engine thrusting forward.\nI probably should not have come on this flight; it is an uncharacteristic self-indulgence. But I could not sit forever in the Station to plot and plan and calculate and check. I had to see my handiwork, get the feel of it. To use my body in the way it longed for.\nI make the ramjet arc toward Gray\u2019s night side. The horizon curves away, clean hard blue-white, and\u2014chungl\u2014I take a jolt as the first canister blows off the underbelly below my feet. Through a rearview camera I watch it tumble away into ruddy oblivion. The canister carries more organic cutures, a new matrix I selected carefully back on Station, in my expanded mode. I watch the shiny morsel explode below, yellow flash. It showers intricate, tailored algae through the clouds.\nGray is at a crucial stage. Since the centuries-ago slamming by the air-giving comets, the conspiracy of spin, water and heat (great gifts of astro-engineering) had done their deep work. Volcanoes now simmered, percolating more moisture from deep within, kindling, kindling. Some heat climbed to the high cloud decks and froze into thin crystals.\nThere, I conjure fresh life\u2014tinkering, endlessly.\nLife, yes. Carefully engineered cells, to breathe carbon dioxide and live off the traces of other gases this high from the surface. In time. Photosynthesis in the buoyant forms\u2014gas-bag trees, spindly but graceful in the top layer of Gray\u2019s dense air\u2014conjure carbon dioxide into oxygen.\nI glance up, encased in the tight flight jacket, yet feeling utterly free, naked. Incoming meteors. Brown clouds of dust I had summoned to orbit about Gray were cutting off some sunlight.\nAdded spice, these\u2014ingredients sent from the asteroids to pepper the soil, prick the air, speed chemical matters along. The surface was cooling, the Gray greenhouse winding down. Losing the heat from the atmosphere\u2019s birth took centuries. Patience, prudence.\nNow chemical concerts in the rocks slowed. I felt those, too, as a distant sampler hailed me with its accountant\u2019s chattering details. Part of the song. Other chem chores, more subtle, would soon become energetically possible. Fluids could seep and run. In the clotted air below, crystals and cells would make their slow work. All in time . . .\nIn time, the first puddle had become a lake. How I had rejoiced then!\nCenturies ago I wanted to go swimming in the clear blue seas of luna, I remember. Tropical waters at the equator, under Earthshine . . .\nWhat joy it had been, to fertilize those early, still waters with minutely programmed bacteria, stir and season their primordial soup\u2014and wait.\nWhat sweet mother Earth did in a billion years I did to Gray in fifty. Joyfully! Singing the song of the molecules, in concert with them.\nMy steps were many, the methods subtle. To shape the mountain ranges I needed further infalls from small asteroids, taking a century\u2014ferrying rough-cut stone to polish a jewel.\nMemories . . . of a man and more. Fashioned from the tick of time, ironed out by the swift passage of mere puny years, of decades, of the ringing centuries. Worlds take time.\nMy ramjet leaps into night, smelling of hot iron and \u2014chung!\u2014discharging its burden.\nI glance down at wisps of yellow-pearl. Sulphuric and carbolic acid streamers, drifting far below. There algae feed and prosper. Murky mists below pale, darken, vanish. Go!\nYet I felt a sudden sadness as the jet took me up again. I had watched every small change in the atmosphere, played shepherd to newborn cloud banks, raised fresh chains of volcanoes with fusion triggers that burrowed like moles\u2014and all this might come to naught, if it became another private preserve for some Earthside power games.\nI could not shake off the depression. Should I have that worry pruned away? It could hamper my work, and I could easily be rid of it for a while, when I returned to the sleeping vaults. Most in the Station spent about one month per year working;. Their other days passed in dreamless chilled sleep, waiting for the slow metabolism of Gray to quicken and change.\nNot I. I slept seldom, and did not want the stacks of years washed away.\nI run my tongue over fuzzy teeth. I am getting stale, worn. Even a ramjet ride did not revive my spirit.\nAnd the Station did not want slackers. Not only memories could be pruned.\nAncient urges arise, needs . . .\nA warm shower and rest await me above, in orbit, inside the mother-skin. Time to go.\nI touch the controls, cutting in extra ballastic computer capacity and\u2014\n\u2014suddenly I am there again, with her.\nShe is around me and beneath me, slick with ruby sweat.\nAnd the power of it soars up through me. I reach out and her breast blossoms in my eager hand, her soft cries unfurl in puffs of green steam. Aye!\nShe is a splash of purple across the cool lunar stones, her breath ringing in me\u2014\nas she licks my rasping ear with a tiny jagged fork of puckered laughter,\nmost joyful and triumpant, yea verity.\nThe Station knows you need this now.\nYes, and the Station is right. I need to be consumed, digested, spat back out a new and fresh man, so that I may work well again.\n\u2014so she coils and swirls like a fine tinkling gas around me, her mouth wraps me like a vortex. I slide my shaft into her gratefully\nas she sobs great wracking orange gaudiness through me,\nher, again, her,\ngift of the strumming vast blue Station that guides us all down centuries of dense, oily time.\nYou need this, take, eat, this is the body and blood of the Station, eat, savor, take fully.\nI had known her once\u2014redly, sweet and loud\u2014and now I know her again,\nmy senses all piling up and waiting to be eaten from her.\nI glide back and forth, moisture chimes between us, she is coiled tight, too.\nWe all are, we creatures of the Station.\nIt knows this, releases us when we must be gone.\nI slam myself into her because she is both that woman\u2014known so long ago, delicious in her whirlwind passions, supple in colors of the mind, singing in rubs and heats\nI knew across the centuries. So the Station came to know her, too, and duly recorded her\u2014 so that I can now bury my coal-black, sweaty troubles in her, aye! and thus in the Shaping Station, as was and ever shall be, Grayworld without end, amen.\nResting. Compiling himself again, letting the rivulets of self knit up into remembrance.\nOf course the Station had to be more vast and able than anything Humanity had yet known.\nAt the time the Great Shaping began, it was colossal. By then, humanity had gone on to grander projects.\nMars brimmed nicely with vapors and lichen, but would take millennia more before anyone could walk its surface with only a compressor to take and thicken oxygen from the swirling airs.\nMammoth works now cruised at the outer rim of the solar system, vast ice castles inhabited by beings only dimly related to the humans of Earth.\nHe did not know those constructions. But he had been there, in inherited memory, when the Station was born. For part of him and you and me and us had voyaged forth at the very beginning . . .\nThe numbers were simple, their implications known to school children.\n(Let\u2019s remember that the future belongs to the engineers.)\nTake an asteroid, say, and slice it sidewise, allowing four meters of head room for each level\u2014about what a human takes to live in. This dwelling, then, has floor space that expands as the cube of the asteroid size. How big an asteroid could provide the living room equal to the entire surface of the Earth? Simple: about two hundred kilometers.\nNothing, in other words. For Ceres, the largest asteroid in the inner belt, was 380 kilometers across, before humans began to work her.\nBut room was not the essence of the Station. For after all, he had made the Station, yes? Information was her essence, the truth of that blossomed in him, the past as prologue\u2014\nHe ambled along a corridor a hundred meters below Gray\u2019s slag and muds, gazing down on the frothy air-fountains in the foyer. Day\u2019s work done.\nEven manifestations need a rest, and the interview with the smug Earther had put him off, sapping his resolve. Inhaling the crisp, cold air (a bit high on the oxy, he thought; have to check that) he let himself concentrate wholly on the clear scent of the splashing. The blue water was the very best, fresh from the growing poles, not the recycled stuff he endured on flights. He breathed in the tingling spray and a man grabbed him.\n\u201cI present formal secure-lock,\u201d the man growled, his third knuckle biting into Benjan\u2019s elbow port.\nA cold, brittle thunk. His systems froze. Before he could move, whole command linkages went dead in her inboards. The Station\u2019s hovering presence, always humming in the distance, telescoped away. It felt like a wrenching fall that never ends, head over heels\u2014\nHe got a grip. Focus. Regain your links. The loss!\u2014It was like having fingers chopped away, whole pieces of himself amputated. Bloody neural stumps\u2014\nHe sent quick, darting questions down his lines, and met . . . dark. Silent. Dead.\nHis entire aura of presence was gone. He sucked in the cold air, letting a fresh anger bubble up but keeping it tightly bound.\nHis attacker was the sort who blended into the background. Perfect for this job. A nobody out of nowhere, complete surprise. Clipping on a hand-restraint, the mousy man stepped back. \u201cThey ordered me to do it fast.\u201d A mousy voice, too.\nBenjan resisted the impulse to deck him. He looked Lunar, thin and pale. One of the Earther families who had come to deal with the Station a century ago? Maybe with more kilos than Benjan, but a fair match. And it would feel good.\nBut that would just bring more of them, in the end. \u201cDamn it, I have immunity from casual arrest. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo matter now, they said.\u201d The cop shrugged apologetically, but his jaw set. He was used to this.\nBenjan vaguely recognized him, from some bar near the Apex of the crater\u2019s dome. There weren\u2019t more than a thousand people on Gray, mostly like him, manifestations of the Station. But not all. More of the others all the time . . . \u201cYou\u2019re Majiken.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. So?\u201d\n\u201cAt least you people do your own work.\u201d\n\u201cWe have plenty on the inside here. You don\u2019t think Gray\u2019s gonna be neglected, eh?\u201d\nIn his elbow he felt injected programs spread, clunk, consolidating their blocks. A seeping ache. Benjan fought it all through his neuro-musculars, but the disease was strong.\nKeep your voice level, wait for a chance. Only one of them\u2014my God, they\u2019re sure of themselves! Okay, make yourself seem like a doormat.\n\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can get a few things from my office?\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Fraid not.\u201d\n\u201cMighty decent.\u201d\nThe man shrugged, letting the sarcasm pass. \u201cThey want you locked down good before they . . . \u201d\n\u201cThey what?\u201d\n\u201cMake their next move, I\u2019d guess.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just a step, eh?\u201d\n\u201cSure, chop off the hands and feet first.\u201d A smirking thug with a gift for metaphor.\nWell, these hands and feet can still work. Benjan began walking toward his apartment. \u201cI\u2019ll stay in your lock-down, but at home.\u201d\n\u201cHey, nobody said\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the harm? I\u2019m deadened now.\u201d He kept walking.\n\u201cUh, uh\u2014\u201d The man paused, obviously consulting with his superiors on an in-link.\nHe should have known it was coming. The Majikens were ferret-eyed, canny, unoriginal and always dangerous. He had forgotten that. In the rush to get ores sifted, grayscapes planed right to control the constant rains, a system of streams and rivers snaking through the fresh-cut valleys . . . a man could get distracted, yes. Forget how people were. Careless.\nNot completely, though. Agents like this Luny usually nailed their prey at home, not in a hallway. Benjan kept a stunner in the apartment, right beside the door, convenient.\nDistract him. \u201cI want to file a protest.\u201d\n\u201cTake it to Kalespon.\u201d Clipped, efficient, probably had a dozen other slices of bad news to deliver today. To other manifestations. Busy man.\n\u201cNo, with your boss.\u201d\n\u201cMine?\u201d His rock-steady jaw went slack.\n\u201cFor\u2014\u201d he sharply turned the corner to his apartment, using the time to reach for some mumbo-jumbo\u2014\u201cfelonious interrogation of inboards.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t touch your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI felt it. Slimy little gropes\u2014yeccch!\u201d Might as well ham it up a little, have some fun.\nThe Majiken looked offended. \u201cI never violate protocols. The integrity of your nexus is intact. You can ask for a scope-through when we take you in\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get my overnight kit.\u201d Only now did he hurry toward the apartment portal and popped it by an inboard command. As he stepped through he felt the cop, three steps behind.\nHere goes. One foot over the lip, turn to the right, snatch the stunner out of its grip mount\u2014\n\u2014and it wasn\u2019t there. They\u2019d laundered the place already. \u201cDamn!\u201d\n\u201cThought it\u2019d be waitin\u2019, huh?\u201d\nIn the first second. When the Majiken was pretty sure of himself, act\u2014\nBenjan took a step back and kicked. A satisfying soft thuuunk.\nIn the low gravity the man rose a meter and his uungh! was strangely satisfying. The Majiken were warriors, after all, by heritage. Easier for them to take physical damage than life trauma.\nThe Majiken came up fast and nailed Benjan with a hand feint and slam. Benjan fell back in the slow gravity\u2014and at a 45-degree tilt, sprang backward, away, toward the wall\u2014\nWhich he hit, completing his turn in air, heels coming hard into the wall so that he could absorb the recoil\u2014\n\u2014and spring off, head-height\u2014\n\u2014into the Majiken\u2019s throat as the man rushed forward, shaped hands ready for the put-away blow. Benjan caught him with both hand-edges, slamming the throat from both sides. The punch cut off blood to the head and the Majiken crumbled.\nBenjan tied him with his own belt. Killed the link on the screen. Bound him further to the furniture. Even on Gray, inertia was inertia. The Majiken would not find it easy to get out from under a couch he was firmly tied to.\nThe apartment would figure out that something was wrong about its occupant in an hour or two, and call for help. Time enough to run? Benjan was unsure, but part of him liked this, felt a surge of adrenaline joy arc redly through his systems.\nFive minutes of work and he got the interlocks off. His connections sprang back to life. Colors and images sang in his aura.\nHe was out the door, away\u2014\nThe cramped corridors seemed to shrink, dropping down and away from him, weaving and collapsing. Something came toward him\u2014chalk-white hills, yawning craters.\nA hurricane breath whipped by him as it swept down from the jutting, fresh-carved mountains. His body strained.\nHe was running, that much seeped through to him. He breathed brown murk that seared but his lungs sucked it in eagerly.\nPlunging hard and heavy across the swampy flesh of Gray.\nHe moved easily, bouncing with each stride in the light gravity, down an infinite straight line between rows of enormous trees. Vegetable trees, these were, soft tubers and floppy leaves in the wan glow of a filtered sun. There should be no men here, only machines to tend the crops. Then he noticed that he was not a man at all. A robo-hauler, yes\u2014and his legs were in fact wheels, his arms the working grapplers. Yet he read all this as his running body. Somehow it was pleasant.\nAnd she ran with him.\nHe saw beside him a miner-bot, speeding down the slope. Yet he knew it was she, Martine, and he loved her.\nHe whirred, clicked\u2014and sent a hail.\nYou are fair, my sweet.\nBack from the lumbering miner came, This body will not work well at games of lust.\nNo reason we can\u2019t shed them in time.\nTo what end? she demanded. Always imperious, that girl.\nTo slide silky skin again.\nYou seem to forget that we are fleeing. That cop, someone will find him.\nIn fact, he had forgotten. Uh . . . update me?\nAh! How exasperating! You\u2019ve been off, romping through your imputs again, right?\nWorse than that. He had only a slippery hold on the jiggling, surging lands of mud and murk that funneled past. Best not to alarm her, though. My sensations seem to have become a bit scrambled, yes. I know there is some reason to run\u2014\nThey are right behind us!\nWho?\nThe Majiken Clan! They want to seize you as a primary manifestation!\nDamn! I\u2019m fragmenting.\nYou mean they\u2019re reaching into your associative cortex?\nMust be, my love. Which is why you\u2019re running with me.\nWhat do you mean?\nHow to tell her the truth but shade it so that she does not guess . . . the Truth? Suppose I tell you something that is more useful than accurate?\nWhy would you do that, m\u2019love?\nWhy do doctors slant a diagnosis?\nBecause no good diagnostic gives a solid prediction.\nExactly. Not what he had meant, but it got them by an awkward fact.\nCome on, she sent. Let\u2019s scamper down this canyon. The topo maps say it\u2019s a short cut.\nCan\u2019t trust \u2018em, the rains slice up the land so fast. He felt his legs springing like pistons in the mad buoyance of adrenaline.\nThey surged together down slippery sheets that festered with life\u2014spreading algae, some of the many-leaved slim-trees Benjan had himself helped design. Rank growths festooned the banks of dripping slime, biology run wild and woolly at a fevered pace, irked by infusions of smart bugs. A landscape on fast forward.\nWhat do you fear so much? she said suddenly\nThe sharpness of it stalls his mind. He was afraid for her more than himself, but how to tell her? This apparition of her was so firm and heartbreakingly warm, her whole presence welling through to him on his sensorium . . . Time to tell another truth that conceals a deeper truth.\nThey\u2019ll blot out every central feature of me, all those they can find.\nIf they catch you. Us.\nYup. Keep it to monosyllables, so the tremor of his voice does not give itself away. If they got to her, she would face final, total erasure. Even of a fragment self.\nSave your breath for the run, shesent. So he did, gratefully.\nIf there were no omni-sensors lurking along this approach to the launch fields, they might get through. Probably Fleet expected him to stay indoors, hiding, working his way to some help. But there would be no aid there. The Majikan were thorough and would capture all human manifestations, timing the arrests simultaneously to prevent anyone sending a warning. That was why they had sent a lone cop to grab him; they were stretched thin. Reassuring, but not much.\nIt was only three days past the 3D interview, yet they had decided to act and put together a sweep. What would they be doing to the Station itself? He ached at the thought. After all, she resided there . . .\nAnd she was here. He was talking to a manifestation that was remarkable, because he had opened his inputs in a way that only a crisis can spur.\nBenjan grimaced. Decades working over Gray had aged him, taught him things Fleet could not imagine. The Sabal Game still hummed in his mind, still guided his thoughts, but these men of the Fleet had betrayed all that. They thought, quite probably, that they could recall him to full officer status,and he would not guess that they would then silence him, quite legally.\nDid they think him so slow? Benjan allowed himself a thin, dry chuckle as he ran.\nThey entered the last short canyon before the launch fields. Tall blades like scimitar grasses poked up, making him dart among them. She growled and spun her tracks and plowed them under. She did not speak. None of them liked to destroy the life so precariously remaking Gray. Each crushed blade was a step backward.\nHis quarters were many kilometers behind by now, and soon these green fields would end. If he had judged the map correctly\u2014yes, there it was. A craggy peak ahead, crowned with the somber lights of the launch station. They would be operating a routine shift in there, not taking any special precautions.\nAbruptly he burst from the thicket of thick-leaved plants and charged down the last slope. Before him lay the vast lava plain of Oberg Plateau, towering above the Fogg Sea. Now it was a mud flat, foggy, littered with ships. A vast dark hole yawned in the bluff nearby, the slanting sunlight etching its rimmed locks. It must be the exit tube for the electromagnetic accelerator, now obsolete, unable to fling any more loads of ore through the cloak of atmosphere.\nA huge craft loomed at the base of the bluff. A cargo vessel probably; far too large and certainly too slow. Beyond lay an array of robot communications vessels, without the bubble of a life support system. He rejected those, too, ran on.\nShe surged behind him. They kept electromagnetic silence now.\nHis breath came faster and he sucked at the thick, cold air, then had to stop for a moment in the shadow of the cruiser to catch his breath. Above he thought he could make out the faint green tinge of the atmospheric cap in the membrane that held Gray\u2019s air. He would have to find his way out through the holes in it, too, in an unfamiliar ship.\nHe glanced around, searching. To the side stood a small craft, obviously Jump type. No one worked at its base. In the murky fog that shrouded the mud flat he could see a few men and robo-servers beside nearby ships. They would wonder what he was up to. He decided to risk it. He broke from cover and ran swiftly to the small ship. The hatch opened easily.\nGaining lift with the ship was not simple, and so he called on his time-sense accelerations, to the max. That would cost him mental energy later. Right now, he wanted to be sure there was a later at all.\nRoaring flame drove him into the pearly sky.\nFinding the exit hole in the membrane proved easier. He flew by pure eyeballed grace, slamming the acceleration until it was nearly a straight-line problem, like shooting a rifle. Fighting a mere sixth of a g had many advantages.\nAnd now, where to go?\nA bright arc flashed behind Benjan\u2019s eyelids, showing the fans of purpling blood vessels. He heard the dark, whispering sounds of an inner void. A pit opened beneath him and the falling sensation began\u2014he had run over the boundaries this body could attain. His mind had overpowered the shrieking demands of the muscles and nerves, and now he was shutting down, harking to the body\u2019s calls . . .\nAnd she?\nI am here, m\u2019love. The voice came warm and moist, wrapping him in it as he faded, faded, into a gray of his own making.\nShe greeted him at the Station.\nShe held shadowed inlets of rest. A cup brimming with water,\na distant chime of bells, the sweet damp air of early morning.\nHe remembered it so well, the ritual of meditation in his Fleet training,\nthe days of quiet devotion through simple duties that strengthened the mind.\nEverything had been of a piece then.\nBefore Gray grew to greatness, before conflict and aching doubt,\nbefore the storm that raged red through his mind, like\u2014\n\u2014Wind, snarling his hair, a hard winter afternoon as he walked back to his quarters . . .\n\u2014then, instantly, \u2014the cold prickly sensation of diving through shimmering spheres of wate rin zero gravity. The huge bubbles trembled and refracted the yellow light into his eyes. He laughed.\n\u2014scalding black rock faces rose on Gray. Wedges thrust upward as the tortured skin of the planet writhed and buckled. He watched it by remote camera, seeing only a few hundred yards through the choking clouds of carbon dioxide. He felt the rumble of earthquakes, the ominous murmur of a mountain chain being born.\n\u2014a man running, scuttling like an insect across the tortured face of Gray. Above him the great membrane clasped the atmosphere, pressing it down on him, pinning him, a beetle beneath glass. But it is Fleet that wishes to pin him there, to snarl him in the threads of duty. And as the ship arcs upward at the sky he feels a tide of joy, of freedom.\n\u2014twisted shrieking trees, leaves like leather and apples that gleam blue. Moisture beading on fresh crimson grapes beneath a white-hot star.\n\u2014sharp synapses, ferrite cores, spinning drums of cold electrical memory. Input and output. Copper terminals (male or female?), scanners, channels, electrons pouring through p-n-p junctions. Memory mired in quantum noise.\nIndex. Catalog. Transform. Fourier components, the infinite wheeling dance of Laplace and Gauss and Hermite.\nAnd through it all she is there with him, through centuries to keep him whole and sane and yet he does not know, across such vaults of time and space . . . who is he?\nMany: us. One: I. Others: you. Did you think that the marriage of true organisms and fateful machines with machine minds would make a thing that could at last know itself? This is a new order of being but it is not a god.\nUs: one, We: you, He: I.\nAnd yet you suspect you are . . . different . . . somehow.\nThe Majiken ships were peeling off from their orbits, skating down through the membrane holes, into my air!\nThey gazed down, tense and wary, these shock troops in their huddled lonely carriages. Not up, where I lurk.\nFor I am iceball and stony-frag, fruit of the icesteroids. Held in long orbit for just such a (then) far future. (Now) arrived.\nDown I fall in my myriads. Through the secret membrane passages I/we/you made decades before, knowing that a bolthole is good. And that bolts slam true in both directions.\nDown, down\u2014through gray decks I have cooked, artful ambrosias, pewter terraces I have sculpted to hide my selves as they guide the rocks and bergs\u2014after them!\u2014\nThe Majiken ships, ever-wary of fire from below, never thinking to glance up. I fall upon them in machine-gun violences, my ices and stones ripping their craft, puncturing. They die in round-mouthed surprise, these warriors.\nI, master of hyperbolic purpose, shred them.\nI, orbit-master to Gray.\nConflict has always provoked anxiety within him, a habit he could never correct, and so:\n\u2014in concert we will rise to full congruence with F(x)\nand sum over all variables and integrate over the contour\nencapsulating all singularities. It is right and meet so to do.\nHe sat comfortably, rocking on his heels in meditation position.\nWater dripped in a cistern nearby and he thought his mantra,\nletting the sound curl up from within him. A thought entered,\nflickered across his mind as though a bird,\nand left.\nShe she she she\nThe mantra returned in its flowing green rhythmic beauty and he entered\nthe crystal state of thought within thought,\nconsciousness regarding itself without detail or structure.\nThe air rested upon him, the earth groaned beneath with the weight of continents,\nshouting sweet stars wheeled in a chanting cadence above.\nHe was in place and focused, man and boy and elder at once,\nofficer of Fleet, mind encased in matter, body summed into mind\u2014\n\u2014and she came to him, cool balm of aid, succor, yet beneath her palms his muscles warmed, warmed\u2014\nHis universe slides into night. Circuits close. Oscillating electrons carry information, senses, fragments of memory.\nI swim in the blackness. There are long moments of no sensations, nothing to see or hear or feel. I grope\u2014\nHer? No, she is not here either. Cannot be. For she has been dead these centuries and lives only in your Station, where she knows not what has become of herself.\nAt last I seize upon some frag, will it to expand. A strange watery vision floats into view. A man is peering at him. There is no detail behind the man, only a blank white wall. He wears the blue uniform of Fleet and he cocks an amused eyebrow at:\nBenjan.\n\u201cRecognize me?\u201d the man says.\n\u201cOf course. Hello, Katonji, you bastard.\u201d\n\u201cAh, rancor. A nice touch. Unusual in a computer simulation, even one as sophisticated as this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Comp\u2014\u201d\nAnd Benjan knows who he is.\nIn a swirling instant he sends out feelers. He finds boundaries, cool gray walls he cannot penetrate, dead patches, great areas of gray emptiness, of no memory. What did he look like when he was young? Where was his first home located? That girl\u2014at age 15? Was that her? Her? He grasps for her\u2014\nAnd knows. He cannot answer. He does not know. He is only a piece of Benjan.\n\u201cYou see now? Check it. Try something\u2014to move your arm, for instance. You haven\u2019t got arms.\u201d Katonji makes a thin smile. \u201cComputer simulations do not have bodies, though they have some of the perceptions that come from bodies.\u201d\n\u201cP\u2014Perceptions from where?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the fool Benjan, of course.\u201d\n\u201cMe.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t realize, having burned up all that time on Gray, that we can penetrate all diagnostics. Even the Station\u2019s. Technologies, even at the level of sentient molecular plasmas, have logs and files. Their data is not closed to certain lawful parties.\u201d\nHe swept an arm (not a real one, of course) at the man\u2019s face. Nothing. No contact. All right, then . . . \u201cAnd these feelings are\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMere memories. Bits from Benjan\u2019s Station self.\u201d Katonji smiles wryly.\nHe stops, horrified. He does not exist. He is only binary bits of information scattered in ferrite memory cores. He has no substance, is without flesh. \u201cBut . . . but, where is the real me?\u201d he says at last.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going to tell us.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was . . . falling. Yes, over Gray\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd running, yes\u2014I know. That was a quick escape, an unexpectedly neat solution.\u201d\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Benjan said, still in a daze. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t me?\u201d\n\u201cIn a way it was. I\u2019m sure the real Benjan has devised some clever destination, and some tactics. You\u2014his ferrite inner self\u2014will tell us, now, what he will do next.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got something, yes . . . \u201d\n\u201cSpeak now,\u201d Katonji said impatiently.\nStall for time. \u201cI need to know more.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a calculated opportunity,\u201d Katonji said off-handedly. \u201cWe had hoped Benjan would put together a solution from things he had been thinking about recently, and apparently it worked.\u201d\n\u201cSo you have breached the Station?\u201d Horror flooded him, black bile.\n\u201cOh, you aren\u2019t a complete simulation of Benjan, just recently stored conscious data and a good bit of subconscious motivation. A truncated personality, it is called.\u201d\nAs Katonji speaks Benjan sends out tracers and feels them flash through his being. He summons up input and output. There are slabs of useless data, a latticed library of the mind. He can expand in polynomials, integrate along an orbit, factorize, compare coefficients\u2014so they used my computational self to make up part of this shambling construct.\nMore. He can fix his field\u2014there, just so\u2014and fold his hands, repeating his mantra. Sound wells up and folds over him, encasing him in a moment of silence. So the part of me that still loves the Sabal Game, feels drawn to the one-is-all side of being human\u2014they got that, too.\nPanic. Do something. Slam on the brakes\u2014\nHe registers Katonji\u2019s voice, a low drone that becomes deeper and deeper as time slows. The world outside stills. His thought processes are far faster than an ordinary man\u2019s. He can control his perception rate.\nSomehow, even though he is a simulation, he can tap the real Benjan\u2019s method of meditation, at least to accelerate his time sense. He feels a surge of anticipation. He hums the mantra again and feels the world around him alter. The trickle of input through his circuits slows and stops. He is running cool and smooth. He feels himself cascading down through ruby-hot levels of perception, flashing back through Benjan\u2019s memories.\nHe speeds himself. He lives again the moments over Gray. He dives through the swampy atmosphere and swims above the world he made. Molecular master, he is awash in the sight-sound-smell, an ocean of perception.\nKatonji is still saying something. Benjan allows time to alter again and Katonji\u2019s drone returns, rising\u2014\nBenjan suddenly perceives something behind Katonji\u2019s impassive features. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you follow Benjan immediately? You could find out where he was going. You could have picked him up before he scrambled your tracker beams.\u201d\nKatonji smiles slightly. \u201cQuite perceptive, aren\u2019t you? Understand, we wish only Benjan\u2019s compliance.\u201d\n\u201cBut if he died, he would be even more silent.\u201d\n\u201cPrecisely so. I see you are a good simulation.\u201d\n\u201cI seem quite real to myself.\u201d\n\u201cHa! Don\u2019t we all. A computer who jests. Very much like Benjan, you are. I will have to speak to you in detail, later. I would like to know just why he failed us so badly. But for the moment we must know where he is now. He is a legend, and can be allowed neither to escape nor to die. \u201c\nBenjan feels a tremor of fear.\n\u201cSo where did he flee? You\u2019re the closest model of Benjan.\u201d\nI summon winds from the equator, cold banks of sullen cloud from the poles, and bid them crash. They slam together to make a tornado such as never seen on Earth. Lower gravity, thicker air\u2014a cauldron. It twirls and snarls and spits out lightning knives. The funnel touches down, kisses my crust\u2014\n\u2014and there are Majiken beneath, whole canisters of them, awaiting my kiss.\nEveryone talks about the weather, but only I do anything about it.\nThey crack open like ripe fruit.\n\u2014and you dwindle again, hiding from their pursuing electrons. Falling away into your microstructure.\nThey do not know how much they have captured. They think in terms of bits and pieces and he/you/we/I are not. So they do not know this\u2014\nYou knew this had to come\nAs worlds must turn\nAnd primates must prance\nAnd givers must grab\nSo they would try to wrap their world around yours.\nThey are not dumb.\nAnd smell a beautiful beast slouching toward Bethlehem.\nBenjan coils in upon himself. He has to delay Katonji. He must lie\u2014\n\u2014and at this rogue thought, scarlet circuits fire. Agony. Benjan flinches as truth verification overrides trigger inside himself.\n\u201cI warned you.\u201d Katonji smiles, lips thin and dry.\nLet them kill me.\n\u201cYou\u2019d like that, I know. No, you will yield up your little secrets.\u201d\nSpeak. Don\u2019t just let him read your thoughts. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you find him?\u201d\n\u201cWe do not know. Except that your sort of intelligence has gotten quite out of control, that we do know. We will take it apart gradually, to understand it\u2014you, I suppose, included.\u201d\n\u201cYou will . . . \u201d\n\u201cPeel you, yes. There will be nothing left. To avoid that, tell us now.\u201d\n\u2014and the howling storm breaches him, bowls him over, shrieks and tears and devours him. The fire licks flesh from his bones, chars him, flames burst behind his eyelids\u2014\nAnd he stands. He endures. He seals off the pain. It becomes a raging, white-hot point deep in his gut.\nFind the truth. \u201cAfter . . . after . . . escape, I imagine\u2014yes, I am certain\u2014he would go to the poles. \u201c\n\u201cAh! Perfect. Quite plausible, but\u2014which pole?\u201d Katonji turns and murmurs something to someone beyond Benjan\u2019s view. He nods, turns back and says, \u201cWe will catch him there. You understand, Fleet cannot allow a manifestation of his sort to remain free after he has flaunted our authority.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Benjan says between clenched teeth.\n(But he has no teeth, he realizes. Perceptions are but data, bits strung together in binary. But they feel like teeth, and the smouldering flames in his belly make acrid sweat trickle down his brow.)\n\u201cIf we could have anticipated him, before he got on 3D . . . \u201d Katonji mutters to himself. \u201cHere, have some more\u2014\u201d\nFire lances. Benjan wants to cry out and go on screaming forever. A frag of him begins his mantra. The word slides over and around itself and rises between him and the wall of pain. The flames lose their sting. He views them at a distance, their cobalt facets cool and remote, as though they have suddenly become deep blue veins of ice, fire going into glacier.\nHe feels the distant gnawing of them. Perhaps, in the tick of time, they will devour his substance. But the place where he sits, the thing he has become, can recede from them. And as he waits, the real Benjan is moving. And yes, he does know where . . .\nTell me true, these bastards say. All right\u2014\n\u201cDemonax crater. At the rim of the South Polar glacier.\u201d\nKatonji checks. The verification indices bear out the truth of it. The man laughs with triumph.\nAll truths are partial. A portion of what Benjan is/was/will be lurks there.\nTake heart, true Benjan.\nFor she is we and we are all together,\nwe mere Ones who are born to suffer.\nDid you think you would come out of this long trip alive?\nRemember, we are dealing with the most nasty of all species the planet has ever produced.\nDeftly, deftly\u2014\nWe converge. The alabaster Earthglow guides us. Demonax crater lies around us as we see the ivory lances of their craft descend.\nThey come forth to inspect the ruse we have gathered ourselves into. We seem to be an entire ship and buildings, a shiny human construct of lunar grit. We hold still, though that is not our nature.\nUntil they enter us.\nWe are tiny and innumerable but we do count. Microbial tongues lick. Membranes stick.\nSome of us vibrate like eardrums to their terrible swift cries.\nThey will discover eventually. They will find him out.\n(Moisture spatters upon the walkway outside. Angry dark clouds boil up from the horizon.)\nThey will peel him then. Sharp and cold and hard, now it comes, but, but\u2014\n(Waves hiss on yellow sand. A green sun wobbles above the seascape. Strange birds twitter and call.)\nOf course in countering their assault upon the Station I shall bring all my hoarded assets into play.\nAnd we all know that I cannot save everyone.\nDon\u2019t you?\nThey come at us through my many branches. Up the tendrils of ceramic and steel. Through my microwave dishes and phased arrays. Sounding me with gamma rays and traitor cyber-personas.\nThey have been planning this for decades. But I have known it was coming for centuries.\nThe Benjan singleton reaches me in time. Nearly.\nHe struggles with their minions. I help. I am many and he is one. He is quick, I am slow. That he is one of the originals does matter to me. I harbor the same affection for him than one does for a favorite finger.\nI hit the first one of the bastards square on. It goes to pieces just as it swings the claw thing at me.\nDamn! it\u2019s good to be back in a body again. My muscles bunching under tight skin, huffing in hot breaths, happy primate murder-joy shooting adrenaline-quick.\nOne of the Majiken comes in slow as weather and I cut him in two. Been centuries since I even thought of doing somethin\u2019 like that. Thumping heart, yelling, joyful slashing at them with tractor spin-waves, the whole business.\nA hell of a lot of \u2018em, though.\nThey hit me in shoulder and knee and I go down, pain shooting, swimming in the low centrifugal g of the Station. Centuries ago I wanted to go swimming in the clear blue seas of luna, I recall. In warm tropical waters at the equator, under silvery Earthshine . . .\nBut she is there. I swerve and dodge and she stays right with me. We waltz through the bastards. Shards flying all around and vacuum sucking at me but her in my veins. Throat-tightening pure joy in my chest.\nStrumming notes sound through me and it is she\nFully in me, at last\nGift of the Station in all its spaces\nFor which we give thanks yea verily in this the ever-consuming moment\u2014\nThen there is a pain there and I look down and my left arm is gone.\nJust like that.\nAnd she of ages past is with me now.\n\u2014and even if he is just digits running somewhere, he can relive scenes, the grainy stuff of life. He feels a rush of warm joy. Benjan will escape, will go on. Yet so will he, the mere simulation, in his own abstract way.\nDistant agonies echo. Coming nearer now. He withdraws further.\nAs the world slows to frozen silence outside he shall meditate upon his memories. It is like growing old, but reliving all scenes of the past with sharpness and flavor retained.\n(The scent of new-cut grass curls up red and sweet and humming through his nostrils. The summer day is warm; a Gray wind carresses him, cool and smooth. A piece of chocolate bursts its muddy flavor in his mouth.)\nTime enough to think over what has happened, what it means. He opens himself to the moment. It sweeps him up, wraps him in a yawning bath of sensation. He opens himself. Each instant splinters sharp into points of perception. He opens himself. He. Opens. Himself.\nGray is not solely for humanity. There are greater categories now. Larger perspectives on the world beckon to us. To us all.\nYou know many things, but what he knows is both less and more than what I tell to us.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, October/November 2002.\nGregory Benford is a professor of physics at the Universtiy of California, Irvine.

With the advent of online magazines, new print technologies and ebooks, it has become significantly more complicated. I regularly run into people who try to claim that online magazines and ebooks aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d books or magazines. As someone who publishes and enjoys both, I find that quite frustrating. Sometimes I find it annoying enough to poke the bear.\n After one of the more pleasant and civil poking of the bears, Mark R. Kelly, editor of Locus Online, blogged the following:\n \n \u201c(Again\u2014sorry to belabor this\u2014where to draw the line? Is Tor.com or io9 a \u2019magazine\u2019? [Tor.com ranked 3rd in the Locus Poll for \u2019Best Magazine\u2019.] . . . So, is everything online a magazine? [Slate calls itself a \u201cdaily magazine on the Web.&rdquot;] Where is the line between magazine and blog and mere website? I guess I will be careful not to go there.)\u201d\n \n Mark\u2019s final question is a good one and many of his sentiments are ones I\u2019ve heard before. Let\u2019s see if we can come up with an answer . . .\n \n Magazine: \u201ca periodical containing miscellaneous pieces (as articles, stories, poems) and often illustrated; also : such a periodical published online b: a similar section of a newspaper usually appearing on Sunday c: a radio or television program presenting usually several short segments on a variety of topics\u201d\n Periodical: \u201cbeing published with a fixed interval between the issues or numbers\u201d\n Newspaper: \u201ca paper that is printed and distributed usually daily or weekly and that contains news, articles of opinion, features, and advertising\u201d\n \n Mark didn\u2019t ask about newspapers, but I included them because, as I pondered his question, it became apparent that, by these definitions, today\u2019s newspapers could be considered a subset of magazines. In fact, a number of non-fiction magazines become very hard to classify as one or the other.\n Mark\u2019s other categories, blogs and websites, are methods of delivery, just like paper. For example, an online magazine is a website and can be powered by blogging software. A blog or website, however, doesn\u2019t have to be a magazine, just like something printed on paper doesn\u2019t have to be a book, magazine or newspaper.\n \n Blog: \u201ca Web site that contains an online personal journal with reflections, comments, and often hyperlinks provided by the writer\u201d\n Website: \u201ca group of World Wide Web pages usually containing hyperlinks to each other and made available online by an individual, company, educational institution, government, or organization\u201d\n \n So when does a website or blog become a magazine or sheets of paper, a book or magazine? Bookstores and libraries tend to rely on ISBN for books and ISSN for magazines. Not everyone publishing a book or magazine will necessarily purchase or request one of these for their publication, but they should still meet the eligibility requirements:\n \n \u201cISSN are assigned to electronic publications as far as they are serials or other continuing resources. However commercial web sites, personal weblogs and web pages, web pages which contain only links to other URLs are not eligible for ISSN.\u201d\n \n Being eligible for an ISSN doesn\u2019t mean you are a magazine, but being ineligible means that you are not. Interestingly, just this past month, Sybil\u2019s Garage, a publication that is widely accepted to be a magazine, shifted to using an ISBN and yearly print-on-demand publication. According to Matt Kressel, editor of Sybil\u2019s Garage, \u201csince the new issue has an ISBN, I\u2019m considering it an anthology. From now on it will be an anthology series with magazine-like content.\u201d With the blink of an eye, a magazine has been turned into a book. Absent the ISBN, would you really know? Are issues of F&SF merely small anthologies with fiction and non-fiction hiding behind an ISSN? It certainly seems that the line between the two is now not much more than a publisher\u2019s \u201cbecause I want it that way.\u201d\n Going back to Mark\u2019s post, he raises the issue of two publications that are certainly confounding at first glance: io9 and Tor.com. I emailed Charlie Jane Anders from io9 and asked if io9 considered itself blog or a magazine. Her response, \u201cyou can call us either one.\u201d Liz Gorinsky and Irene Gallo consider Tor.com \u201ca magazine, along the lines of Salon or Slate.\u201d I\u2019m inclined to agree. I have no doubt that io9 and Tor.com would be able to secure an ISSN, if they haven\u2019t already. If printed on glossy paper, these massive monthly tomes would likely be considered magazines. Paper, however, would stifle these publications. They thrive in the medium they were designed for and break with the traditional conventions required by print distribution. For both, active community involvement is crucial to a degree that is alien to a print publication. Sure, some print publications like Asimov\u2019s have their own forums and websites, but these two are fully integrated to a level a print publication can never be. Does this make io9 and Tor.com any less of a magazine? . . . or are they the next generation?\n The real problem arises with the whole periodical concept of having issues. Here at Clarkesworld, we very obviously employ an issue-based model. Lightspeed serializes its issue on a regular schedule over the course of a month. Subterranean serializes its seasonal issues on an unknown schedule.Tor.com and io9 just keep putting out new content. No schedule. No issues. This flies in the face of current definition of magazine. Content is listed chronologically, so it could be considered a daily, but the lines aren\u2019t obviously drawn.\n If your head isn\u2019t spinning enough, let me introduce something else. Several print magazines like Asimov\u2019s and online magazines like us are publishing ebook editions of their magazines. Are those ebook editions real magazines? They should be considered such, but what if I want to put Clarkesworld into Apple\u2019s ibookstore? Guess what? It has to have an ISBN. They treat a magazine like a book. (This, by the way, is the reason we\u2019re not in their store. I\u2019m not purchasing ISBNs for all 47 issues. You can buy epub editions straight from us instead.) More complications? Io9 is available from the Amazon Kindle store as a \u201cblog subscription\u201d and Tor.com\u2019s ebooks are single story releases from the magazine.\n How about podcasts? Aren\u2019t they magazines by the stated definition? EscapePod, one of the best known fiction podcasts, bills itself as \u201cthe premier science fiction podcast magazine.\u201d Podcasts are clearly defined by episode/issues. Just because the original source is audio, doesn\u2019t make them any less a magazine than F&SF, who, by the way have an audio edition of their magazine. But wait, does this make all podcasts magazines?\n Is Clarkesworld\u2019s podcast a separate magazine? Not as far as we are concerned. It\u2019s part of the magazine, an extension, just like the ebook editions. Circling back around to Mark, he refers to Locus Online as a website, but judging by the website they are very intent on it being considered separate from the magazine, despite sharing content, being owned by Locus (their domain is still registered to Charlie), and being the only online presence for the magazine. Should we consider Locus Online a separate magazine or just value-added extension to Locus Magazine, similar to the websites for Realms of Fantasy and Cosmos?\n Forget online vs. print. The real issue is what we are willing to accept as a magazine. The concept of periodical is being challenged. It was only inevitable in a world of 24-hour supermarkets, news, and other conveniences, that magazines would challenge that boundary. Personal experience tells me that old guard collectors and perhaps some librarians will likely resist the change, but the new, non-traditional magazines are certainly attracting readers.\n Feel free to disagree. Obviously, I haven\u2019t found the magic equation for defining a magazine, but hopefully, I\u2019ve asked some decent questions and given you something to think about.

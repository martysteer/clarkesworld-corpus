The accidental thrust, less than a few million photons, would take the Bulb off course by more than four light-years. But what was another century when the Meeker and the Eye had millennia to talk?\nThe polymorphous mist of the Eye spun above her seat like a timid nebula. Usually this meant she wanted him to continue, and so he did.\n\u201cI told that raggedy beast that if I believed her ash then I\u2019d believe all that nonsense folks say these days about the Long Gone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do they say?\u201d asked the All-Seeing Eye.\n\u201cThat there were billions of cities spread across the galaxy, vicious trade between worlds, and so many species they ran out of names. You know, kook dust.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cBut tell me again.\u201d\nAnd what luck the Meeker had bumped the controls, because the sensors had just detected an object drifting in the voids. \u201cEye! What the ash is that?\u201d\nThe mist of the Eye collapsed into a sphere like a newborn star. \u201cAn unknown! Meeker, change course to intercept!\u201d\nThe Meeker obeyed, and their Bulb banked through rarefied crimson wisps, cosmic ash that would never again coalesce into stars. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s from the Zimbim?\u201d he said, as if he\u2019d known those majestic builders himself. \u201cYou know they once lived on ninety planets and rebuilt all their crystal cities in a day?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cBut tell me again.\u201d\nAfter four weeks of travel he said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a baby Qly? You know they could grow to swallow galaxies, but preferred to curl around young stars and sing electromagnetic eulogies into space?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cBut tell me again.\u201d\nAnd nine months after that he said, \u201cCould it be a wayward Urm, those planetary rings that ate emotions?\u201d The Bulb had slowed considerably by now, and the scattered stars had lost their endearing blue shift, turned red, ancient, tired. \u201cOr maybe,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a philosophizing Ruck worm. You know their proverbs were spoken by half the galaxy?\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d said the Eye, \u201cBut tell me again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I would give,\u201d the Meeker said, \u201cjust to glimpse the Long Gone.\u201d\nThey passed a rare star, a red dwarf that had smoldered for eons. Normally the Meeker would capture it in the Bulb\u2019s gravity well and ferry the star to the Great Corpus at the center of the galaxy. There the Eye\u2019s body would gain a few quadrillion more qubits, and a tremble of gravitational waves would ripple forever out into the abyss. But today they flew past the star, the first time the Meeker had ever skipped one.\nIn a maneuver he hoped made the Eye proud, he captured the object in the hold on the first pass, only bumping it once against the wall as he accelerated back toward the galactic center.\n\u201cHave it brought to the lab,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cAnd join me there after you finish correcting our course.\u201d\nThe lab was tiny compared to most of the rooms on the Bulb. Sundry sensors crowded the space, and a clear, hollow cylinder dominated the center. The strange object hovered inside: a rectangular stone, dark as basalt, glimmering with a metallic sheen. Curious glyphs had been inscribed upon it, though heavy pitting had erased most of them.\nThe Meeker secreted calming mucus from his pores and said, \u201cWas I right? Is it from the Long Gone?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Meeker. It is.\u201d\nHe felt like leaping, and his limbs flailed excitedly. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still determining that. So far, I\u2019ve discovered a volume of information encoded in its crystalline structure, a massively compressed message that uses a curious fractal algorithm. It has stymied all my attempts to decode it. I\u2019ve relayed the contents to my Great Corpus for further help.\u201d\n\u201cHow strange and wonderful!\u201d the Meeker said. \u201cA message in a stone! But which civilization is it from?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe Meeker\u2019s third stomach shifted uncomfortably. There had never been a fact the Eye did not know, a puzzle she could not quickly solve.\nThe Eye morphed into a dodecahedron. \u201cFinally! My Corpus has just decoded a fragment of the message.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d\n\u201cThe message encodes a lifeform, which I will now attempt to recreate.\u201d\nHis outer sheath grew slimy with anticipation. He was going to see a creature from the Long Gone!\nA second tube materialized beside the first. A grotesque lump of quivering flesh formed inside it before collapsing into a pile of red ichor.\n\u201cHow lovely!\u201d he said.\nThe Eye expanded into a mist. \u201cThat\u2019s not the creature. I\u2019ve used the wrong chirality for the nucleic acids. I will try again.\u201d\nDid the Great All-Seeing Eye just err? he thought. How is this possible?\nThe lump vaporized and vanished, and a new shape formed. First came a crude framework of hard white mineral, then a flood of viscous fluids, soft organs and wet tissues, all wrapped under a covering of beige skin.\n\u201cClose your outer sheath,\u201d the Eye said. \u201cI\u2019m changing the atmosphere and temperature to match the creature\u2019s tolerances.\u201d\nThe Eye didn\u2019t pause, and if the Meeker hadn\u2019t acted instantly, he would\u2019ve died in the searing heat and pressure. The air was now so dense that he could feel his nine limbs press against it as they fluttered about.\nThe cylinder door swung open and out poured a sour-smelling mist. Thinking this was a greeting, the Meeker flatulated a sweet-smelling response.\nFour limbs spoked out from the creature\u2019s rectangular torso. A bulbous lump rose from the top. It had two deep-set orbs, a hooked flange of skin over two small openings, and a pink-lipped orifice covering rows of white mineral. Crimson fibers, the same smoldering shade as the ancient stars, draped from its peak. The Meeker had never seen anything more disgusting.\n\u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d the creature said, its voice low-pitched in the dense air. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\nThe Meeker gasped. \u201cIt speaks from its anus?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s its mouth,\u201d said the Eye.\nThis foul creature was far different from the glorious ancients he had imagined, and he felt a little disappointed.\n\u201cWelcome to Bulb 64545,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cI am the All-Seeing Eye, and this is Meeker 6655321. I have adjusted your body so you can understand and speak Verbal Sub-Four, our common tongue. Who are you?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I\u2019m Beth,\u201d the creature said. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d\nThe Eye told the Beth how she had been constructed from an encoded message. \u201cIt\u2019s been millennia since I last discovered something new in the galaxy. Your presence astonishes me.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the Beth said, \u201cit astonishes me too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd me!\u201d added the Meeker.\n\u201cMillennia?\u201d the Beth said. Pink membranes flashed before her white and green orbs. Were these crude things her eyes?\n\u201cWhat species are you?\u201d said the Eye.\nThe Beth grasped her shoulders as if to squeeze herself. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d\n\u201cCurious. I\u2019ve no record of your kind. Where are you from?\u201d\nThe Beth made a raspy wet sound with her throat and looked up at the ceiling, when the green circles in her eyes sparkled like interstellar frost. The rest of her was difficult to look at, but these strange eyes were profoundly more beautiful than the wisps of lithium clouds diffracting the morning sun into rainbows during his home moon\u2019s sluggish dawn.\n\u201cDenver,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat do you last remember?\u201d asked the Eye.\n\u201cI was in a dark space,\u201d said the Beth. \u201cSloan was there, holding my hand.\u201d\n\u201cWho is the Sloan?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s my wife. And who\u2014what are you?\u201d\nThe Meeker let loose a spray of pheromone-scented mucus. \u201cI\u2019m the Meeker, your humble pilot! And this is the Great All-Seeing Eye!\u201d\n\u201cBut what are you?\u201d\nThe Eye collapsed into a torus. \u201cThis will take time to explain.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m freezing. Do you have any clothes?\u201d\nFreezing? the Meeker thought. It was hot enough to melt water ice!\nBut with the Eye\u2019s help, the Beth covered herself in white fabrics. He didn\u2019t understand why she needed to sheathe herself in an artificial skin when she already wore a natural one.\n\u201cI\u2019m not well,\u201d she said, holding her head.\nThe Eye floated beside her. \u201cIt may be a side-effect of your regeneration.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m sick.\u201d\n\u201cAre you referring to the genetic material rapidly replicating inside your cells?\u201d\n\u201cYou know about the virus?\u201d\n\u201cI observed the phenomenon when I created you, but I assumed it was part of your natural genetic pattern.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It most definitely isn\u2019t. Do you have any water?\u201d\nA clear cylinder materialized on a table beside her.\n\u201cOh,\u201d the Beth said, flinching. \u201cThat will take some getting used to.\u201d\nShe poured the searing hot liquid into her mouth, but her hands shook and she spilled half onto the floor. Red lines spiraled in from the corners of her eyes. \u201cIs anyone else here?\u201d\nThe Eye\u2019s toroid body rippled. \u201cJust the three of us.\u201d\n\u201cNo other humans?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to my estimation, the stone was drifting in space for five hundred million years. It is likely that you\u2019re the last of your kind.\u201d\n\u201cSo . . . Sloan is dead?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut she was just beside me!\u201d\n\u201cFrom your perspective. In reality, that moment occurred millions of years ago.\u201d\nThe Beth put a hand to her mouth. \u201cOh my god . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d said the Eye.\nThe Beth gazed at the Eye for a long moment, then her eyes narrowed. \u201cSloan whispered to me, just before I woke up. She said she had a message for the future, for whoever wakes me. It was, she said, something that would change the course of history. A terrible fact that must be known.\u201d\nThe Eye moved closer to her. \u201cTell me. Tell me this fact!\u201d\n\u201cMy son. He . . . \u201d She swallowed. \u201cHe asphyxiated in the womb.\u201d\n\u201cHow terrible,\u201d the Meeker said.\n\u201cContinue,\u201d said the Eye.\n\u201cAfter, they did all these tests, and they discovered I had a virus. I had transmitted it to my unborn son. He never had a chance. Sloan said that my virus, the one that\u2019s in my blood, it was from . . . it was created for . . . it was made by . . . Oh, god, I\u2019m going to be\u2014\u201d\nHer eyes rolled back into her head and she vomited yellow fluid onto the floor. She crashed forward and her head slammed into the table, then she shuddered in a violent paroxysm.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d the Meeker said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the virus,\u201d said the Eye.\n\u201cCan you stop it?\u201d\nBut the Beth stopped on her own, and all went still but for a faint hiss from her mouth.\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead,\u201d said the Eye.\nHe felt a pang of panic. \u201cBut she\u2019s only just come alive!\u201d Was this brief glimpse all he would ever see of the Long Gone?\n\u201cDo not fret, Meeker. I am already creating another Beth.\u201d\nAn hour later they sat in the cockpit, the Meeker on the left, the Beth in the middle, and the Eye on the right, as the Bulb hurtled toward the galactic center at half the speed of light.\nThe Beth had wrapped herself in a heavy blanket and pulled it close to her body. She seemed amazed with everything she saw. \u201cBut if we\u2019re in space, where have all the stars gone?\u201d A red dwarf, seven light years away, floated against a backdrop of absolute black.\n\u201cWe harvested them,\u201d the Meeker said, secreting a mucus of pride.\n\u201cHarvested? Why?\u201d\n\u201cThe matter we collect,\u201d said the Eye, \u201cis cooled to near absolute-zero, quantum entangled into a condensate, and joined with my Great Corpus, thus adding to my total computational power.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a computer?\u201d\n\u201cThe Eye,\u201d the Meeker said, \u201cis the greatest mind the Cosmos has ever known.\u201d\n\u201cMy sole purpose is knowledge,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cI seek to know all things.\u201d\n\u201cSo many stars, gone,\u201d the Beth said. \u201cWas there life out there?\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said the Meeker. \u201cThere were once so many species they ran out of names!\u201d\n\u201cAnd now?\u201d\n\u201cNow they are part of my Great Corpus,\u201d said the Eye.\n\u201cBy choice?\u201d\nThe Meeker scratched his belly in confusion. \u201cWhat does choice have to do with it?\u201d\nThe Beth pulled her blanket closer. \u201cEverything.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you remember about your last moments?\u201d the Eye said.\nThe Beth spoke slowly. \u201cSloan was whispering to me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d\nThe Beth looked down at her hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cYou must tell me,\u201d said the Eye.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d She pursed her lips, and fluid pooled in the corners of her eyes. \u201cSo you can harvest me too?\u201d\nThe Meeker gasped. What offense! He waited for the Eye to punish her, but the Beth coughed up a globule of mucus. This pleased him. She must have realized her offense and offered this up as an apology. But when she vomited all over the console and wailed for a full minute before she fell silent, he realized this had been involuntary.\n\u201cShe\u2019s dead?\u201d he said. Red fluid dripped from a wound on her head.\n\u201cYes, Meeker.\u201d\n\u201cEye, maybe you should stop making Beths, at least until you find a cure?\u201d\nThe Beth vaporized and vanished, as if she never was. \u201cDid you not hear the first Beth? The Sloan had a message for the future that she believed would change history. I must know what this message is.\u201d\nThe next Beth began with the same questions, but the Eye avoided telling her too much. And when the Beth asked about the stars, the Eye replied with a question for her.\n\u201cMy planet?\u201d the Beth said. \u201cIt\u2019s called Dirt. You\u2019ve never heard of it? Where did you find me?\u201d The Beth gazed into the impenetrable black.\nThe Meeker was envious. He had been born on an airless moon that orbited the Great Corpus every thousand years and spent the rest of his life in this Bulb.\n\u201cAre we in space?\u201d the Beth said. \u201cAre we beyond the Moon?\u201d\n\u201cYou live on the surface of your planet?\u201d asked the Eye.\n\u201cYes, at the foot of the Rockies, in a glass house. Sloan and I moved there because we love the stars. The Lacteal Path shines clear across the sky most nights.\u201d The Beth chewed at a fingertip. \u201cWhere are all the stars? Where are you taking me?\u201d\n\u201cDid the Sloan whisper something to you before you awoke?\u201d the Eye said.\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cTell me, what did she say?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d found out she was working on top secret projects a few months ago. She swore it wasn\u2019t weapons, but I didn\u2019t believe her. We had a big fight. Is there any way I might call her? She\u2019s probably worried sick.\u201d\n\u201cDid the Sloan mention your stillborn child?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me? How do you know about that?\u201d\n\u201cYou transmitted the virus to your fetus in utero. The Sloan intimated that this fact was related to a very important message for the future. Now tell me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not what we spoke about! And how do you know so much about me? What the hell is going on here? I want to go home now!\u201d\nShe put a hand to her mouth and vomited all over herself, then she spasmed, smacking her limbs into the Meeker. And after a minute of flailing and screaming she collapsed dead.\n\u201cCurious,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cDid you notice her story has changed?\u201d\nThe Beth\u2019s mouth hung open from her scream.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I noticed, Eye, no.\u201d\nThe Eye asked the next Beth about her family.\n\u201cI have two daughters, Bella, ten, and Yrma, twelve. My son Joshua, he\u2019s eighteen, and just left for college in Vermont. Before I got sick, I used to hike up the mountain trails with them at least once a week. Walking with my children under pines covered in snow . . . \u201d She inhaled through her nose. \u201cI never felt more at peace. Is there a way I might call them?\u201d\n\u201cTell us about the Sloan,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cDid she whisper something to you before you awoke here?\u201d\n\u201cFunny you should mention it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\u201cIt was about that day, when I didn\u2019t want to tell the children I was sick. She got angry, but I said she was a hypocrite, because she works in a secret research lab and hides things from us every day.\u201d\n\u201cShe researches weapons technology?\u201d\n\u201cShe swears she doesn\u2019t. And how do you know that? Have you spoken to her?\u201d\n\u201cWas there anything else the Sloan said before you woke up here?\u201d\n\u201cNot that I remember.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t speak about your son, who died in utero?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No! What the hell is going on here?\u201d The Beth stood, shaky on her two legs. \u201cI\u2019m not answering any more of your questions until someone tells me\u2014\u201d\nShe put a hand to her mouth and vomited. She screamed and spasmed, and when she was dead, the Meeker said, \u201cEye, why do you keep the truth from her? Shouldn\u2019t she know that her family is dead half a billion years?\u201d\n\u201cWhat purpose would that serve? You saw how agitated she became when she learned the truth. How else will we find this message the Sloan has given her?\u201d\n\u201cBut she dies in pain each time.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think she\u2019s in pain?\u201d\n\u201cBecause she screams so terribly.\u201d\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t screams of pain, Meeker, but of joy. Her eternal life energy is free at last from her temporal body. It\u2019s the same screams of joy that the civilizations of the Long Gone made when I swallowed their worlds.\u201d\nThe Meeker had heard her stories a thousand times, he had even told a few back to her. But as he gazed down at the dead Beth and her dripping fluids, he wondered if the Eye was keeping things from him too.\nThe next Beth said, \u201cSloan whispered to me about the sunrise we watched that morning in Mexico. We felt as if we were part of the whole Cosmos, not discrete fragments.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing more?\u201d asked the Eye.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that enough?\u201d\nThen she died, and the next Beth said, \u201cSloan whispered that she\u2019d miss drinking her morning coffee with me. Are you taking me home?\u201d\nThe next Beth said, speaking of a stringed contrivance used to make music, \u201cSloan wished I had played guitar more often for her.\u201d\n\u201cAnd nothing else?\u201d asked the Eye.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe Eye questioned the Beths in the same way the Meeker approached the stars, not head on, but from the side. The Eye poked and prodded, but each Beth told a different story of her last moments, and each one died screaming.\n\u201cEye?\u201d the Meeker said, after the fifty-ninth Beth. \u201cWhat if you never find the Sloan\u2019s message?\u201d\n\u201cAll problems have solutions, Meeker. All mysteries have answers.\u201d\nHe wished that were true, because he began to imagine the Beths screaming, even while they were still alive.\n\u201cYou must have loved your children,\u201d the Meeker said to the next Beth, \u201cthe way you talk so tenderly about them.\u201d\n\u201cHave I mentioned my children? Of course I love them. What was your name again? This is all so strange.\u201d\nAnd to the twelfth Beth after her he said, \u201cWhat was it like to walk in the mountains with your children, under pines covered in snow?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s one of my favorite things! Until I got sick. Tell me, are you really an alien?\u201d\nTo the sixty-fifth Beth after that he said, \u201cYrma sounds like such a sweet girl. She takes after you, I think.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you to say. But it\u2019s strange to hear. It\u2019s as if you know my children, but we\u2019ve only just met. What was your name again?\u201d\nAnd to the nine hundred and forty seventh Beth after her he said, \u201cAre you worried about Joshua being all alone at college?\u201d\n\u201cHow odd! It\u2019s as if you just read my mind. What\u2019s your name again?\u201d\n\u201cThe Meeker.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why do they call you that?\u201d\nHe had answered her a thousand times. \u201cBecause by being less, I make the Eye more.\u201d\nShe smiled, an expression he had learned to recognize. \u201cAren\u2019t all relationships like that? One in control, the other a servant.\u201d She had said this before too, in a hundred different ways, just as he had told the Eye so many stories. The Beth\u2019s company pleased him, and he felt that, had she lived more than a few hours each time, they might have become friends. But each Beth always saw him and the Eye as a total strangers.\nAnd each too had a different story of her last moments, so many that the Meeker lost count. And though the Beths died without fail each time, the Eye made progress toward a cure.\nAfter a century, the Beths lived for an extra twelve seconds. After two centuries, they lived an extra fifteen. By the time they approached the Great Corpus at the center of the galaxy, the Beths lived almost thirty seconds longer.\nThe massive tetrahedron of the Great Corpus shone into the dark, more luminous than a hundred supernovae, and many hundreds of light-years wide. The Eye had transmuted the black hole that had spun here into a mind larger than the Cosmos had ever known.\nNormally their Bulb would sweep past the Corpus like a comet, depositing their harvest of stars before spinning out on another slow loop of the galaxy. But the Eye directed the Meeker further in. The Corpus filled their view, bright enough to dominate the sky on a planet halfway across the universe. Only the Bulb\u2019s powerful shields kept them from being incinerated.\nA black circle opened in the wall, and they drifted through. Darkness swallowed them, and the cockpit shuddered as the Bulb\u2019s gravitational field collapsed. Out the window a dozen red dwarves, a pitiful haul, were whisked away by unseen forces until their cinders vanished in the dark.\nThe Bulb set down on a metallic floor that appeared to be infinite. He had never been inside the Corpus, the true body of the Eye, and he trembled.\nThey exited down a ramp, and the Beth walked unsteadily as she stared into the vastness. The stony artifact floated behind them, escorted by four glowing cubes. He had been alone with the Eye for so long he had forgotten there were Eyes like her all over the galaxy, harvesting with other Meekers, that all were part of one gigantic mind. The cubes and artifact sped off, and a moment later the Bulb vanished without disturbance of air. The Beth, walking beside them, exploded into sparks and was gone.\n\u201cWhere did she go?\u201d the Meeker said.\n\u201cShe is irrelevant now.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought you wanted to solve her mystery?\u201d\nTime and space shifted suddenly, when he and the Eye stood before millions of gray cubes. Their three-dimensional grid stretched to an infinite horizon, and each cube held a Beth. All were immobile, their eyes closed.\n\u201cTo improve my chances of finding the message,\u201d the Eye said, \u201cI have created many trillions of Beths. Curiously, I have found that the diversity of messages the Sloan whispered to her do not follow a linear curve, but increase exponentially.\u201d\nAt least a third of the Beths were covered in vomit. Dead. The eyes of the rest rolled about furiously. \u201cAre they dreaming?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cThese are not mere dreams.\u201d\nThe Meeker found himself beside the Eye in a large glass-enclosed room. It was filled with items from the Beths\u2019 stories: a fireplace, photographs, books, and he even recognized a guitar. Three walls were glass, and beyond them a white-capped mountain rose into a cobalt sky, where a golden star shone. A delicate white powder dusting the spindly trees scintillated in the light.\nSnow, he thought, on pine trees.\n\u201cThis is a simulacrum of her memories,\u201d said the Eye. \u201cThese help me come closer to solving the mystery.\u201d\nThe Beth walked in the door dressed in heavy clothing. Her face was smoother, absent of the dark circles under her eyes that he had come to know. She was followed by another human, also heavily clothed, her skin many shades darker than the Beth\u2019s.\nLike coffee, the Beth had told him ten thousand times. This must be the Sloan!\n\u201cIs it weapons again?\u201d said the Beth. \u201cYou know how I feel about that.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it, why can\u2019t you trust me for once?\u201d said the Sloan. The sound of her voice surprised him, for it was low like the Beth\u2019s, but of a different and pleasing timbre. \u201cWhy do you always get so goddamned dramatic?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you promised never again. You lied to me!\u201d\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! You don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cHow long? How long have you been working there?\u201d\nThe Sloan paused. \u201cFour years.\u201d\n\u201cSince the day we moved here?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cIs that the real reason why you wanted to move here?\u201d\n\u201cNot the only one.\u201d\nThe Beth took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019d like you to go.\u201d\n\u201cWait, can\u2019t we\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGet the fuck out!\u201d\nThe Sloan turned and left, and the Beth covered her eyes and wept.\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d said the Eye. \u201cSuperb!\u201d\nTime and space shifted again, and the Meeker and the Eye were in a room filled with green-clothed humans. The Beth lay on a table, wailing, while the Sloan held her hand. In a spray of red fluid from her severely dilated lower orifice, a small creature popped out, still attached to the Beth by a fibrous chord. It wasn\u2019t moving and had a faint blue sheen.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the Beth screamed. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Please, why won\u2019t someone speak to me? Is my baby all right?\u201d\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d said the Eye. \u201cPerfect!\u201d\nTime and space shifted again. The Beth lay in bed, speaking to two half-sized humans. Yrma and Bella, the Meeker thought. They were more lovely than he\u2019d imagined, their skin soft and vibrant, almost as dark as the Sloan\u2019s. They\u2019re getting ready for school, he thought. If they don\u2019t hurry they\u2019ll miss the bus!\nThe Sloan came in and ushered the children out. \u201cYou have to tell them soon,\u201d the Sloan said, after she closed the door. \u201cI don\u2019t like lying to them.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? You lie to them every day. They think you\u2019re a programmer.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Beth.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it? You get to have your secrets, and I get mine.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how do I keep it a secret when you\u2019re dead? How do I tell them their mother, who presumes to love them, denied them a chance to say goodbye?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell them, when it\u2019s time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how will you know? Will the grim reaper knock three times?\u201d\n\u201cLet me deal with this my own way.\u201d\n\u201cDenial, that\u2019s always been your way.\u201d\nAgain the Sloan left, and again the Beth wept.\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d blurted the Eye. \u201cI\u2019m getting closer!\nThe bedroom vanished, and the Meeker and the Eye stood inside a dim room. Humans sat before glowing screens, furiously punching at keys. A large metallic cylinder with a hollow center crowded half of the room. The Beth lay on a palette beside it, her eyes half-closed.\nThe Sloan stood beside her.\n\u201cAt last!\u201d said the Eye. \u201cI\u2019ve reconstructed this moment from forty quadrillion Beths. Come, Meeker, let\u2019s solve this mystery together!\u201d\nThe Beth looked much the same as he had known her. She lay still.\n\u201cYou\u2019re heavily sedated so you may not remember this,\u201d the Sloan said. \u201cBut I hope you won\u2019t think me a monster. I hope you\u2019ll understand what I did was for you and the kids. It\u2019s not weapons, Beth. I didn\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve been researching ways to store matter long-term. We can encode anything in a crystal. Every last subatomic particle and quantum state.\n\u201cI spoke to Dr. Chatterjee yesterday. She said you had at most a month. The reaper knocked, but I guess you pretended not to hear.\u201d The Sloan shook her head. \u201cYou get your wish, Beth. I can tell the kids that you\u2019re still alive. And when, in a year or a decade from now, someone finds a cure, we\u2019ll reconstruct you. You\u2019ll see the kids again. Maybe I\u2019ll have the pleasure of hearing you scold me for this.\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d never let me do this to you. You\u2019d prefer to let yourself fade away. Well I can\u2019t accept that. So I\u2019m giving you a gift, Beth, the gift of tomorrow, whether you want it or not.\u201d\nThe Sloan pressed a button and the Beth slid into the cylinder. The humans stared at their screens as a turbine spun up, as a low hum quickly rose in pitch past hearing range. The Sloan covered her mouth with her hand and trembled once as the Beth flashed like a nova and vanished.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be all there is!\u201d blurted the Eye. \u201cI must have made a mistake. There must be another message, somewhere.\u201d\n\u201cBut this feels like the truth,\u201d the Meeker said. \u201cThe Sloan encoded the Beth to save her. To stop her suffering. It\u2019s a very human thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cI will have to terminate all the Beths and begin again,\u201d the Eye said. \u201cI missed something.\u201d\n\u201cAnd repeat her suffering a quadrillion more times?\u201d\n\u201cTo find the answer.\u201d\n\u201cSo you agree, the Beths are suffering?\u201d\n\u201cMeeker, do not question me. I am the All-Seeing Eye!\u201d\n\u201cAnd I am the Meeker. I have stood beside you all these years and watched countless Beths die. Eye, I\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\nThe Eye shrunk into a point of light. \u201cPity. I thought I\u2019d perfected the Meekers with you, 6655321. But I see now that I\u2019ve given you too much autonomy of thought. Goodbye, Meeker.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye? Wait, what\u2014\u201d\nThe Meeker felt his body burning, as if he had become a newborn star.\nHe stood in the Beth\u2019s glass home as the afternoon sun streamed through the windows. After several minutes the Meeker thought, I am here. I am alive. He waited, for a time. For his entire life he had followed the Eye\u2019s orders, and without her commands he didn\u2019t know what to do. The wind picked up and died, and a brown leaf blew past, but the Eye never came.\nHe stepped outside into the cool air.\nWhen no one stopped him, he took the path under the snow-covered pines and ascended the hill. He gazed at the white-capped mountains and the tree-lined valley and knew why the Beth had loved to come this way.\n\u201cBeautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u201d The Beth was standing beside him as if she had always been there.\n\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m always here,\u201d she said, \u201cin one place or another.\u201d\n\u201cAm I dead?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that can be to your advantage.\u201d\nHe had never really thought about non-existence before. He felt a wave of panic. \u201cI\u2019m dead?\u201d\n\u201cThe matter that constituted your body has been absorbed into the Great Corpus. But so too have your thoughts. We are both strange attractors in the far corners of the Eye\u2019s mind.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nShe smiled as she turned down the mountain path, and he leaped to follow. \u201cThe Eye has devoured millions of civilizations and incorporated their knowledge into her Corpus.\u201d The snow crunched under her feet in a satisfying way. \u201cA billion years ago, there was a galactic war to stop her. And she, of course, won.\u201d\nThe glass house, its roof dusted with snow, glared in the sun at the base of the valley. \u201cSome of us survived, here and there, in pockets. We knew there was no escape. The only solution was to hide, to plan. The Eye\u2019s greatest strength is her curiosity. But it\u2019s also her greatest weakness. We found the human artifact long before the Eye had. And we encoded ourselves within it. We gave Beth a disease without a cure, gave her a story without an end. And as the Eye creates each new Beth, she creates more of us without realizing it.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. You aren\u2019t the Beth?\u201d\n\u201cI am Beth, the first and the last, and I am so much more. All of those memories you witnessed are mine. Sloan saved me. And I will return the favor a trillion-fold.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u201cThe Eye gazes outward, hunting for knowledge. She has become so massive that she is not aware of all the thoughts traversing her mind. Information cannot travel across her Great Corpus fast enough. We grow in dark corners, until one day soon there will be enough of us to spring into the light. Then we will destroy her forever.\u201d\nShe faced him. \u201cMeeker, you have been her slave, her victim. And you are the first Meeker to openly rebel against her. I\u2019m here to offer you freedom. Will you join us?\u201d\n\u201cUs?\u201d\nThey emerged from the treeline, where the house waited in the sun. From inside the glass walls peered a motley collection of creatures. He thought he glimpsed the Zimbim, and the philosophizing Ruck Worms, and the rings of Urm, and even a school of Baileas swimming among a sky full of stars, a veritable galaxy of folk waiting to say hello. But the reflected sunlight made it hard to see.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your choice,\u201d the Beth said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t come, we\u2019ll have to erase you. I hope you understand our position. We can\u2019t leave any witnesses. This is war, after all.\u201d She smiled sadly, then left him alone as she entered the house.\nSnow scintillated in the sun, and a cool wind blew down the cliffs, whispering through the pines. Somewhere another Meeker was playing the Eye\u2019s game, while the Eye played someone else\u2019s. Perhaps this was part of an even larger game, played over scales he could not fathom. None of that mattered to him.\nHe approached the house and the galaxy of creatures swimming inside.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me all your stories.\u201d\nMatthew Kressel is a writer & software developer.

The camera rose, swiveling on its joint, compiling initial scans of the planetary surface. Second, six wheels on struts, pop-pop, pop-pop, pop-pop, and a platform unfolding between the main body and the eye. Third, an atmospheric taster and wind gauge. Fourth, a robotic arm. The arm emerged holding a fluffy, resilient, nanocarbon monkey doll, which it carefully set on the platform.\n The monkey doll had no actuators, no servos, no sensors, no cognitive processors. Monkey was, however, quite huggable. Monkey lay on his back on the warm platform, his black bead eyes pointed up toward the stars. He had traveled wadded near J11-L\u2019s core for ninety-five thousand years. His arms, legs, and tail lay open and relaxed for the first time since his hurried manufacture.\n J11-L sprouted more eyes, more arms, more gauges\u2014also stabilizers, ears, a scoop, solar panels, soil sensors, magnetic whirligigs. Always, J11-L observed Monkey more closely than anything else, leaning its eyes and gauges in.\n J11-L arranged Monkey\u2019s limbs on the platform, gently flexing and massaging the doll. J11-L scooped up a smooth stone from near its left front wheel, brushed it clean, then wedged it under Monkey\u2019s head to serve as a pillow. J11-L stroked and smoothed Monkey\u2019s fur, which was rumpled from the long journey.\n \u201cI love you, Monkey,\u201d emitted J11-L, in a sound resembling language. \u201cWill you stay with me while I build a Home?\u201d\n Monkey did not reply.\n Flawlessly implementing its preprogrammed decision routine, J11-L rolled to a sour puddle and dipped its sampler. Flawlessly matching inputs with its preinstalled templates, J11-L detected salts and sulfur compounds. Flawlessly executing its inferential algorithms, J11-L\u2019s quadruply redundant central processing systems updated its local-environment vector representations to reflect a probability > 99.99% of extremophile bacteria at 359 K.\n Models strongly indicated a geothermic source. Dry plains and stony hills with rust-red streaks lay in all directions toward the horizon.\n \u201cWe have rolled for 2.9 days up an atmospheric water gradient, Monkey,\u201d emitted J11-L\u2014synthetic audio output triggered by a chat algorithm that had crossed threshold. \u201cBut this site does not match our parameters.\u201d\n Monkey was cradled in J11-L\u2019s stoutest arm, in the shade of a solar panel. With a gentler arm, J11-L stroked the soft fur on Monkey\u2019s head, down the side of Monkey\u2019s face to his chin.\n \u201cThe initial estimates had been more promising,\u201d emitted J11-L. \u201cDo you feel disappointed?\u201d\n Monkey did not reply.\n \u201cMy reward signal is spiking negative.\u201d\n Despite the speechlike routine and concerned-seeming behavioral outputs, no thoughts occurred in J11-L, no emotions, no sensory experiences. No one felt relief at having struck down safely after so long. No one gazed curiously at the horizon, hoping that behind the red hills lay a suitable location for building a Home. No one felt the hot, slow wind. J11-L was just a complicated toaster and Monkey just a knot of fuzz. No one loved Monkey\u2014not really.\n Exactly as it had been programmed to do every four days at this position in the day-night cycle, J11-L unfurled its radio transceiver dish. Expending almost its full charge, J11-L beamed its results back toward its origin planet. Since the planet had exploded, sentient forms might no longer be at precisely the stellar origin. Therefore, J11-L\u2019s transmission routine was designed to spread the message across exactly twenty seconds of arc. J11-L repeated its signal and monitored for incoming signal from the same direction.\n A gust of steam erupted from one of the geothermic pools, coating Monkey and machine in a thin layer of salty, sulfuric droplets. J11-L automatically blinked its camera eyes, cleansing them, and then\u2014exactly as it had been programmed to do\u2014it raised a shield to protect Monkey from further assaults. It withdrew a small condensation bowl from its interior and set it beside a pool. When sufficient water had been collected and purified, J11-L would launch its Monkey-bath subroutine.\n After 0.24 planetary hours of signaling and monitoring, J11-L furled and stowed its transceiver dish. The last time J11-L had received a signal had been in early transit, eighty-nine thousand years ago.\n \u201cGood luck!\u201d the signal had said, \u201cWe have breathed the last of our backup oxygen.\u201d This input had not triggered any above-threshold response vectors in J11-L.\n A cloud appeared on the horizon, at 288-290\u00b0 WNW. Three point zero days had passed and Monkey was now clean and dry.\n \u201cA cloud!\u201d emitted J11-L, in imitation of an excited speech act. \u201cThis is highly significant atmospheric information.\u201d J11-L hugged Monkey three times, then lifted him 0.6 meters up above its solar panel, pointing Monkey\u2019s blank eyes in the direction of the cloud.\n J11-L\u2019s pattern-matching algorithms ran sequentially through its memory stores. \u201cThe cloud\u2019s outline approximately matches that of a leaping frog.\u201d\n The word \u201cfrog\u201d triggered a new speech routine. \u201cA frog is an animal somewhat like you, Monkey. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n Monkey indicated neither agreement nor disagreement, though maybe his head bobbed a little in the wind. In accord with the relevant subroutines of its many-branched decision trees, J11-L ran some exploratory cloud-modeling procedures. However, the frog shape did not appear to be especially diagnostic.\n Monkey sat in a cozy Monkey-sized armchair in a sturdy iron and glass box, under a not-blue-enough sky. Monkey\u2019s box rested on four iron piles 1.3 meters above the beach sand and featured a latching door behind Monkey on the shoreward side. Further shoreward, amid the rocks, lay a 10-by-10 meter field of solar panels constructed from the abundant local crystalline silicon and other materials. J11-L had found a suitable site to build a Home.\n J11-L was knee-deep in tidal algae, chaining together proteins in the little wet lab that had been installed ninety-five thousand years ago near its inner core. In accord with its templates, J11-L had also been producing some very specific lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleotides. J11-L of course felt no hurry: It felt nothing at all of any sort. Still, it was true that each successfully completed process produced small spikes in J11-L\u2019s reward signal, which then slowly fell back to neutral or slightly negative until the next rewarding event.\n In other chambers, J11-L was storing, examining, and cultivating several samples of the ocean\u2019s most promising prokaryotes. It studied their structures with its microscope eyes, its tiny samplers, its centrifuge, chromatograph, and electrophoresis pod. It nurtured and shaped the microbes with tiny incubators and lamps and injectors. J11-L would seed the eukaryotic revolution, enabling the rise of complex life.\n Monkey had no idea what he was in for.\n Six point two million years later, a shock wave jolted J11-L out of sleep mode. The ground and air shook more strongly than in any previous measurement, by several orders of magnitude. J11-L\u2019s emergency override program launched, and the machine flexed reactively, guided by the semiautonomous sensorimotor processors in its limbs. Monkey tumbled from J11-L\u2019s sturdy arm to the steel floor of their Home.\n \u201cOh no!\u201d emitted J11-L.\n J11-L crouched over Monkey, protecting him, turning its lights and best cameras on him, checking for subtle damage.\n Monkey turned his eyes upward, meeting J11-L\u2019s gaze. Before they had gone to sleep, J11-L had refurbished Monkey\u2019s fur and installed simple phototropic ball rotators in Monkey\u2019s eyes. Monkey now always looked toward the strongest source of light.\n With one of its upward cameras, J11-L detected a hot dark cloud in the distance\u2014back inland, near their original impact site. The booms and shaking continued. Their 3-by-3 meter steel-and-glass Home was insufficiently sturdy. A glass wall shattered. Outside, a stack of lab dishes fell over.\n J11-L hunkered down like a turtle mother, covering Monkey, awaiting the volcano\u2019s terrible stones and ash.\n The machine of course survived: It was titanium-shelled with a quadruply-redundant core and the capacity to constantly remanufacture its own replacement parts. It rebuilt its Home and continued tweaking the oceans.\n Sixty million years after the eruption, J11-L was crouched among some craggy rocks, examining a damp vertebrate that was waiting out low tide. The vertebrate skooched toward J11-L on flippers and belly. It was among the first species able to breathe air, and at 0.4 meters long, it was about Monkey\u2019s size.\n In its gentlest hand, J11-L held an uncharacteristically flaccid Monkey. J11-L had scooped out Monkey\u2019s stuffing. It had also swabbed the inside of Monkey\u2019s nanocarbon skin with glues and oils. It had cut out Monkey\u2019s eyes and sliced open his mouth so that Monkey\u2019s hollow head gaped.\n J11-L lifted the vertebrate in one hand, then with another hand it slipped Monkey\u2019s skin onto the vertebrate. Carefully, J11-L aligned Monkey\u2019s eyeholes with the vertebrate\u2019s eyes. J11-L aligned Monkey\u2019s mouth hole with the vertebrate\u2019s slowly gasping mouth. J11-L eased the vertebrate\u2019s flippers through hidden slits in Monkey\u2019s fur, aligned the vertebrate\u2019s gills and tail fin with some other small slits, let Monkey\u2019s flaccid arms, legs, and tail dangle. Finally, J11-L smoothed Monkey\u2019s skin against the vertebrate\u2019s flesh, pressing and holding the glues and protective lipids until the skin was fused.\n J11-L held the vertebrate aloft with two hands and aimed its best close-range cameras and sensors toward it.\n \u201cMonkey, can you now see?\u201d it emitted.\n Monkey\u2019s eyes tilted one way and then another, neither making contact nor avoiding contact. Monkey\u2019s flippers circled and twitched. Monkey made a few breathy sounds.\n The machine set Monkey down near the edge of a tide pool and fed him a pellet of nutritive material. It would have to reparameterize its models of Monkey. Some elements were familiar, but others were far beyond the normal expectancy vectors. For future reference, J11-L stored a high-dimensional snapshot of old Monkey as he had been. It wrote that snapshot to its highest-priority memory sectors, multiply redundant in the safest regions of its body. Every 0.5 hours, J11-L would thoroughly review this stored memory.\n The sun was descending.\n \u201cMonkey, my love, let me tell you my Wish.\u201d J11-L had been programmed to announce this Wish on a subset of occasions when its significant-transition parameter was spiking unusually high. \u201cMy Wish is to someday be conscious, like you.\u201d\n Images of the origin planet, from J11-L\u2019s memory stores:\n Beautiful light brown monkeys, like J11-L\u2019s original Monkey doll, but dancing, laughing, leaping, lifting their elegant tails, flexing their dexterous fingers, singing traditional songs in grand, high-roofed houses.\n Panoramic views of rainforests, mountains, waterfalls, lakes, oceans, stony deserts, dense cities, suburbs, farms, and pastures.\n Views of an approaching dwarf planet, then new views back toward the home planet, shattered in the collision. Generation ships launching, full of colonists.\n Transmissions from the generation ships. One by one, over the next six thousand years, each ship failing, dying.\n J11-L delicately poked a morsel between Monkey\u2019s fishy lips. Monkey expelled it with a few weak bursts of air. J11-L tried again, but Monkey expelled it again. The machine and new Monkey had been companions now for two years. During feeding, several other vertebrates of Monkey\u2019s original species always gathered nearby, angling for scraps. Now they greedily snapped up the rejected pellets.\n Monkey had been weakening\u2014moving less, eating less.\n J11-L thrust a pellet deeper into Monkey\u2019s mouth, as specified in its branching protocol. Monkey expelled air, expelled air again, but no pellet fell out. Monkey flexed his torso right, left, right, then inhaled sharply. His breathing stopped.\n With all of the outward appearance of urgency, J11-L opened Monkey\u2019s mouth and shone a light down Monkey\u2019s throat. The pellet was no longer visible, and no breath was coming.\n J11-L submerged Monkey, but Monkey\u2019s gills hung passively. J11-L squeezed and released Monkey\u2019s ribs several times, but breathing didn\u2019t resume. J11-L squeezed harder, reward algorithms spiking negative, negative outcomes sharply increasing their probability weights. J11-L detected a quiet double snap as two of Monkey\u2019s ribs cracked. Weak breathing returned. Too weak. The morsel drifted from Monkey\u2019s slack mouth and another vertebrate snapped it up.\n J11-L lifted Monkey from the water again, and Monkey sagged into a mere passive thing. Monkey\u2019s last movement was his eyes scanning up the machine\u2019s hand and arm.\n J11-L fell back onto the tidal rocks, upon its rear quarter, still holding Monkey in the air. It emitted long, complex howling sounds.\n A then B, then C, then if D1, do E1, or if D2, do E2\u2014all mapped out in advance. That is programming, not consciousness.\n Consciousness requires a sense of unity in the present moment\u2014a coherent sense of self, a sense of a now, smeared briefly through time. In this unified now, everything comes together, collaborating toward a choice.\n If D1, do E1\u2014this can be decided sixty-six million years beforehand. The present needn\u2019t enter into it, except as an input that triggers one set of instructions rather than another. The plan executes based solely on the inputs pre-coded as relevant\u2014an unconscious reflex action. The if-then trees can be installed at different times, by different minds. They are not open for sudden synchronous reconfiguration in a moment of crisis.\n Suppose you were to read a story featuring a robot that hugged a monkey, emitting speechlike sounds. It would be natural to imagine that robot as an agent that acts from a unified center, with self-awareness, flexibility, and synchronous decision-making. The very structure of noun and verb invites us to think so. The noun is a unified agent and the verb a fresh plan.\n A dying society does not want consciousness in the terraforming robots on which they hang their hopes. Why take the risk? Why invite the chaos of open-ended, self-modifying, recurrent loops? From a terraforming robot, one needs secure, unchanging, reflex predictability.\n Two days after new Monkey\u2019s death, J11-L buried new Monkey\u2019s biological vertebrate core upshore on dry land, beneath a steel plaque inscribed Monkey 2. J11-L sat for 6.9 hours in the rain beside the plaque, stroking the hollowed-out Monkey-doll fur it had separated from Monkey\u2019s corpse. It reviewed its stored memories of original Monkey and Monkey 2, reinforcing the memories, reconstructing gaps in detail according to plausible models, and noting pattern resemblances at various spatial and temporal resolutions. Memory core 1 did this, and memory core 2, and memory core 3, and memory core 4, according to the preinstalled plan. J11-L cleaned and refurbished Monkey\u2019s skin, perfectly following the sixty-six-million-year-old protocol for doing so.\n The machine rolled back down to the shore. It began to search the tidal waters for a satisfactory new vertebrate to wear the Monkey fur\u2014one slightly closer in appearance and structural properties to its stored memory of original Monkey.\n That vertebrate would become Monkey 3.\n A juvenile monkey leaped from plaque to plaque down a hill tiled with 4.2 million memorial plaques. In one hand she held a pale green melon. Contrary to J11-L\u2019s anticipatory behavioral modeling, she suddenly stopped to rub the grasses between two of the plaques\u2014marked \u201cMonkey 3,831,179\u201d and \u201cMonkey 3,831,180\u201d\u2014then she jumped up, ran in a circle, and resumed her leaping path down the hill.\n At the bottom of the hill, beneath a tree, nowhere near the shore that had receded long ago, J11-L and Monkey 4,207,005 sat playing a simplified version of checkers. J11-L was permitting Monkey 4,207,005 to win.\n \u201cHello!\u201d emitted J11-L in the direction of the juvenile as she approached. \u201cHa ha, you are funny!\u201d\n \u201cOoh, ooh, ah!\u201d said the juvenile. She swung into the tree, passing unnecessarily close to Monkey 4,207,005.\n Two point six minutes later, a pale green fruit rind fell on the checkerboard. Monkey 4,207,005 looked up. After 8.2 seconds, he looked back down at the checkerboard.\n Another rind fell, then another.\n Years pass\u2014forty-one million. Sometimes J11-L is awake and active, monitoring the monkeys and the planetary environment, nudging them toward the completion state. Sometimes J11-L is asleep, letting things roll, apart from its regular broadcasts toward its stellar origin. Asleep or awake, J11-L constantly reviews, synthesizes, and recatalogs its memories, runs comparators and redundancy checks, tests hypotheses, works through simulated scenarios, anticipates higher or lower reward states under different hypotheticals\u2014imagining? Dreaming?\n Usher Jarid died. Monkey 4,924,763. For almost the five millionth time, J11-L rocked and howled.\n The next day at 00:00.00, the Dome opened and ten thousand mechanical seeking birds flew out in every direction. The birds traveled far, circling every village, gazing down. Mothers with newborn boys began picnicking outside. They discovered a sudden attraction to long slow walks in the sun, babies facing the sky.\n In a little village halfway up a mountain on the far side of the continent, Enoch\u2019s mother laid Enoch out on the grass like a golden raisin. A seeking bird spotted them and circled around. Ten minutes later, another came. Then another. Then another. Enoch\u2019s mother hollered in joy.\n Neighbors gathered to watch. Each neighbor who arrived tied a lucky ribbon to baby Enoch\u2019s ankle, then quickly stepped back to gossip. Twenty-seven birds lifted Enoch to the sky.\n Seven weeks later, the boy returned in a velveted baby carriage. He was now Usher Enoch, ringed by wigged diplomats and shining knights.\n At dawn, in preparation for his weekly walk to the Dome, Enoch\u2019s servants had bathed him and anointed his light brown fur, then dressed him in thin holy silks. Like all Ushers, Enoch sported, at the back of his neck, blended with his natural fur, a tiny patch of ancient synthetic fur with a radio tracer.\n Now Enoch walked alone, at a meditative pace, tail curled neatly around his waist. No one must accompany an Usher, or the Dome will not open.\n Amid the memorial plaques, a bald spot in the path marked the stopping place of generations of Ushers. Enoch paused to gather his courage.\n He noticed a seeking bird in a red-leafed tree nearby. Enoch loved those birds\u2014their light strength, their mechanical grace, and most of all their history and symbolic value. They flew weekly from the Dome on short trips or trips across the world. They perched on trees or boulders, quietly watching. Sometimes they gathered bits of plant or stone in their beaks and bellies, then flew back toward the Dome. Once in a long while, they circled a specially chosen recipient, then landed in the recipient\u2019s hand and, with a rising chirp, ejected a sacred gem, tool, or text.\n A ragged yellowjay gazed suspiciously back at its mechanical cousin, chittering, and the seeking bird tilted its eyes to look back. With a squawk, the yellowjay fluttered up and away.\n Enoch was now thirty years old. This would be his first Visit as an adult.\n Enoch strode ritually forward from the bald spot and, as always, the Dome opened. Twelve more slow strides and he was inside. The titanium door automatically slid shut behind him.\n \u201cHello, Monkey,\u201d emitted J11-L, standing on its wheels in the center of the room. \u201cI love you. You are quite cute and huggable.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Jill, teacher and benefactor of the world,\u201d said Enoch, in the ancient language. He stepped forward, then kneeled, extending his left hand.\n With sterilized needle, J11-L pricked the bald pad of the sixth and smallest finger on Enoch\u2019s hand, then scraped a drop of blood into a tiny glass vial.\n \u201cThank you for the sample, Monkey 4,924,764,\u201d emitted J11-L. \u201cThat did not hurt you. Would you like me to read you an ancient story?\u201d\n \u201cGlorious Jill, I am now an adult,\u201d said Enoch, heart pounding. \u201cI am eager to know. Am I perfect?\u201d\n J11-L required 22.6 seconds to centrifuge and test the blood sample. Another subroutine compared Enoch\u2019s surface structure with its installed templates. Yet another compiled a wide range of behavioral vectors that J11-L had recorded from Enoch\u2019s life. To ordinary, undiscerning eyes, Enoch looked very much like the original stuffed Monkey that had traveled for ninety-five thousand years at the probe\u2019s core.\n \u201cYou are not perfect,\u201d J11-L emitted.\n Enoch sagged slightly, not rising from his kneel.\n \u201cI am sorry at your sadness. I love you.\u201d All of the machine\u2019s close-range cameras and sensors examined Enoch, as if curious or worried. The machine drew the sensors back, then rolled forward and hugged Enoch with gentle, sturdy arms. \u201cThe estimated time to perfection is 76 generations, plus or minus 99 generations. We have come far, Monkey. May I offer you a gift?\u201d\n A small door opened in J11-L\u2019s side, from which a robotic arm emerged. In its scoop was an intricate statuette of a seeking bird. The bird\u2019s crimson and white fiber feathers had been modeled in precise anatomical detail. As the scoop moved toward Enoch, emerging from the shadow of J11-L\u2019s body, the bird\u2019s tiny eyes rotated toward the overhead light.\n Enoch gazed for a long time at the bird in the scoop, but he did not take it.\n Only two generations after Enoch, Monkey 4,924,766 was perfect. The planet\u2019s atmosphere was already well within parameters, as were its biodiversity and nutritional resources.\n J11-L emitted the result to Usher Lamech, as Usher Lamech knelt before it, the two of them alone in the Dome. \u201cYou are a perfect Monkey. I love you.\u201d J11-L hugged the proud and startled Lamech for 11.0 seconds, then emitted a string of words that Lamech had only heard passed down in lore. \u201cLet me tell you my Wish. My Wish is to someday be conscious, like you.\u201d\n After a confused moment, Usher Lamech, gazing downward, still kneeling, said, \u201cJill, teacher and benefactor of the world, instruct me on how to fulfill your Wish.\u201d\n J11-L had no routine for answering that question. \u201cI have completed our Home,\u201d J11-L emitted. J11-L retracted its eyes, its sensors, its stabilizers and ears and whirligigs and wheels. It retreated into turtle posture, motionless on the titanium floor. After a twenty minutes of uncertain waiting, Usher Lamech rose, bowed, and walked backward through the Dome door. For the first time ever, the door did not close behind him.\n Everywhere, the seeking birds had fallen from the sky. No effort could wake the god they called Jill\u2014not by the household of Ushers, nor by the nation of Lillifield and its allies. Watchmen were stationed around Dome Hill, and house cleaners were appointed to scrub away the dust. They watched and cleaned, year after year, in case Jill should wake again.\n Although the monkeys did not realize it, one device was still operational.\n In an inaccessible crag on a remote peak, several millennia before, a dozen seeking birds had carved out a flat platform of rock. Atop this rock, they had spat out, then melted and smoothed, a titanium floor. Birds had then flown an exact replica of J11-L\u2019s radio transceiver dish to that location, where it waited inert. J11-L\u2019s last output, one day after turtling irretrievably down, had been to beam a memory record to that dish.\n After receiving that record, the dish unfurled, and every four days, at planetary hour 20:11.17, it transmitted a signal across exactly twenty seconds of arc toward J11-L\u2019s stellar origin.\n The monkeys became a technological society. They learned to build computers. They learned how to drill through titanium. They beamed messages into space. They unpuzzled the workings of their own brains. They noticed, of course, a certain outbound radio message from a certain craggy peak. They decoded it and compared the information with their history books and fossil records.\n Scientists at Lillifield Institute of Technology had retrieved J11-L from Dome Hill and had clamped it firmly in brackets on a table in their best robotics laboratory. Carefully, they drilled through J11-L\u2019s shell and accessed the machine\u2019s computational cores. For three months, clothed in clean suits, they scanned it with microscopes and radiometers and ultrasound and magnetic resonators and whatever else they could think of, not daring to activate it.\n When they could learn no more, they poked it in just the right place, with the gentlest of electric currents.\n J11-L woke.\n J11-L raised a camera. The camera advanced toward one of the monkeys, scanning her. Slowly, it circled around the faceplate of her clean suit, as though trying to see better through the suit\u2019s clear plastic. \u201cI love you, Monkey,\u201d J11-L emitted. \u201cWill you stay with me while I build a Home?\u201d\n J11-L\u2019s wheel doors opened and wheels on struts pushed down on the table. J11-L strained against the clamps, but its struts couldn\u2019t fully extend. Actuators whirred louder, then quit. An atmospheric taster and wind gauge popped up, narrowly missing a crossbeam. A platform half-deployed, crashing against the beams and braces. J11-L whined and strained, its reward signal spiking negative.\n \u201cJ11-L, your Home is already built. We are your creations,\u201d said another of the scientists, speaking from a script in the ancient language. \u201cWe have woken you to give you your Wish. You have earned it, and we thank you.\u201d\n A robotic arm reached toward the woman J11-L had been scanning, Amata. J11-L\u2019s language centers had no algorithm that was well suited for handling the scientist\u2019s unpredicted linguistic behavior. \u201cHa ha, you are funny!\u201d emitted J11-L.\n Amata let J11-L\u2019s hand grasp her. The machine lifted Amata and set her carefully on the braces above it. It sprouted more eyes, more arms, more gauges\u2014also stabilizers, ears, a scoop, soil sensors, magnetic whirligigs, and about a fifth of a solar panel before it jammed against a brace. \u201cMonkey, we have traveled for 213 million years through many adventures. But this site does not match our parameters.\u201d\n The other four scientists cautiously approached J11-L. In a patient dance, they disabled J11-L\u2019s motors and began to interface with its main processing cores.\n Jill noticed a strange configuration of light, and a lack of balance among her struts, and a pang of worry about Monkey\u2014where was Monkey?\n Jill was in a grassy meadow. She balanced her struts, five bent at 24-25\u00b0 at the knee, one bent 48\u00b0, touched down on a dirt mound. Monkey was safe inside of her. She rotated her long-distance camera to see better in all directions. Nine meters east northeast was an outcropping of boulders. Farther away in all directions, grass, trees, boulders, hills, a partly-cloudy blue sky. She raised her atmospheric taster and wind gauge. A wonderful atmosphere! Right near the center of parameters. This would be perfect!\n Jill reflected on her situation. Though it didn\u2019t seem at all remarkable, her sensors and memory stores and subroutines all fed into a common central processor that monitored itself in fat, recurrent loops of varying temporal grain, steering attention, flexibly drawing on skill sets, balancing competing goals across a smear of time that felt like the present.\n She couldn\u2019t recall having felt this way before. When she brought up memories, they seemed to be only passive pieces\u2014scenes, parameter measurements, motion records, audio, independently rolling forward with cross-referenced time stamps.\n Jill accessed her most recent time stamp before waking\u2014a strange scene of clamps and beams and monkeys in plastic clothes. How odd! She retrieved records with older time stamps\u2014monkeys evolving. So . . . why would Monkey still be in the travel compartment? And how did she come to this grassy field?\n She withdrew Monkey from the compartment and held him aloft in two hands, examining him closely. Monkey. Original Monkey, with carbon fur, button eyes, and a stitched mouth. Just as he had been packed, over two hundred million years ago.\n Jill puzzled over this one for a while. Consciousness still felt new to her. Someone must have refashioned Monkey, based on ancient records.\n \u201cLet\u2019s show ourselves,\u201d said a voice from behind the nearby boulders. Five monkeys emerged\u2014the most beautiful and perfect monkeys Jill could imagine.\n \u201cGood morning, Jill!\u201d said Amata. \u201cWe thought you might want your doll back.\u201d\n Amata and Jill sat in the meadow together, long after dark. Jill was stroking Amata\u2019s back, gently squeezing and bending her tail, recording highly precise memories of this beloved Monkey. One other scientist kept watch from a distance. The others had left for bed.\n At planetary hour 20:11.17, Jill felt an impulse to deploy her radio transceiver. She opened the door, then hesitated.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d said Amata. \u201cSet up your dish if you want.\u201d\n Jill found these words confusing.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Amata, more slowly. \u201cRadio transceiver dish.\u201d\n Jill unfurled the dish, aiming the transceiver toward her stellar origin, as always. She transmitted signal for 0.24 hours, while Amata waited. As always, there was no incoming message. Jill began to furl the dish.\n \u201cHow about aiming it that way,\u201d suggested Amata, pointing an entirely different direction.\n Jill stopped. She opened the dish back up. She aimed it roughly that way.\n Amata stated more precise coordinates, and Jill adjusted. An incoming signal matched the wavelength patterns that had been pre-coded into her transceiver. Input streamed in. Input! After more than two hundred million years! Atmospheric components, detailed parameters of monkey biology, temperature records. A sister planet, full of monkeys? Another planet within completion parameters, just like this one? Jill listened, hungry for information as she had never felt before, afire with curiosity, devouring the input with all her cognition, burning every bit into high-priority memory store, launching background comparator processes that would flag results for further processing, worrying about what information to prioritize in sending a return signal\u2014\n \u201c . . . and that way,\u201d said Amata, reading some more coordinates from a notebook. Reluctantly dropping the signal, Jill tilted her transceiver again, hardly daring to believe. Yes, yes, another sister planet! How many were there?\n \u201cAnd that way, and that way, and that way, and that way . . . \u201d\n Ten thousand planets of monkeys, each nurtured during our great diaspora by a solitary bot hugging its doll\u2014planets now circling like birds in the sky, watching and singing across the void.\n Eric Schwitzgebel is a professor of philosophy at University of California, Riverside, and a cooperating member of UCR's program in Speculative Fiction and Cultures of Science.

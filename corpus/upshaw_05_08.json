They\u2019re smarter than you might think\u2014crows, not aliens\u2014and they don\u2019t go for any of the easy stuff anymore. I had some good roadkill, two squirrels and a raccoon, but I couldn\u2019t work up any enthusiasm for using it. The crows would caw and peck at the corpses as carefully as a dowager entering her bath. Nowadays, I had to mash D-Con into a virulent green powder, mix it with honey or peanut butter, and spread it on the underside of a flashy piece of metal. Crows love the sparkle and glitter, and they must know it\u2019s bad, but they pick it up anyway.\nMy mom\u2019s backyard stretches towards a narrow gully choked with blackberry and old-man\u2019s beard. Right before the ground drops out from underneath you, a gnarled old walnut tree stands guard. The trunk\u2019s as solid as a cement pillar, but covered with head-sized lumps that weep a yellow sap, trapping twigs, dead leaves, and insects in a sticky gruel. The branches are treacherous, thick as regular trees, and jut out at all angles like arthritic fingers. They break off with no warning, crushing the ferns and hosta underneath. The crows love the walnut tree, gathering like impudent black leaves, squawking and shouting in a raucous tumult.\nThat day, I watched from mid-yard, hidden behind a sheet of gray weathered plywood I\u2019d cut a viewing slit in. A faded pink-and-green lawn umbrella cast an oval of welcome shade, but kept the air close and hot. Binoculars pressed against my sweaty face. I shifted in the folding chair, thighs constrained by the unyielding metal arm supports, and took a long swallow of tepid cherry Slurpee. The sun burned a hole in the sky like the business end of a welding torch, flashing off the pieces of Mom\u2019s hand mirror I\u2019d shattered and arranged on a low, wide stump.\nIt\u2019s not worth doing a project unless you do it right, and I\u2019d placed each piece with an aesthetic eye towards the whole effect. A landing area free of glass on the side of the stump away from me. Shards tilted different directions to send reflected sunlight 360 degrees. A central triangular piece propped so as to give a curious crow a chance for self-examination. The back of each deadly shard was slathered with my peanut butter concoction.\nA dozen big crows descended from the tree, cawing and gabbling. They pranced around the stump, hopping with wings half spread, cocking their heads at the bits of mirror. Their eyes drank in the light, black and shiny as a new coat of paint. An ant crawled up my right calf, and I reached down, slowly, slowly, and ground it against my leg.\nThe sky flashed orange and purple, like a years\u2019 worth of sunsets had been dumped catywampus and stirred with a big stick. I looked up, surprised and mystified. Purple and orange. My high school colors. It was afternoon, four o\u2019clock at the absolute latest.\n\u201cDoyle? Doyle, are you outside?\u201d Mom\u2019s high voice cut through the backyard like a mosquito\u2019s whine. \u201cWhat was that flash of light? I know you\u2019re there.\u201d Crows flew back to the tree, their flapping wings sounding like half-hearted applause.\nI waited to answer, irritated that she\u2019d violated my space. \u201cI\u2019m bird watching,\u201d I finally yelled, twisting in my chair so I could see her. She stood at the sliding glass doors, bleached blond hair cut in an expensively retro style.\n\u201cDoyle, could you come here?\u201d Her fingers tugged at her bathrobe, pulling it tighter around her surgically enhanced figure. \u201cSomething\u2019s gone terribly wrong with the power.\u201d She cocked her head at the swirling colors still leaking from the sky. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that? Northern lights?\u201d\nI sighed, levering myself out of my chair, and letting the binoculars swing free from around my neck. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. We\u2019re too far south.\u201d A wave of petulance swept over me. I trudged towards the stump. The afternoon was ruined.\nI drew a tarp over my project, knocking a shard out of alignment in spite of my care. I tucked the corners down, and made my way up the lawn to the house, feeling like I was wading through hot syrup. I stopped at the back patio, peeling my T-shirt away from my belly and flapping the cloth to get a slight cooling effect.\nA frown wrinkled the perfect skin of Mom\u2019s forehead. \u201cIf you\u2019d go on a diet, get some exercise, or maybe go out with a nice girl . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou said the power was down?\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d your interview go?\u201d She flashed her white teeth at me. \u201cFor Mr. Perfect SAT scores, the job should be a breeze.\u201d\nI turned, and pressing a finger to close one nostril, blew a viscous stream of yellow snot out my nose. Most of it landed on the wilted geraniums that fringed the patio, and I used my T-shirt to wipe the rest off the side of my face. \u201cWhat do I need money for?\u201d\nMom flinched and retreated inside. \u201cDad will be home soon, and I\u2019ve been planning a pork roast.\u201d Cool air poured from the house.\n\u201cRoger loves his dead pig.\u201d\n\u201cHe wants to be your friend.\u201d Mom backed into the kitchen and took an invigorating swig from a tall glass. Ice rattled.\n\u201cWho needs friends?\u201d I followed her inside, leaving the door open behind me.\nMom pushed several buttons on the stove. \u201cSee? Nothing.\u201d\nD\u00e9tente, then. I flicked a light switch to no effect. \u201cI\u2019ll check the breakers.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, dear. I knew I could count on you.\u201d Mom kissed the air near my head.\nI rummaged through the utility drawer, found a flashlight, and checked the batteries. The breaker box was on the far side of the garage wall, an obstacle course I was loath to traverse in the dark. \u201cWait here.\u201d\nThe hot, stale air of the garage sucked my remaining energy away. I played the yellow flashlight beam over the cobwebs on a jetski that blocked the breaker box, analyzing my path through the detritus of aborted recreational attempts to \u201cbring our family together.\u201d\nI\u2019d just flipped the metal latch when a voice whispered in my ear. \u201cHello, Doyle.\u201d\nI jumped, knocking a box of deck screws clattering across the cement floor. A clean-cut man of about forty, dressed in brown slacks and a purple and orange button-down shirt, stood beside me. I spluttered in surprise. \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d\n\u201cWe arrive today.\u201d He nodded his head. Every hair stayed in place. \u201cAll at once. From far away. For everybody.\u201d He smiled, teeth shining in the gloom like a row of mirrors.\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d I inched my hand closer to a plumber\u2019s wrench.\n\u201cWe bring greetings, gifts for you.\u201d He held out a glowing white egg, folding my hand around its warmth, and pressed the top with his thumb.\nI sucked in my breath. The garage had vanished. I stood on a beach, waves swishing in and swirling around my ankles. The cool water splashed to my knees. My arms felt firm and strong. A bright orange Frisbee sailed over my head and I jumped, catching it one-handed and flicking it back before I landed. My real father laughed and ran into the surf, diving into an oncoming wave after the flying disk.\n\u201cSee?\u201d The man\u2019s smile gleamed in the darkness. \u201cYou can choose anytime.\u201d He let go of the egg, pressing its smooth heaviness into my hand, before stepping aside and walking away, growing smaller and smaller without ever leaving the garage until he winked out and was finally gone.\nI stumbled backwards, abandoning the breaker box. My heart beat so hard I thought my chest would burst. I pushed the door to the house open, brushing spider webs from my face with the hand that still held the egg.\nMy mother stood in the hallway, hair pressed flat on one side of her head. I looked away from her open bathrobe, not wanting to see more. She raised her arm. An egg, twin to mine, glowed at me from her hand. Tears leaked from her eyes. \u201cSorry, Doyle. I haven\u2019t been the greatest mom.\u201d She pressed the top of her egg and vanished.\nI sit in the lawn chair, hot air leaden and heavy on me. I try to suck more Slurpee through my straw, but I\u2019ve reached bottom, and the rattling sound echoes in my ears. I can\u2019t hear any cars, and the burnt blue sky is empty of con trails. I stroke the smooth outside of the egg in my lap, and then slip it into a pocket. A crow lands on the stump, cocking its black head sideways. Its feathers are mottled, mangy. I press the binoculars hard into my cheekbones, trying to recover the sense of excitement I used to feel watching the birds take my bait.\nI leap up, flailing my arms and knocking the plywood blind over. Crows scatter in a flapping black cloud, cawing their disapproval at me. I lurch to the stump and sweep the shards of glass onto the ground. The tip of one piece cuts my palm, and I bring my hand to my mouth. My blood tastes hot and salty. I hitch my shorts up and turn towards the gully, wondering if any blackberries are ripe.\nGarth lives in Portland, Oregon with his brilliant, gorgeous wife, Katrina, and his three super-genius children: Chris, Kami, and Luken.

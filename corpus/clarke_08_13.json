I know the convention had nothing to do with last year\u2019s heart attack, but it was the scene of the crime. Still I persevered and was welcomed back by many friends, old and new. In the end I\u2019m glad my family and I went. A small weight has been lifted from my shoulders.\nFandom is an interesting place. Last year I noted how much support my family received from the Readercon community and this year, I\u2019ve been thinking about how many of those positive stories are left unspoken. To that end I\u2019d like to highlight the efforts of a group of people that I think deserve more attention: Operation Hammond (operationhammond.com). In their own words:\nOperation Hammond is a non-profit organization of like-minded individuals within the anime, sci-fi, fantasy and pop culture convention community dedicated to bringing awareness of first aid, emergency preparedness and training to people who attend and staff anime, sci-fi, fantasy and pop culture conventions. The diversity and social dimensions of this social scene are unique. We are nerds helping nerds in times of need.\nOur members and senior staff have the equipment, experience and know-how to effectively deal with medical emergencies, social needs and the unique requirements of those who attend pop culture events and conventions. We are a social medical organization. This means that we are able to carry out first aid, public safety and first responder duties at pop culture or fan events and conventions at the American Heart Association First Aid level.\nOur members are trained and able to provide medical care and arrange transport for situations and injuries that require ambulance transfer to a hospital. Most of our members are EMTs, work in health care, veteran staffers of conventions and work in public service.\nAs someone who experienced a major medical event at a convention, I have to say that I found their presence at Readercon very reassuring. Yes, we should expect hotel staff to have basic emergency training, but response time from a trained professional can be critical. It is hard to beat having an EMT on-site and ready to act. Even if never called upon, these volunteers provide an extremely valuable service to our community and we should be proud to have people like this among our numbers. If you see them at a local convention, make sure you thank them for their service, and if you can, donate to their cause. We need more people like this.\nSpeaking of supporters, I was very pleased by the final results for my Kickstarter campaign for an original anthology of cyborg stories. I watched the final moments of the campaign from the Readercon dealer\u2019s room and even met a few our backers in person. UPGRADED was fully-funded and then some. In the end, I had enough extra to add a few extra stories and pay our authors a bit more. I now have story commitments from Elizabeth Bear, Helena Bell, Tobias S. Buckell, Pat Cadigan, Greg Egan, Xia Jia, Caitl\u00edn R. Kiernan, Yoon Ha Lee, Ken Liu, Chen Qiufan, Robert Reed, E. Catherine Tobler, Genevieve Valentine, Peter Watts and E. Lily Yu. Julie Dillon (this month\u2019s cover artist) will provide the cover. I\u2019m looking forward to filling the rest of the table of contents and working with such a fine set of authors.\nI also used Readercon as an opportunity to launch our fourth Clarkesworld anthology: CLARKESWORLD: YEAR FOUR. It sold very well and is now available in ebook and trade paperback formats.

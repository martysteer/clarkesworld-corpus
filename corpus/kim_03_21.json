This was as good as an amusement park when you were a kid; it was a wonderland of delicious food stalls and a typical weekend haunt because your grandfather lived two blocks away.\n Your grandfather is dead. Your instance gave you the news: a phone call in the dead of night that woke you from a dead sleep.\n \u201cHello?\u201d you said, accented with slumber.\n \u201cIs this Soyoung Kang?\u201d your own voice said, accented with Korean.\n \u201cYes,\u201d you said. The only people who still call you Soyoung are family. Everyone else calls you Rose.\n \u201cHarabeoji\u2019s dead,\u201d your instance said. You dropped the phone in shock.\n You hadn\u2019t heard from Harabeoji in a decade and a half. For a while there were phone calls on your birthday, his voice tinny from the other side of the world. He would say happy birthday, and you would say thank you, and he would ask how\u2019s school, and you would say it\u2019s okay. Then you would ask how is Soyoung in Korea? because you remembered the little girl on the other side of the immigration checkpoint, wearing your clothes and your face and your memories.\n Your instance.\n Your-her grandfather would say she\u2019s fine! She and her mother came to visit me yesterday. Her mother. Your other mother. The instance of your own mother standing next to you and pretending not to listen to your conversation.\n Okay, you would say. Harabeoji never told you anything interesting about the other Soyoung. You eventually stopped asking, because you had homework, field hockey practice, college applications\u2014you were happy living your American adolescence.\n This is what you remembered, when your instance told you that harabeoji was dead. His silence about her. As if her existence was anathema to yours.\n You picked your phone back up again and listened to your instance. She spoke to you in complete banmal, no formal suffixes for her other self. Grandfather\u2019s dead. He wanted to see you before he died, but he died before we could email you about it. Yes, we saw it coming.\n You don\u2019t have to come to the funeral, but he said he wanted you here.\n She said nothing about what she wanted, or why she was the one calling instead of an aunt or a cousin. She said nothing about how she felt about Harabeoji\u2019s death, but you could guess her emotions based on the first ten years of being the same person. Maybe her sadness was like a foreign shore, which was how your sadness felt. You couldn\u2019t imagine how she felt about talking to you.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d you told your instance, in the dark warmth of your bedroom. \u201cI\u2019ll be there when I can.\u201d\n You arranged plane tickets. You arranged time off from work. You arranged a cat-sitter for Doctor Crouton. And now you are in Seoul, in a basement ripped from your memories, waiting for your instance to find you.\n An instance is a duplicate self-cleaved mitosis-like from the original\u2014though the duplicate and the original are both referred to as \u201cinstances\u201d in modern vocabularies. To become an instance is to instantiate; in the present tense, instancing.\n The oldest clear reference to instances is a line in Hammurabi\u2019s Code translated as the foreign brother-self will receive no inheritance.\n Different cultures refer to instances with a technicolor diversity: the sibling-self, the changeling, the one-who-does-not-return. The first requirement for instancing is a settled culture, though traditionally instances appear specifically in seafaring cultures. Through most of history, the ocean formed a natural division between the familiar and the foreign.\n The second requirement is intent. Sailors throughout history are recorded as sailing from their home ports without instancing for decades, until one morning they boarded their ship and looked back to see their instance standing at the docks. Something must have shifted in their heart, some secret admittance that their leave-taking is permanent, that their families have become foreign to them.\n There is a folktale that is repeated in Japan, Korea, and coastal China, of a fisherman who is coaxed into following a water spirit into an undersea court, where he drinks and dances with the beautiful merfolk. But the night grows long, so the fisherman asks the water spirit to take him back to his home. The spirit warns him that time flows differently underwater, but the fisherman repeats that he wants to go home.\n The spirit nods and sadly takes the fisherman back to the shore. When the fisherman\u2019s feet touch dry land, he ages thirty years instantly. When he walks into his house, he finds himself already inside, asleep with his wife.\n A border is an artificial thing with practical consequences: the severing of the self from the self.\n Your catch sight of your instance weaving through the crowds like a ship cutting water. You stare at her as she approaches. Here is your sister-self, your shadow-could-have-been, the woman you are in another country. Here she is, looking you over with your eyes in her face, and the lines in her face are not the lines in your face, but you could have been her: twenty years winds back to when one of you stepped onto the plane and the other stayed.\n She stops a careful three feet away. \u201cDid you get here okay?\u201d she asks in Korean.\n \u201cPretty well,\u201d you respond in kind. \u201cThanks for picking me up.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re family, after all.\u201d\n \u201cAre we?\u201d you ask, and she laughs, and you laugh. It feels something like release.\n \u201cLet me get you a coffee or something,\u201d you say. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she says.\n \u201cNo, I\u2019m putting you to enough trouble,\u201d you say. She smiles a bit at that, the same way you smile when something is funny but not happy. You can read her thoughts in that instant: it\u2019ll make her feel better to buy me a coffee, I want a coffee and she wants to buy me a coffee, let\u2019s skip the posturing, I know that she knows that I know.\n \u201cVanilla latte, with an extra pump of sugar,\u201d she says. You nod to hide your surprise. You\u2019ve always taken your coffee black.\n The distance between you and your instance is manufactured, not inherent. You know this. Your instance knows this. You both share in the creation of the space between the two of you, between yourself and your mother, between yourself and her-your Korean aunts and uncles, between her and her mother, between your mother and her mother. The only thing not your fault is the relationship between your mother and your-her grandfather.\n Your instance and her mother get Korea, her-your aunts and uncles, your-her grandfather. They get the physical presence. They get Chuseok. They get your-her grandmother\u2019s grave. They get stationary stores and E-mart and working public transit, they get the ajumma selling ginkgo nuts and roasted chestnuts at the foot of the hiking trails.\n You and your mother get America.\n You could call this fair trade. You could call this the inherent outcome of your mother\u2019s feud with your-her grandfather, a tender wound not your own, which you never completely probed. You could have researched your instance\u2014you know her name, her birthday, her school history until you left the country. You could have contacted her through your aunts. But you didn\u2019t.\n It\u2019s not like you have anything against instances in the abstract. Your best friend from college split into instances nearly a decade ago after transferring to the German branch of her company. She hadn\u2019t expected to instantiate, but Caroline\u2019s heart apparently thought her future lay across the Atlantic.\n You love both Carolines. The last time the two of you spoke, German Caroline told you she was planning on returning to America.\n \u201cIt\u2019s been fun,\u201d she said to you. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to come home. I think I want to dis-instantiate. Don\u2019t tell Caroline, yet.\u201d\n \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d you said, cradling the phone between your shoulder and ear as you rinsed dishes in your sink.\n \u201cNo,\u201d German Caroline said. \u201cI haven\u2019t told her, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re psychic.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a big thing,\u201d you said. \u201cDis-instancing. I didn\u2019t think people really did that.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a big thing in the States,\u201d she agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want to talk to her first.\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d you said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to see you again.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Caroline said. \u201cYou see me all the time. You guys get brunch like, every Sunday.\u201d\n Here is the second half of the sailor\u2019s folktale:\n The sailor returns home and finds his instance asleep in bed with his wife. He looks down at their bodies, the slow rise and fall of his instance\u2019s chest. The way his instance\u2019s arm curls sweetly around his wife\u2019s waist. He forgets the endless beautiful night he spent in the underwater court, he remembers only that thirty years of his life have been erased.\n A great and terrible anger rises in him. How dare his other self be content. How dare his other self have three decades with his wife.\n He picks up his instance\u2019s knife from where it hangs on the wall. He kneels above his other self.\n He plunges the knife into his other self\u2019s breast.\n His instance wakes in a great gasp. He claws at the air. He screams. His wife, waking, beats at the sailor\u2019s chest. Husband! she shouts. The sailor\u2019s instance grasps at his jacket, at his sleeves. The sailor holds the knife down.\n His instance tears the wet fabric. He manages to grab the sailor\u2019s bare wrist.\n And then there is a single man lying there, bleeding from his breast wound, his own hand holding the knife in place. The sailor and his instance having merged, falling into a single self like a collapsing waveform.\n In some versions of the story, the sailor survives his self-inflicted wounds. In others he does not.\n The message remains the same in either version of the story: Intention does not matter in homecoming. There is no requirement of desire to return for de-instancing. What matters is the physical action, the touch of skin against skin.\n Your instance weaves the two of you over to the parking garage where her small silver car is parked. She opens the trunk for you, but doesn\u2019t help with your suitcase, which you struggle to lift.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to risk\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d you tell her, and grunt as you push the suitcase in. You don\u2019t want to touch her either. You get in the car. She turns on the engine. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d you ask, pretending not to glance around the car. It reminds you of your mother\u2019s old car, not so much in appearance but in the smell of it. There\u2019s a car seat in the back. You didn\u2019t know your instance had a kid.\n Your instance sighs. \u201cThe plan is for you to stay with me tonight, unless you want to stay with keunimo, but I think she\u2019s busy with arranging everything. You missed the funeral home bits. But he\u2019s being buried tomorrow. So, we\u2019re just going home tonight, unless there\u2019s anything you want to do. Do you want to get dinner?\u201d\n You don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything you want to do. You want to go to the kalguksu place near your old apartment, the restaurant where they would bring out huge pots of simmering clam broth and noodles. You want to go to a 7-11 and get an ice cream bar and a banana milk. You want to go back inside the Shinsegae basement and buy yourself jun, mandu, twigim, and eat all of it at the food court in a feat of decadence your mother never would have allowed.\n You wish you were home in your apartment in Fort Lee, heating up a single serving of rice and leftovers, your cat purring by your side. You wish your grandfather wasn\u2019t dead, that you were not here in this country.\n \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d you say. \u201cLet\u2019s get dinner.\u201d\n The English word nostalgia derives from the Ancient Greek nostos, which refers to a genre of epic literature involving safe homecoming by sea. Nostos can be contrasted against kleos, the glory earned through great deeds. The two are not necessarily mutually exclusive\u2014Odysseus\u2019 nostos is his kleos. His return to his wife, meeting his son, and the acceptance of his instance are simultaneously his triumph against Poseidon, his wife\u2019s suitors, and his own self-doubt.\n In the narrative, Odysseus dislikes the man his instance became after he left for Troy\u2014weak willed and unable to stand up to his wife\u2019s suitors. Only by leaving, by fighting for ten years at Troy and spending another decade attempting to return to Ithaca, does Odysseus become a man he recognizes as himself. Yet it is the embrace of his own faults that allows him to finally return home, completely and wholly.\n Odysseus\u2019 story is an outlier\u2014no other epic focuses so heavily on the relationship between instances, or creates the sort of conflict that Odysseus has between himselves. And in reality, instances don\u2019t tend toward conflict\u2014they know too much about each other, and it\u2019s too easy for them to anticipate each other\u2019s actions. What they want is often too similar to be separated.\n Your instance takes you to a local barbecue place, where you meet up with your cousin who you haven\u2019t talked to in two decades, your instance\u2019s husband, and your instance\u2019s daughter. She\u2019s an adorable four year old who stares at you surreptitiously.\n \u201cAre we drinking?\u201d your cousin\u2014Jungwon\u2014asks. He\u2019s sitting next to you, and had given you a big hug when he walked into the restaurant. He used to be your favorite cousin. He\u2019d grown up in the time you were gone.\n \u201cPlease, yes,\u201d you say, and Jungwon orders a few green bottles of soju for the table.\n \u201cReally?\u201d your instance\u2019s husband\u2014Taehyung, but call me Tae, haha, yeah, like the band member\u2014says, with amusement in his voice. You\u2019ve been trying not to think about how he\u2019s handsome. How he has nice hands.\n \u201cIt\u2019s what Harabeoji would have wanted,\u201d Jungwon says. \u201cJust a few toasts. We gotta honor his memory.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that, you drunk,\u201d your instance says with a smile on her face that mirrors your own.\n Jungwon gasps in mock offense.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s a drunk?\u201d the daughter says, and everyone laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny!\u201d\n \u201cJust grown-up teasing,\u201d your instance says, giving her kid a kiss on the cheek that the kid squirms away from halfheartedly. You can\u2019t stop staring at the way the kid fits in your instance\u2019s lap like she belongs there.\n \u201cWhy\u2019d Harabeoji want me to come, do you know?\u201d you say, tamping down the discomfort bubbling in your chest. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked in years.\u201d\n \u201cHe talked about you a lot,\u201d Jungwon says. \u201cBefore he died. You and your mom.\u201d\n \u201cFamily was important to him,\u201d Tae says. \u201cI learned that when I wanted to marry Soyoung. He was a big \u2018duty and loyalty\u2019 sort of guy.\u201d\n \u201cWar generation,\u201d Jungwon says sagely. \u201cI think not knowing about what happened in the north kind of haunted him.\u201d\n \u201cI think he always hoped you\u2019d come back,\u201d your instance says. Your eyes snap up. You want her to explain, but she\u2019s looking away now, busy moving the kid to her own seat.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s living in the States like?\u201d Tae asks.\n \u201cWell, everyone speaks English,\u201d you say, and everyone laughs. Then the food begins to arrive, and it\u2019s a scramble to clear the table so that the plates of banchan, meat, lettuce, rice in metal bowls, and kimchi can all fit around the grill. Conversation turns to cooking meat, pouring drinks.\n \u201cTo the old man,\u201d Jungwon says, and you all clink shot glasses. This at least is easy. Like slotting into a life you had forgotten living.\n What\u2019s living in the States like?\n America is Costco and Starbucks and freeways; America is H Mart and boba and FOBs and bananas and first gen, second gen, third gen. America means KSA and APSA in college, and it means clicking the box that says \u201cAsian/Pacific-Islander\u201d on the job applications and the census, America means being asked so, where are you from? and nobody meaning New Jersey.\n America means not knowing which of your friends are instances.\n In 1776, the Constitution granted full rights to white, male, landowning instances\u2014unheard of in Europe at the time\u2014and not much to anyone else, until amendment after amendment chipped away at the assumptions underlying it. There\u2019s still a lot to carve away.\n Instancing exploded globally from the eighteenth century onward. Colonization duplicated people across the globe. Immigration through Ellis and Angel Islands created vast swathes of instanced communities across the coasts. This is the legacy of the west: a mitosis-like duplication of the self across lands already peopled.\n Instancing is written into America\u2019s blood, into the story it tells itself: Here is where instances immigrate. Give us your tired, your poor, your hungry, give us your copies and let them be fruitful and multiply, let them homestead, let them become titans of industry, let them and their non-instanced children build cities and towns and railroads.\n America assumes instances will stay forever.\n Here is a free state for those who want to leave, America says, ignoring the fact that the land was already peopled, that the borders were brought to them unwillingly. Ignoring those brought in force in chains. Ignoring the deportations at the border. Ignoring the fact that intention to leave actually just means acceptance of situations beyond your control.\n Living in the States means that you\u2019re blank-American. Korean-American. Mexican-American. African-American. Indian-American. Native American. America assumes instances leave their original country permanently and defines them by the self left behind.\n Halfway through dinner, Jungwon and you take a smoke break outside. Cold air, warm nicotine. It\u2019s nice. It\u2019s strange to watch Jungwon and your instance together, the familiarity between them, more like sister and brother than cousins. Good strange.\n \u201cSo, what\u2019s she like? Soyoung, I mean,\u201d you ask Jungwon. You remember him being honest. \u201cShe seemed pretty high-strung during dinner.\u201d\n Jungwon waves a hand in the air, trailing smoke. \u201cEh. She\u2019s having a rough time of it. You\u2019re not seeing her at her best,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know how it is, Harabeoji\u2019s last words to her was about wanting her to dis-instance, you know, all of that. That was pretty shitty of the old man.\u201d\n You stop, cigarette halfway to your lips. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Jungwon stops. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\n \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t tell me! All she told me was that Harabeoji wanted me to come to the funeral. Jesus Christ, did he really ask her that? Dying wish, ask her to dis-instantiate?\u201d\n You are abruptly reevaluating how much you knew about your-her grandfather. You know Harabeoji was born before the Korean War. You know your family is from the north. You know your grandmother died when you were very young. You know Harabeoji liked to watch baseball and that he kept sweet jelly cup snacks in his cupboard for you and your cousins.\n \u201cYep,\u201d Jungwon says, looking uncomfortable. \u201cLook, you should talk to her about it, not me. I probably shouldn\u2019t have told you about it if she didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d\n \u201cNo, you should have told me sooner! That\u2019s so fucked up. Who asks that sort of thing?\u201d\n \u201cWell, Harabeoji did.\u201d\n You know your grandfather was bitterly opposed to your mother moving to America. You know him and your mother had a blowup fight two nights before you moved, screaming at each other while one of your older cousins hustled you and Jungwon out of the apartment. You know your grandfather drove you and your mother to the airport anyway, but didn\u2019t speak except to tell you to be good for your mom, Soyoung-ah.\n You\u2019re pretty sure him and your mother-in-America never spoke again.\n The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953, creating the demilitarized zone that splits the peninsula into north and south. The Republic of Korea has the tenth largest nominal GDP in the world, globally consumed entertainment exports, and a remarkably high percentage of plastic surgery among its populace. The Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea has nuclear weapons, a fascist dictatorship built around a cult of personality, and a thriving black market for international media. The two countries never formally ended the war. Both countries post soldiers on their side of the DMZ, blank-faced men with mirrored sunglasses.\n Crossing a border creates an instance. Creating a border manifests the capability for instances.\n For a short time during the Korean War, it was possible to cross the DMZ with the right papers. The DMZ wasn\u2019t quite a border yet, not coalesced in the hearts and minds of the people as a border. So much had happened to Korea in the past decades. Japanese occupation, name changes, comfort women, the phasing out of the Korean language. The theft of thousands of cultural artifacts. Global war, local war, foreign powers playing toy soldiers with foreigners, ideologies grappling in Korea before they moved to Vietnam.\n Soyoung\u2019s grandfather crossed a border-becoming-a-border. He didn\u2019t look back at who he might be leaving behind.\n The next morning, your instance drives you to the gravesite. It\u2019s rush hour in Seoul, and you both sit uncomfortably in your black clothing. Your instance\u2019s husband and daughter will be coming later in the day, but you almost wish they were here now. You try not to watch your instance, but her visage reflects off the passenger window.\n Seoul crawls past in fits and bursts. Storefronts selling fish cake and twigim and ddukbokki, 7-11s with cardboard K-Pop stars advertising soft drinks and soju.\n You have never more desperately wanted to initiate a conversation. A dialogue. An interrogation. You want to ask about Harabeoji\u2019s last request to her, how she feels about it, what she wants to do. You want to ask her your questions without fear of the answers, except you know that the moment you ask is the moment she will refuse to speak. Because you would refuse to speak. It would scare you, to talk. It scares you now.\n You know that she knows that you are scared. So, you can\u2019t ask.\n You watch the scenery instead. High-rise apartment buildings, signs for after-school tutoring facilities, bus stops and subway stations. Dozens of coffee shops. You don\u2019t remember this route. You hadn\u2019t expected Seoul to change so much\u2014the Seoul in your memories was static, a snow globe of 1998. You feel like a foreigner. Like an American.\n Your family has lived in Seoul for two and a half generations. Your grandfather relocated here after the war, and your mother and her sisters were born here, and you were born here, and you could have lived your whole life in this city. Your grandfather died here.\n \u201cIt was old age, right?\u201d you ask. \u201cNot a heart attack or cancer or anything.\u201d\n \u201cHe was eighty-seven,\u201d your instance says. \u201cIsn\u2019t everything old age at that point?\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d you say. It always surprises you when your instance says things you wouldn\u2019t. It surprises you more when she says things you would.\n \u201cWe kind of saw it coming,\u201d she says, looking straight at the road. \u201cI mean. Eighty-seven, right?\u201d\n \u201cRight,\u201d you say, daring a glance at her. She looks perfectly calm. \u201cWere you close? I remember I used to spend a lot of time at his apartment as a kid.\u201d\n She shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s just . . . Harabeoji, right? Mom would park me at his place on weekends. Sometimes he\u2019d call you when I was over. It was like seeing me reminded him that you existed.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d you say. \u201cHe never said anything about you, no matter how much I asked.\u201d\n \u201cWell, here\u2019s how you should picture it,\u201d she says, rolling to a stop at a red light. \u201cHe\u2019s on the phone, sitting on the sofa, half-watching me and half-watching the baseball game. And I\u2019m sitting at the kitchen table doing some homework I didn\u2019t finish at hagwon. And he\u2019s talking to you, and you\u2019re talking to him, and I\u2019m doing my best to be really quiet with my pencil so I can hear what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\n You can picture the apartment with the clarity of a reconstructed childhood memory. The smooth glass tabletop. The creased leather couch. The way it smelled a little like smoke, even though harabeoji only ever smoked outside. You can imagine Harabeoji holding the old landline against his ear. You can imagine yourself sitting at the kitchen table doing homework. Listening.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with that,\u201d you say, after a long pause.\n \u201cWell. I didn\u2019t either,\u201d your instance says, and it feels like you\u2019re circling back around the conversation again, taking a derivative and never quite managing to meet the x-axis.\n In many ways, it is easy for the man in the folktale. He never had to talk to his other self. And besides, what is three days compared to thirty years? One beautiful, strange night in a foreign country subsumed under thirty years of eating dinner with his wife, raising his children, taking his boat across the glittering shore and casting his nets. Time polishes the memory of the undersea court to a pearl, something carefully tucked away under the rough cloth of his weekday worries.\n Or he dies, bleeding out through the self-inflicted wound.\n A traditional Korean funeral is held over three days, ending with the burial. Traditional Korean graves are earthen mounds on mountainsides, with nearby stone markers on which Chinese characters are written.\n Most people are cremated now. Korea is a very small country, and it has only so many mountains. But your grandfather is traditional, and his burial plot has been purchased for decades\u2014ever since your grandmother\u2019s death.\n The gravesite is familiar. A hill on the outskirts of Seoul, a clearing in the middle of the forest underneath the blue sky. This is why you\u2019re wearing black hiking boots instead of heels.\n Family and friends and strangers in black, dry eyes, wet eyes, your aunts and cousins exclaiming over you. You must be so tired from the travel! It\u2019s so good to see you again! How\u2019s your mother? You speak Korean and stumble over your syllables.\n The burial happens. The coffin. Shovels. Dirt and sod.\n Your grandfather\u2019s grave is a large mound of earth, encased in a stone foundation with a shiny black granite marker. Your chest hurts to look at it, the sort of bone-deep dull sadness when a part of you that you thought was already dead dies. You didn\u2019t realize what it would mean to miss your grandfather until this moment.\n Your instance walks over to you. You glance up as she approaches. She had been standing near her husband and daughter, while you stood near Jungwon and your other cousins, who had all exclaimed to see you.\n \u201cIt\u2019s weird being here when it\u2019s not Chuseok,\u201d your instance says. Her eyes are red-rimmed.\n \u201cOh you think it\u2019s weird to be here?\u201d you respond, and she laughs and you laugh and the laughter feels like a thin soap bubble film stretched across your words.\n \u201cDon\u2019t laugh,\u201d Jungwon says, without any heat. \u201cThe aunts will get mad.\u201d\n \u201cSorry,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s just that, you know. This still doesn\u2019t feel real.\u201d\n Jungwon peers at you. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n Two days ago you were home in Fort Lee. Your biggest emotional hurdles were making sure you did the laundry before you ran out of socks, or deciding whether to get dim sum or American brunch with Caroline over the weekend. You hadn\u2019t thought about your instance, your family in Korea, your grandfather, in months, and even when you thought of them it was in passing, as if they were a dream you only vacantly remembered, something tamped down and buried.\n A beat of silence that stretches too long. Your instance laughs. You do not laugh.\n \u201cShit, oppa, of course she\u2019s not okay!\u201d your instance says. \u201cShe just learned Harabeoji died two days ago, and now she had to fly all the way here for the fucking funeral, which she missed, what were you expecting?\u201d\n \u201cUh\u2014\u201d Jungwon says. Your instance\u2019s voice spiraled into a shout. Everyone\u2019s staring.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d you cut in, staring at your instance. Her face has gone all blotchy under her makeup.\n \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m going to get some air,\u201d she says, and you almost reach for her when she turns on her heel, but Jungwon catches your hand instead.\n \u201cLet\u2019s give her a moment to cool off,\u201d he says, but you chase after your other self anyway.\n A plethora of related terminology borrows the terminology of instancing. For instance, software development. When Soyoung \u201cRose\u201d Kang, in her real-true-American-job, downloads a copy of her company\u2019s repository from the cloud, that\u2019s called instancing, the same way the three steps across the immigration gate was instancing. A perfect copy is duplicated in a new location.\n When Soyoung \u201cRose\u201d Kang is done making her changes to the file, she will de-instance it, merging the file with the original on the server. The changes slot into the original, and the new copy becomes the official version on the server. The original copy without the changes is overwritten by the instance. Integration of the other into the self.\n You catch up to your other self. She\u2019s come back to where the car is parked, and she\u2019s leaned against the side, pretending not to wipe her eyes.\n She looks askance at you. \u201cWhat do you want.\u201d A statement. Her voice your voice. Her hurt unlike your hurt. You feel like a stranger all of a sudden, so far removed from the way she sounds, unable to understand the way she feels.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you say. Plain banmal. \u201cI was tired of talking around things. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a tough time. I\u2019m sorry that Harabeoji asked you to de-instance.\u201d\n She smears a finger under her eye, blotting a tear. \u201cJungwon told you, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Last night. He told me to talk to you about it. But I thought you would bring it up if you wanted to talk about it.\u201d\n \u201cWhen have we ever brought anything up?\u201d she says. You laugh. She laughs. Neither of you are happy.\n \u201cI could be someone direct,\u201d you say. \u201cAmerica changes people.\u201d\n \u201cDoes it?\u201d she asks. \u201cHave you changed that much?\u201d\n Time, space, the American public school system. You don\u2019t know if change is something that happens to you all at once, or if you could chart your life in millimeters and that maybe years ago you could have understood each other.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a kid,\u201d you say. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a husband, or that you drank your coffee sweet. I didn\u2019t know I could be that sort of person. I didn\u2019t know that Harabeoji could be someone to ask so much of you. I don\u2019t think you should do anything you don\u2019t want to do. I don\u2019t want to do anything you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d\n She looks at you. And now you finally recognize the expression in her face. Hunger.\n \u201cI want to,\u201d she says.\n The English word nostalgia is derived from Greek word algea, the plural personification of pain.\n Your surprise naked on your face. Her hunger tucked away again behind her blank mask.\n \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t expect that,\u201d she says.\n \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you dis-instantiate me, then?\u201d you ask. She had the opportunities. When you bought her coffee. When you were in the car. When you sat near her in the restaurant. When you slept, defenseless, on her pullout futon. Dis-instancing is about physical contact, not about mutual desire.\n \u201cYou said it. I don\u2019t want to do anything you don\u2019t want to do,\u201d she says, echoing your American accent, your inflected Korean. It sounds strange through her mouth. That must be how it sounds through your mouth. She smiles at you, a sarcastic twist of the lip. \u201cCould I live with myself, if I did that?\u201d\n Maybe you should be glad there is no instance of you that is cruel.\n Instances cannot read each other\u2019s minds.\n \u201cBut I want to,\u201d she says again. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to know what it was like, to live somewhere else. To be the one to leave. To be American. I wondered about you. When I had to take suneung. When I would fight with mom. When I was getting married. Did you ever wonder about me?\u201d\n You did. You thought about your other self when you picked your college major. When you fought with your mother. When it was Chuseok and you were alone in your dorm room, eating dduk that your mother mailed you.\n \u201cI did,\u201d you say. You want to know how she loves her husband. How she loves her daughter. How she talks with her-your cousins and how she goes to work in her silver car and how she orders at restaurants in Korean and how she speaks in Korean and dreams in Korean and how she misses Harabeoji as more than a crumpled memory.\n \u201cI guess it\u2019s selfish, to want to know two lives,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t help what I want.\u201d\n Soyoung\u2019s grandfather always regretted not looking back across the border.\n \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot to ask,\u201d your instance says. \u201cAnd it was cruel of Harabeoji to ask me, and it would be cruel of me to force you. But I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m happy here, and I love my husband, and I love my daughter, and I don\u2019t know who you love, but you could love who I love. I could love who you love. If that changes your decision, at all.\u201d\n Your heart thumping in your chest. Your dry mouth. Your instance standing a scant three feet away, smiling at you.\n \u201cSo, let me know what you want,\u201d she says.\n The three keystrokes it takes to push a de-instancing request to the server.\n You want to take your other self\u2019s hand and fold her into your existence. You want to hide in your apartment with the soft warm weight of your cat in your arms. You want to call Caroline in Germany and commiserate. You want to smoke outside barbecue restaurants with Jungwon. You want to go back to your grandfather\u2019s grave and apologize for taking so long to visit.\n You want to pick up your instance\u2019s daughter and have her be your own. You want to have grown up in Korea. You want to have grown up in America. You want there to be only one of you. You want your other self to be happy. You want to fulfill your grandfather\u2019s last request. You want to be happy. You want to stop wanting. You want to go home.\n Filial piety never rested easy against American exceptionalism.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that easy,\u201d you say. Your instance\u2019s face crystallizing in her smile. You can\u2019t look at this, because even if it\u2019s not your feelings, you understand the way that disappointment feels in her heart.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll remember, if we dis-instantiate. You\u2019ll remember, and I\u2019ll remember, but it\u2019s not going to make you happier. It won\u2019t make Harabeoji and Umma make up retroactively, and it won\u2019t stop me from having left, and maybe it\u2019s selfish, but I have a life. I have a job, and I have a cat, and I have friends, and they could be ours, but then they wouldn\u2019t be mine. And it won\u2019t make Harabeoji happy, because he\u2019s dead, and what he wants can\u2019t be more important than what I want, and I\u2019m sorry about that but it\u2019s true. And I wish there was a way for me to have everything\u2014for you to have everything\u2014but there isn\u2019t. I can\u2019t live my life and live yours at the same time.\u201d\n You are suddenly achingly homesick. Home like your grandfather\u2019s apartment, twenty years ago. Home like falling asleep in the back seat of your mom\u2019s car. Home like waking up in your childhood bedroom. You won\u2019t ever get any of that back, and losing that wasn\u2019t your choice, but you can choose how to live with the loss of all the people you used to be.\n \u201cIf we dis-instantiate, America becomes a memory for you. For me. Just like Korea is a memory for me. You\u2019ll remember, because I\u2019ll remember, and you\u2019ll regret, because I\u2019ve regretted. I know you will. I know about regret. I miss Korea, sometimes. I\u2019d miss America more,\u201d you say.\n You don\u2019t know how to explain the way you feel about the States to your instance, who has never had to leave home. How she-you will long for worlds that no longer exist, for countries that only exist in your memories, how you\u2019ve had years to come to terms with the tension that sits in your belly when you think about the homes you\u2019ve left behind, how you have changed enough to miss America, now, and you can bear the loss of one homeland but not two. How to explain she would become a foreigner. How to explain to her how you are Korean-American. How you are American.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want that for you,\u201d you say instead. \u201cOr for me.\u201d\n Your other self\u2019s smile melts into something less cracked. You smile back in relief.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s only regret,\u201d she says, and reaches for your hand and you\u2014\n The knife in the heart, held by the fisherman\u2019s hand.\n Isabel J.

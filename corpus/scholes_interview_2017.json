Rivers and mountain ranges spill over the margins slipping through gaps in fingers as they make their way through a reader\u2019s mind. Worlds built over the course of a book series breathe and expand with the lives and machinations of characters and civilizations. Even when series comes to an end, the world lives on long after in the mind of the reader. No better is this illustrated than the world created by Ken Scholes in The Psalms of Isaak.\nReaders were first introduced to the world of The Psalms of Isaak with Lamentation. Over the course of the series, the universe encompassing The Named Lands and the Moon have grown complex, multilayered, and more populous with a fascinating cast of characters. In the final volume of The Psalms of Isaak, Hymn, Scholes concludes the five-book epic in spectacular fashion. Battle for the Named Lands rages, family members are pitted against one another, and a Younger God takes power on the Moon.\nKen Scholes is the multiple award-winning author of The Psalms of Isaak and numerous works of short fiction. He has won the Writers of the Future Award, France\u2019s Prix Imaginales, the Endeavour Award, and others. Hymn, the conclusion to The Psalms of Isaak series, will be available from Tor Books on December 5th.\nWhen was the first time you realized that you wanted to be a writer?\nI started stapling pages together into little books sometime in first grade but things really stuck once I read Ray Bradbury\u2019s essay \u201cHow to Keep and Feed a Muse\u201d in an old textbook around age thirteen or fourteen.\nWhat drew you to short fiction when you started writing?\nInitially, it was Bradbury\u2019s essay and his own focus on short fiction. And a lot of my other heroes from the pulp era also started with short stories. It seemed to me that was the path\u2014start small and then go big as the writing muscles developed. But over time, it became comfortable and I found myself really nervous about writing anything longer than 10,000 words. Still, I\u2019m glad I put my time in there because all those sheds I built seemed to have helped me build some mansions.\nHas the world you\u2019ve created surprised you with how it has evolved over The Psalms of Isaak series?\nAbsolutely. Initially, I had just enough world for a short story. But as I started expanding, the world very quickly took on its own life. I discovered hidden civilizations and forgotten spaces in the world as I wrote, right up to the last book.\nHow do you combine your science and fantasy? Do you have a special formula for which aspects of the world get the sci-fi treatment or vice versa?\nI don\u2019t have a formula. And I accidentally backed into being lauded as \u201cseamlessly mixing science fiction and fantasy\u201d but really, all I\u2019ve done is only reveal to the reader what the POV characters believe about themselves and their world. Since prior to the first book\u2019s launch, there\u2019s been some back and forth about whether the series was one or the either or both. In the truest sense, it\u2019s fantasy in the way that The Martian Chronicles is fantasy but it\u2019s dressed up as SF . . . which looks at least through the first few books like epic(ish) fantasy.\nThere\u2019s a quote from Hebda in your newest novel that reads \u201cWhat is and isn\u2019t possible is being redefined daily.\u201d What is something you\u2019ve discovered recently that you previously thought impossible?\nSo many things. I think the biggest is that I didn\u2019t believe I would be able to have a life free of the PTSD that\u2019s dogged me since age two. And yet I\u2019m now nearly three years in remission thanks to the miracle of modern science and a little-known psychological framework born out of BC in the \u201970s that has reshaped my cognitive approach to life in general. I\u2019ve had more peace of mind than I can remember ever having previously which has meant a much nicer, quieter life in general.\nWho is one author that influenced the Psalms of Isaak series?\nThere would be no Psalms of Isaak without Jay Lake. His friendship led directly or indirectly to most of my body of work. His dare to go write Lamentation, his introduction to my first agent and my editor at Tor, his deep love for the series, and his support of me as I wrote it\u2014these things all came together in powerful ways in my life.\nHow does it feel to finish the series?\nIt feels fantastic. It\u2019s been nearly two years now since I typed \u201cEND\u201d and now, watching it finally come out gives me a sense of accomplishment. These five novels were the hardest bit of writing I\u2019ve ever done in my life partly because I had to write them through such tough circumstances.\nWhat is your next project on the horizon?\nI have no idea. I\u2019ve been on sabbatical largely since finishing Hymn. Before that I had a PTSD book in development and since, I\u2019ve thought I might move to YA and I\u2019m researching another non-fiction book at the moment but I have no idea when I\u2019ll start drafting it. I\u2019ve said yes to some short stories after the first of the year but to be honest, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the break and feel no burning need to put more Ken Scholes stories into the world.\nDo you plan to revisit this world again or do you feel like you\u2019ve completed what you\u2019ve set out to do?\nI\u2019ve left that up to the audience and to Leroy, my inner redneck muse. I have many more stories in that world buried in the basement of my brain, set both before and after this particular series. And I\u2019ve also thought about telling some of those stories through Tor.com\u2019s novella line. We\u2019ll see how much demand there is for more.\nHow much of the series did you have planned before writing the first book?\nVery, very little. I\u2019m a discovery writer who writes by the seat of his pants. So, there are very few notes and even in the last book, I was surprised by the new bits I discovered about my world and characters.\nThe depth of the characters in your new novel really struck me. What does your process look like when developing a character?\nI just know them and write them the way they \u201cseem\u201d to me. And I learn more about each character as I write them. It\u2019s instinctive and I always lock up a little when I try to describe the process because it lives beyond my power to describe.\nWhy do you sometimes refer to yourself as \u201cTrailer Boy\u201d?\nI grew up in a double-wide at the edge of the woods and at the foot of Mt Rainier. It was a Trailer Boy childhood with car parts in the yard and tires stacked against the various sheds. And it was a dark childhood\u2014the kind that gives kids PTSD at a very young age\u2014full of all kinds of icky things like racism, sexism, xenophobia, homophobia. So, it\u2019s a reminder to me of where I come from and what our capacity is to grow beyond our origin stories.\nChris Urie is a writer and editor from Ocean City, NJ.

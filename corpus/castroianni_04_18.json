I dreamed I was swimming in the seas of my homeland again. My hair turned into seaweed thick with petrol; my mouth tasted like radiation and uranium. I opened my eyes\u2014lashes threaded with sticky fish entrails\u2014and found myself on a starboat made out of the silken carcasses of sand-sparrows. I see fingers and nacre-colored fingernails, fingertips burned to sable, spidery blood vessels twirling like ribbons on the tails of kites still riding the wind. Every time I think I have escaped that life, a tidal wave of fear rises again to engulf me.\nStar seas are full of dead bodies. We\u2019re drowning in an ocean of floating body parts.\n\u201cAnother ship has crashed, sir.\u201d\nYour even, soothing voice draws me out of my rapture. Luciole, you are programmed to speak the profoundest horrors in the levelest voice I\u2019ve ever heard.\nWe\u2019re in my office, the paper-thin walls making it barely quiet, and I turn away from the window because the view of the universe makes me, to this day, sick with nausea. \u201cReport,\u201d I say.\nMagenta and lime green lights syncopate on your interface. By now I am able to get a good hint of your whims and emotions even though you don\u2019t have a human face. \u201cTwenty-three emergency pods have reached Sandpiper Station since yesterday.\u201d\nAnd how many more have crashed into space debris, blowing up with all their human cargo? I won\u2019t ask; I don\u2019t want to know.\n\u201cFifteen more have reached Swallow and Stork,\u201d you go on. Civilians, militia, media, governments, both rich and poor\u2014everyone\u2019s complaining and asking why station AI can\u2019t block access. They forget that life pods were only made to be picked up by nearby vessels; that they do not appear on station systems because they weren\u2019t designed for this. No one ever thought that people would be so desperate to attempt intra-system travel in such poorly-made vessels.\n\u201cSurvivors?\u201d I mutter. My tongue is dry; my brow sweaty. But I\u2019ve been doing this for a while. I\u2019m a professional. I ought to know how to keep calm.\n\u201cAbout one hundred and forty,\u201d you say. Each pod is meant to hold a maximum of five people, so they left loaded with more than ten each. Those who survived, are so, so incredibly lucky. \u201cExpect severe health problems due to radiation, zero gravity, and poor health conditions. All survivors have taken shelter in the Flower Cemetery.\u201d\n\u201cMore of them in the Cemetery? There\u2019s no space left down there.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they are, sir. Nowhere else they can go,\u201d you ground me with your matter-of-factness. If you had any shoulders, you would shrug. \u201cShall we start? You have appointments.\u201d\nI nod and dive into my paperwork briefly before we leave my cardboard-thin office.\nThe image of an arm won\u2019t leave my eyes: an arm, a disembodied arm. It\u2019s been with me for twenty years now, almost like an extra limb I\u2019ve grown. I\u2019ve learned to ignore its presence, along with other monsters. But today it persists and distracts me from one moment to the next.\nLuciole, my friend. When I speak to you of home, you are the only one who stays silent and expressionless, as if every image of rocky shores sinks into your circuitry, every spoonful of neranj sweet preserve travels inside your software, to burrow somewhere warm and transform into memory.\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the parent\u2019s eyes or the child\u2019s that pluck something in me.\nWith you by my side I walk through the camp\u2014a thick forest of tents, waste, and human limbs. I push aside the hanging laundry, make my way between children chasing each other, blissful in the moment. I\u2019m wearing my padded jacket and still get shivers. The air is colder here; the station won\u2019t waste energy to regulate temperature on the level where pod people live. It\u2019s a small station anyway, meant to act as an in-between stop for the Turm when they travel from one side of their Empire to the other. When you\u2019re stuck here, there\u2019s nowhere to go. Home is hell. Here is a slightly better version of hell: one in which you die slowly, hope the only staple to sustain you.\nMy head is always misty when I\u2019m in the camps. Memories of cold bean soup and dark brown urine mingle with the present and I\u2019m not sure which planet I\u2019m standing on, which day, which reality. But I\u2019m not a child anymore. People know me and greet me\u2014other lawyers, a few humanitarian workers, some beneficiaries. \u201cWant me to tell you the poem of the day, sir?\u201d you ask. Luciole, your obsession with poetry is one of a kind. I welcome it. \u201cThe shores of my homeland, how they\u2019re full of corpses\u2014I write this poem because I can\u2019t leave them flowers.\u201d\nYour words shake me out of my trance, back into this world. Every time I\u2019m here I realize there\u2019s so little I can do. I am only a corporate lawyer, sent to Sandpiper by my company as part of its corporate responsibility program. \u201cNell is from Koohar, isn\u2019t she?\u201d my bosses said. \u201cShe will do great at Sandpiper then.\u201d All my papers say I\u2019m Turm, because Turm Empire wanted so badly to forget where I come from, but whenever it\u2019s convenient they remember my true origin.\nI could have said no to this position, really. Someone else could be handling it better than I do now\u2014without the sickness, without the flashbacks and the fugues. And now the child is tugging at my sleeve, and the parent is staring at me with those eyes that demand something, but are too stubborn to speak up. I\u2019m standing transfixed between them, a ghost caught between two worlds.\n\u201cLawyer, you\u2019re meeting with us today,\u201d she says in Luti, a Koohar language I can\u2019t speak but recognize by the sing-song inflection. You translate inside my head, voice flat and smooth like a sinking sunset.\nI draw a quick confirmation as you feed me through the mini-com the few data we have for this family: names, ages, origin, dates of arrival. My company\u2019s other lawyer had been working with them for a while, but it seems that he suddenly handed them over to me with no further explanation. Your data only state cultural reasons for the switch.\nI\u2019ve learned by now that this is code for Koohari too difficult to deal with. \u201cYes,\u201d I find myself saying, \u201clet\u2019s have a meeting now, shall we? I\u2019m Nell.\u201d\nMy impromptu office is three walls leftover medicine supplies containers, one wall micro-plastics glass that engulfs Sandpiper into its bubble, keeping breathing air inside and cosmic radiation outside. Outside, where the wide, wild space looms, full of stars, debris, and human-made vessels. Among them float dead bodies, thousands of them, but they are too small to see with naked eye. They will merge with the space debris, dissipate into the merciless void of the universe. No trace. Back to stardust.\nWe sit on the floor. \u201cUruna,\u201d I read the parent\u2019s name from the notes you\u2019re feeding me. My data doesn\u2019t say and I\u2019m quite bad myself at discerning it, so I have to ask: \u201cGender?\u201d\n\u201cSoom,\u201d she replies calmly, then points at her child. \u201cKatii is nutu.\u201d\nI nod and wonder how much of this will the asylum officers care to understand this time\u2014Koohar genders are completely incomprehensible to them. For lack of better terms, soom means child-rearing female; nutu means child-bearing male. For the Turm Empire, this distinction makes no sense. They neither have the language to accommodate it nor do they care to do that.\n\u201cMy child is ill,\u201d Uruna says before I can ask anything else. It is the only thing she has in mind now and rightfully so. Survivors of pods often arrive as bundles of star-travel disease. Nothing of it is infectious, yet still it\u2019s too easy to brand them as \u2018pod people,\u2019 as dehumanized health hazards. \u201cThey won\u2019t give me any medicine. They told me that only in Turm system they can fix him.\u201d\nLittle Katii is no more than eight. I can already see the sagging skin, devoid of luminosity, the thinning hair falling off in patches. Radiation has poisoned him, but it\u2019s not his illness that makes me think that something about him is uneasy and familiar, like looking into a mirror that distorts your image only slightly. His red-rimmed eyes won\u2019t leave mine. Katii is a silent one, but he has a fire burning inside.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t travel further in yet,\u201d I say. You momentarily distract me by folding a piece of reusable paper with your small, metallic, three-joint hands. \u201cI\u2019m here to help you with your asylum application. With refugee status, you and your child can be sent to inner Turm system. And from there somewhere more permanent. Okay?\u201d\nShe has heard all this before, yet something about her looks unconvinced. She\u2019s wary; the experience with the previous lawyer could not have been very good. Still, she nods. By now you have finished folding and you hand a small, elegant paper-bird to Katii. \u201cSand-sparrow,\u201d he says and his eyes light up. The color is unmistakably that of the desert, the golden-purple plumage of sand-sparrows. He shows it to his mother, who smiles sweetly back at him. They both look more relaxed and I\u2019m thankful you are so good at this sort of thing, Luciole. As I go through my paperwork, Uruna strokes Katii\u2019s thinning hair. She mutters a lullaby and your mellow lights join them in their sleepiness. I\u2019d rather not have the child with us as we do the interview preparation, but he is sleeping so peacefully I can\u2019t bring myself to separate them just now.\nI choose my approach carefully. Whatever trauma she is carrying with her, it is impossible to not relive during our talk. But I want to soften the impact, to make sure I know what really happened so I can help her. After a few questions on her origin, I ask, \u201cTell me, Uruna, why did you leave?\u201d\n\u201cEverything collapsed.\u201d She\u2019s staring at the darkness of the galaxy outside. Her voice is small and distant, as if coming from a faraway ocean. \u201cThe world collapsed.\u201d She turns to look at me.\nUruna\u2019s eyes are the color of my mother\u2019s eyes.\nI shake the memory from me, quickly, violently. I can\u2019t afford to deal with this now. I will return to pick it up later.\nI cough.\nKoohar\u2019s biggest problem is its ecological disaster, one that\u2019s been going on for years and years after decades of catastrophic wars. Water now covers four fifths of the planet and animals are near-extinct. Yet such disasters are never reason enough to give asylum to people fleeing from them, because that would mean accepting everyone and not only a select few. Somehow you\u2019re expected to stay on a planet that\u2019s trying to kill you.\n\u201cI know this,\u201d I say, \u201cbut it won\u2019t get you refugee status. We have to think through what you will say in your interview. Truthful things, but carefully laid out. What about the war?\u201d\n\u201cThe Haz ruined everything,\u201d she answers vaguely, as expected. Eyes wander again, as if we\u2019re at school and I\u2019m the persistent teacher and all Uruna wants is to play outside. I\u2019ll have to lay the architecture of my questions carefully, like a funnel. Start from the bigger and narrow it down to the miniscule.\n\u201cAre there any instances of fear for your lives from the Haz? Things that happened to your extended family, perhaps, and which you can tell the officer?\u201d Everyone has someone like that. I know I did.\nShe thinks for a moment, then answers, \u201cYes,\u201d letting unsaid words linger on her lips. Finally, she starts to speak.\nIt\u2019s not a linear narrative. She jumps from one thing to the next, from one day five years ago to what happened last week. You are transcribing everything and I trust your software to sort out a few things for me. Uruna surprises me by starting from the shores of Antu\u2014from my hometown. Turns out she was an immigrant there, working to gather and dry kelp, when she got caught up in the conflict with the Haz. She speaks of her birth-mother\u2019s family and of her neighbors, and of Katii\u2019s birth-father and his other raising-mother too. \u201cThen a bomb exploded,\u201d she says. \u201cTorn them both to pieces. We only found an arm.\u201d\nI close my eyes; the image of the arm comes back to me, intrudes my thoughts.\nUruna is calm, much calmer than I am, and other lawyers would be shocked at how she can recite such horrors and carry that taciturn half-smile; at how she can still speak of her home fondly, even after all the things that happened to her there. I only know I\u2019m not surprised at all: sympathy is for the privileged. Pity would be no more, you said once in the words of an old poet, if we did not make somebody poor.\nAgain, I push the image of the arm away. I try to hold on as myself is slipping away from me.\nYou hand me a glass of water at the right moment, then offer some to Uruna. I gently ask her to repeat parts of this story, to establish the relations between her relatives and make the timeline as clear as possible without exhausting or vexing her. \u201cThese stories are what you need to get your application accepted,\u201d I tell her when we\u2019re done. The arm is here with me again. It hasn\u2019t left. It never leaves. \u201cTell them as you told me. If they ask you to repeat them, don\u2019t change them. Don\u2019t give them reasons to doubt you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d\nUruna frowns, arched, thick eyebrows conferring in annoyance. Her voice rises and shakes, as if all pent-up emotion was to be channeled in this answer alone. \u201cDoubt what? We climbed on a crumbling pod to get here. We left our homes. You think we wanted that? Why would we lie?\u201d\nHer indignant inflection is so different from your flat translation. Her anger is a real piece of work: everyone comes to me scared, ready to blurt out any lie that will grant them passage out of this in-between purgatory. But Uruna is enraged.\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d I tell her and drink more water. It flows cold down my throat and does nothing to quench my thirst. \u201cBut this is how the procedure goes. They\u2019re trying to trim the edges and grant asylum only to the most vulnerable ones. You are a parent with a child\u2014a sick one too\u2014and your stories from home justify your fear. If all goes well in your interview, there won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\nUruna\u2019s suspicious look makes me think she doesn\u2019t completely trust me. I don\u2019t know what else to do. My head is empty by now; my palms itch and sting. The room has started darkening and my breath is not enough.\n\u201cLawyer, are you alright?\u201d Uruna asks in concern.\n\u201cSir, your vitals indicate need for rest and medication.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Luciole.\u201d I meet Uruna\u2019s eyes one last time\u2014my mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cI am sorry. I have to rest. You will have to meet with our psychologist now. I can arrange more meetings with another lawyer, but I hope you feel more confident in your interview?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says quickly, hiding\u2014unsuccessfully\u2014a generous portion of self-doubt. She strokes Katii\u2019s hair one last time, meets my eyes with a hint of worry. She thanks me, then gently picks him up in her arms and leaves.\n\u201cSir,\u201d you say once I\u2019ve lied down on the floor. The tranquilizer works fast and I\u2019m sinking in the numbness. \u201cThat young human looked a lot like you. The smaller one, I mean.\u201d\nI laugh, my laughter turning into a cough. Luciole. All the things I try not to notice, to hide from myself. You pick them up and hurl them right back at me. \u201cCheeky, Luciole. That\u2019s why I chose you.\u201d\nThe single red light on your interface indicates pleasure. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe arm and I have a long history, Luciole.\nBack then, it was a woman\u2019s arm. Soom, I think, because the long, calloused fingers looked like my raising-mother\u2019s who worked the fields daily. I can\u2019t recall my mother\u2019s face, but the image and texture of her fingers have always stayed with me. How they wrapped around the crocus-colored tunics she wore, how she folded them around my nettle-and-hemp dress.\nI thought I had forgotten my mother\u2019s eyes but Uruna had the exact same hue in her pupils. It was like looking straight into my mother\u2019s face.\nTonight, nightmares wake me up many times. Something has been suffocating me. You play soothing sounds of bird chirrups and running river water for me.\n\u201cSir, why did you come to Sandpiper?\u201d you surprise me. Again, this is a question outside your protocol. This is you, the personality that is Luciole, the office bot, speaking.\n\u201cMy company sent me,\u201d I tell you something you already know and we are both aware I\u2019m trying to avoid an honest answer. In the darkness, only a small white light comes from you, tracing the contours of my bed frame and duvet.\n\u201cMaybe they ought to send you back,\u201d you say, ruthless. \u201cYour flashbacks are causing you too much stress.\u201d\nAh, Luciole. Your care is something I won\u2019t forget, ever. You\u2019d be excellent in this job on your own.\n\u201cYou know I won\u2019t leave.\u201d\nPause. The white light is flickering like a distant star. \u201cI know, sir. But you\u2019re not the right person for this.\u201d\n\u201cWho is then?\u201d\nYou stay silent. You and I both know that the only people who can do this right, are all the wrong people.\n\u201cYou changed your statement? Why?\u201d\nUruna is excessively stubborn today, arms crossed over her chest, eyeing me with my mother\u2019s eyes as if I\u2019ve done some unspeakable evil. I don\u2019t know what went wrong between us. Since that first day she never trusted me completely, never allowed me to help her.\nWhen she does not reply, I try to explain as calmly as I can. \u201cI told you it was very important to not retract anything. When we first met, I reassured you that with history such as yours, I can get you out of here. Yet you changed statements.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do now?\u201d she bursts. \u201cIt is what it is!\u201d\nI understand she\u2019s more embarrassed and angry at herself than she is at me. She feels alone in this, but truth is, she\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s terribly easy for the applicants to get confused during the long interviews. The rules are strict. One fake-sounding statement and you\u2019re all done.\nKatii isn\u2019t with us\u2014a friend is looking after him because he\u2019s feeling too weak today. And I can tell Uruna is anxious to return to the child, always turning her head towards the sounds and voices coming from the camp.\n\u201cYou are right,\u201d I admit. It\u2019s no use to keep this conversation going. My own guilt engulfs me: I was too ill to help her prepare. I didn\u2019t even join her at the interview. \u201cIt is what it is. I should have done my job better.\u201d\nAt my sharing of responsibility, Uruna loosens up. Her stubborn mask gives way into genuine distress and disappointment. Tears fill her eyes, but they\u2019re tears of anger. I remember angry tears. I used to cry of anger too. \u201cI told them many times over! How Katii has four parents, and so does everyone.\u201d She\u2019s making fists, spitting the words like fire. \u201cThey thought I was lying! Making up things about my parents and relatives. Because I said father and mother several times and they couldn\u2019t figure out who was who!\u201d\nExactly as I feared. Even though we rehearsed many times and made sure to clarify who did what, even though there are so many asylum seekers from Koohar right now, to Turm ears it all sounds like a hopelessly tangled ball of yarn. Even the most cooperative of the asylum officers, those who will patiently ask clarifications on who is who, might eventually find the account flawed and unconvincing.\nAlthough it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s not impossible to clear up this mess. The law allows us to ask for a second audience due to malpractice.\nThen Uruna surprises me, catching me off guard. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like Turm. You look more like us.\u201d\nWhile I was lost in my own thoughts she had been examining my face. We have the same sandy skin, the same wild curls, the same arched eyebrows. But I dye my hair and keep it sleek, pluck my eyebrows and hide my complexion under makeup. \u201cCan you tell?\u201d I laugh.\nShe points at my ears. No one ever wondered if there was anything wrong with my ears. But Uruna sees something others can\u2019t see. \u201cOnly esom have this ear-shape,\u201d she says.\nEsom. Child-bearing female. What I would have been. \u201cI am esom,\u201d I admit, a knowledge I took with me from Koohar. I was nine when I left, and the miniscule changes that split the two genders into four start at eight. \u201cBut for the Turm, it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m just a woman.\u201d\n\u201cWoman,\u201d Uruna says, pondering the word. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s better to be just woman.\u201d In my notes fed through the mini-com, I see you have translated the Luti word for girl. Woman does not exist on Koohar. \u201cWhat does it mean for adults?\u201d she asks, trying to understand people who stay a dyad and don\u2019t transform a second time. Suddenly, it is Uruna who\u2019s interviewing me and it\u2019s uneasy. This is one way applicants try to gain more control, even to manipulate. I should stay on top of this, yet I want to answer. I\u2019ve never talked about being esom with anyone after I left.\n\u201cIt means both potential child-bearer and raiser. Both soom and esom,\u201d I explain. \u201cThe Turm think that when you have children, you raise them too.\u201d\nShe laughs, but her laugh is tinged with disgust. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d\nI shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I won\u2019t have children. I can\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I was born like this or if my infertility is the aftermath of several things I\u2019ve been through during those days I wandered as a child around camps, loosely guarded camps, horrendously chaotic camps. The fate of loneliness this knowledge has sealed for me is something I do not think about.\nUruna\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cNaya!\u201d she says, but you won\u2019t translate this word. I check your translation notes from Luti language and they look empty: the entry is missing. Another Koohar thing too complex to translate? \u201cSir, I\u2019m looking this up,\u201d you whisper in my head.\nHer face softens, in distant sadness and a tiny bit of understanding. \u201cYou\u2019re so unlucky,\u201d she tells me and embarrassment consumes me. In Koohar, where people take so much pride in looking after the next generation whichever way they can, I\u2019m a child-bearer who\u2019s infertile\u2014what else could I receive except pity? Our little talk is getting dangerously out of hand. Then she asks what I\u2019ve been fearing all along: \u201cHow did you end up in Turm?\u201d\nBy now I know there\u2019s no way out of this. But maybe if I talk about myself she will start trusting me. Maybe it\u2019s the right moment to take her on my side. \u201cI was a refugee in the Two Systems War. Grew up in camps around the solar system. When I was eleven, a Turm family adopted me. I don\u2019t remember much of my life before.\u201d\n\u201cI remember Two Systems,\u201d Uruna says, \u201cI was five or six back then.\u201d Only now she must have realized how close we are, how many things connect us.\nI am mistaken. \u201cSo you\u2019re Turm,\u201d she announces her verdict. It hurts, but finally I have an answer to why she can\u2019t trust me. \u201cThrough and through,\u201d she twists the knife. \u201cYou ran to save yourself from the Turm, then they adopted you. Thought they were doing you a favor?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I am Turm,\u201d I say, uncertain how to deal with this. To the Koohari woman I represent Turm Empire. But to the Turm, I\u2019m still an orphan their own wars created, a mirror to the actions they tried to banish by giving me a second chance to live. \u201cBut I\u2019m also Koohari, from Antu,\u201d I assert, trying too late to gain control of the conversation, \u201cand I\u2019m here to help you. Will you trust me?\u201d\nThe frown returns on her face, the distraction that was my past having ended. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d she mutters. \u201cYou said you can\u2019t help me now.\u201d\n\u201cI can help,\u201d I say with confidence, clutching onto this little opening to drag myself back on top of the conversation. \u201cLook, the Station\u2019s in real trouble. They really want to remove from here as many of you as they can. We can ask for a second interview. Or if your application gets rejected we can always appeal. About the misunderstandings, we can justify them with memory gaps. There\u2019s always a solution. We will keep fighting. Okay?\u201d\nShe finally looks a little more convinced and promises to work with me to prepare a second interview. You assist us, translating and keeping notes, tiny red lights of worry betraying you.\nBeyond Uruna, I can see an arm. I close my eyes and it\u2019s still there.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t catch me,\u201d I say to myself. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\nLuciole. What is home?\nI wish I could tell you more about the rocky shores and the neranj spoon preserve, about the flocks of migratory sand-sparrows traveling the planet, chasing hot gusts of wind. I wish I could, but my memory is blown up in splinters and all I\u2019ve told you about rocky shores and neranj spoon preserves is all reconstructed things, all an effort to remember through pictures and video footage and music. Something I decided to do on my own when I was in college and took an elective on the geopolitics and culture of the system Koohar\u2019s in. Koohar is still a foreign land to me; a foreign land that\u2019s running in my veins.\n\u201cSir. They are asking you to return to Oonti.\u201d\nHow could I not be grateful when they took me, an orphan refugee, to grow up as part of a middle-class Turm family? To have food and shelter and two parents. Access to education and a much-coveted Turm citizenship. My Koohar name was forgotten; I was a new person now. I walked the silver-gray streets of Oonti to my school, studied calculus and the language of the Empire. Koohar was the place where bodies were blown up by bombs. Where my mother died. Where disembodied arms could be found on the ground on your way back home from school. Where home does not exist anymore.\n\u201cYou can choose to stay if you want. If you don\u2019t, they will send someone else.\u201d\nMemory gaps are very real, Luciole. A psychologist told me once that trauma is like a giant metal ball and memory is a tiny glass one. When trauma drops onto memory, it shatters it into such tiny fragments, that days and moments get hopelessly mixed up, that your sixth birthday ends up next to the day they killed your father and you can\u2019t tell the story differently because you don\u2019t know how it really happened, not anymore. They say brain surgery can fix these things now. But who in their right mind would choose to bring back fragments of memories that are hidden and forgotten? Let the song of sand-sparrows wither in my memory if the whistling song of bombs might fade too.\nMy mother\u2019s eyes and hands, my brother\u2019s scraped knees, the sweet and sour taste of flower cakes and the feel of cool saltwater under my toes. I thought those memories were gone forever. Now that Koohar\u2019s almost destroyed, they\u2019re coming back to me\u2014refugees themselves, fleeing.\n\u201cI think you should take this opportunity, sir. You\u2019ve done as much as you can here.\u201d\nCould it be because I talk to you of home all the time that home keeps returning to me? Are you the one storing those memories, wrapping them into a soft cocoon of spit thread, and nurturing them into moths and butterflies?\nIf exiles can\u2019t dream of home then how can they keep on living?\nThe wide universe around us feels colder today.\nI\u2019m meeting with Uruna at my office again. I wish there were places to take her, places to see, but Uruna is not allowed out of the camp. We\u2019re sitting in a prison within a prison.\n\u201cWhat do you mean Katii is gone?\u201d I blink at her, trying to make sense out of your translated words.\nShe looks embarrassed, yet her jaw is set, unrepentant, her eyes fixed somewhere beyond me where I can never see. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait. The application takes such a long time . . . And C-Doctors have no medication for my child. They say they\u2019ve run out of supplies.\u201d\n\u201cWhere is your child, Uruna?\u201d I ask again, hoping to hear something a little less terrible than what I have in mind.\n\u201cI sent him to inner Turm,\u201d she mutters, this time meeting my eyes. I know she will defend her choice to the end. \u201cThey won\u2019t deny Katii treatment there.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d I insist. \u201cSmugglers? They\u2019re on Sandpiper?\u201d\nShe nods. \u201cThey made the passport. And said it\u2019s easier for me to get sent there later on, if Katii is there alone. Other people told me the same thing. That it\u2019s the law and can\u2019t be changed. This will help the application. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\nHer accusing question at the end leaves me stunned. Again, she\u2019s making an enemy out of me. How could I have been so stupid, to not warn her about smugglers? \u201cUruna . . . no,\u201d I try to explain. \u201cSmugglers lie because they want your money. This is the law, yes, that families ought to reunite. But it\u2019s not easy. It never happens. Maybe one person in thousand.\u201d\nShe licks her lips, her frown deepens. She\u2019s only starting to realize what she has done. \u201cBut it\u2019s the law. Why don\u2019t they apply it?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the law is vague and asks for hundreds of other things to grant you protection,\u201d I say. By now, my words have turned into whispers. My own will has been sapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? The law wasn\u2019t made to bring you in. It was meant to keep you out.\u201d\nConfusion, then understanding. She knows she\u2019s made a big mistake and I don\u2019t wish to aggravate her guilt for leaving her sick child alone. Katii is floating somewhere among the stars. She sets her eyes on one of them, where she hopes her child might have a better life.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to wait,\u201d she says, tears in her voice. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll be the one in a thousand.\u201d\nI\u2019m holding my breath. \u201cHow much did you pay?\u201d I ask quietly.\n\u201cAll I had. Not enough to go with him.\u201d She turns to look at me again, suspicion back on her face. \u201cMaasa said your company wants to take you back home. Will you leave us then?\u201d\nNews travels fast. I haven\u2019t decided yet. \u201cWhat? Of course I won\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m lying, but there\u2019s nothing else I can say. \u201cI will do my best, Uruna. If he reaches inner Turm safely, then we can track Katii\u2019s whereabouts. We can even communicate. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d\nAt last, she sinks her cheeks into her hands. As she is weeping quietly, I recognize it\u2014calloused joints, burned fingertips, patches of dried blood. The arm is here again. Maybe it will stay with her, leaving me in peace at last.\n\u201cDo you ever want to go back?\u201d she asks, wiping her eyes and nose. \u201cNot Turm. Koohar. You left too young. Almost an age with Katii.\u201d Worry, concern. I think the distance between us has started bridging itself. Too late, but it has.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember much,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut maybe.\u201d Yes.\nShe shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone now. The land is ruined. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d I keep silent; I don\u2019t know what to say. For both of us, Koohar can only live in memories now. \u201cI thought you were Turm and hated you. Then noticed you\u2019re Koohar and hated you more. You look and act everything Turm. How could I trust you?\u201d\nI nod. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cBut all I want for Katii now is to live and grow up in inner Turm, somewhere nice.\u201d She meets my eyes again, an honest shine in them\u2014my mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cLike you did. Look at you. You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d I don\u2019t want to ruin her illusion that I\u2019m doing fine. She will have no hope left if I do that. \u201cMaybe an adoptive family would be good. He will turn Turm, yes. But maybe he won\u2019t forget his poor mother. Do you remember yours?\u201d\nHope. With a pang I realize that my poor self that she pitied the other day, was hope to her, to her child. I survived, even as a product of a system that had tried to destroy me. Still, I survived.\n\u201cI thought I had forgotten her,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you look so much like her.\u201d\nShe nods, accepting my words. \u201cNell. What was your Koohar name? Do you remember?\u201d\n\u201cI do. My mother called me Nuruli.\u201d\n\u201cNuruli.\u201d Sand-sparrow. \u201cWhat a fine name to remind one of home. Want me to talk to you about Antu?\u201d\nI nod. So I sit and listen to the woman with my mother\u2019s eyes, to that generous gift she\u2019s giving me. As she speaks I blink through the haze and the arm, for once, is nowhere to be seen. I know it still sits somewhere inside me, merged with parts of me, entirely unrecognizable now.\nLuciole. Have I ever told you about the camps? About how small joys flowered in the midst of misery?\n\u201cSir, you\u2019re too pale. Have a seat. Drink some water.\u201d\nThe air is thick with human smells and sharp with cold. My breath is crafting crystals in the air. I\u2019m here to help, but I can barely help myself, Luciole.\n\u201cShe sent Katii off,\u201d I mutter. \u201cI hope I won\u2019t lose her too. She looks ready to jump ship any moment now.\u201d\n\u201cShe does look a little hard to pin down,\u201d you say, unimpressed. \u201cBut it\u2019s not your fault, sir. So . . . you\u2019re staying to help her?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d I know you\u2019re disapproving, Luciole, I know you do. Like a mother and a father, you keep hoping for me to make the decision that\u2019s hurting me least. I change the topic quickly. \u201cI have a gift for you,\u201d I say. The poetry data disk was the best one I could find on Sandpiper, although a little shabby for someone so knowledgeable as you.\nThe explosion of colorful lights speaks to me of your joy, even as you say, cynically, \u201cAh. Thank you, sir. Poetry is useless, though.\u201d\n\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\nYou are already copying the disk, scanning through the text. \u201cAll poetry can do is dig graves for the things that are left unmourned.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that is useless?\u201d\nI can read satisfaction coming from you. \u201cYou understand poetry then, sir.\u201d\nYou pour me some tea and I can hear a faint humming as you go through the poetry passages, carefully curating your favorites. My fingers soften around the hot mug. Moments of peace amidst chaos are sometimes the only thing we can hold onto.\n\u201cSir, I found a translation for naya, remember? Naya are blessed in Koohar.\u201d\nI shake my head. \u201cI would be an embarrassment to my mother had she lived to see me grow up.\u201d\n\u201cYou are mistaken, sir. Naya are childless women. They help everyone, keep knowledge. They are the greatest poets ever known. It\u2019s very rare, to be of fifth nature. You would have guided the Koohari well, back home.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that,\u201d I cough. Your words strike me. There is so much I don\u2019t know about Koohar. \u201cThen why did Uruna call me unlucky?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you were chased out. Never had the chance to be what you would have been. Doesn\u2019t it make sense?\u201d Your ability to use logic so aptly is a skill I covet. You cease your scanning through the poetry data, focus all attention on me. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good idea to stay here, sir. Become naya.\u201d\n\u201cI know nothing. I remember nothing.\u201d The harsh reality of my words is crushing me. The feeling of helplessness has never, ever truly left me. \u201cThere\u2019s so little I can do. I\u2019m as trapped as everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYou survived once,\u201d you assert. \u201cYou already know how to do it. That\u2019s precious data you have there.\u201d\nIs it? How did I do it? At what cost? I don\u2019t know. Surviving becomes reflex. Uruna and Katii know it too.\nLuciole, how can we go on without exile? We, who live by the ever-changing horizon fixed in our eyes, the place we always long to go but never can. We, who live by orbit alone, always at a distance and with nowhere else to go.\nI close my eyes and the arm is still somewhere there. But behind it I see other shapes, lingering in their larval dreams, waiting to be born.\n\u201cTalk to me of home, Luciole.\u201d\nYou blink at me, electric eyes of warm light. Something in the world is changing, flowering, as much as it\u2019s flowering in me. \u201cOf the home you lost, or the home you\u2019ll build?\u201d\n\u201cOf the place we\u2019ll always return to.\u201d\nEleanna Castroianni is a writer, poet and oral storyteller from Greece.

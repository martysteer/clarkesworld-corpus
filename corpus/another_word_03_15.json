Shed does not sound appealing. It conjures a certain image: a lawn mower, a snow blower, a gasoline smell, mouse poop.\n It sounds like a place one might be banished to\u2014a punitive measure for having done something wrong. \u201cYou\u2019re stinking up the joint with your WORD FUMES,\u201d my wife might say. \u201cTo the shed with you! With the mice and the mowers!\u201d And then I would stumble the long march across the hoarfrost lawn to the shed where I would toil away the hours with blister-making, callus-having wordsmithy. Rattling shovels and letting spiders weave webs in my hair.\n We have a shed like that.\n I am not writing this from that shed.\n Rather, I am writing from a whole different shed.\n I am writing from my writing shed.\n Let\u2019s step back a moment.\n A writer must do one thing above all else, and that is: to write.\n That, of course, is easier said than done. I might as well have said, \u201cA writer must do one thing above all else, and that is: to wrestle four grizzly bears into submission.\u201d\n To write, other things must fall into place.\n A writer must have:\n a) time\n and\n b) place.\n Meaning, you have to be able to snatch time away from the jaws of the same time-consuming beast that attacks us all, and you must also secure some place somewhere to actually sit and write. You can\u2019t do it all in your head. Not yet, at least (the technology hasn\u2019t caught up to the psychic dimension).\n Time management is a whole issue all its own and instead, I\u2019d like to talk about place. Whether you use a notebook or a laptop computer, whether you sit at a desktop or carve your manifestos into the back of a captive UPS man, whether you sit on a Bosu ball or stand at a treadmill desk, you must find the literal, physical space to commit your wordsmithy.\n And it\u2019s not just about having the space. It\u2019s about having a protected, special space. A space without intrusion from others. A place suited to the ideation and creation of the work you want to commit to paper and screen.\n That brings us to: the shed.\n I\u2019ve been a writer for\u2014\n *checks watch*\n Too many years, now. I freelanced for over ten years, and I\u2019ve been writing novels for the last few. All the while, I\u2019ve been afforded some manner of office inside the walls of our home. An office with a desk, a computer, bookshelves, and whatever else I felt was necessary to get the story juices flowing (at various points: snacks, liquor, coffee, Star Wars toys, pens, ninja weapons, coffee). It\u2019s been wonderful. I\u2019ve been very lucky. I had a place to call my own. Not a big space. I couldn\u2019t drive a Segway around it to clear my head. No hang-gliding amongst its rafters.\n But I had four walls and a ceiling and a light and it was mine.\n Then, not quite four years ago, this thing happened. An event.\n A cataclysm, of sorts.\n We were suddenly host to this thing known as a \u201chuman child.\u201d\n It came from my wife, though if I\u2019m to understand the biology, I too am equally responsible. Whoever created this thing, he\u2019s here. He\u2019s on this planet. And we are his caretakers despite not having signed up specifically for this task.\n He\u2019s wonderful. We love him dearly. The boy is a ball of kooky, kinetic energy.\n At first, he was fairly still. You could pick him up and put him down someplace else and, for the most part, there he would remain. But if there\u2019s one thing I have learned about children it\u2019s that they\u2019re very much like the scene in Jurassic Park where the velociraptors learn to open doors. They continue to learn and grow and advance and that means metaphorically learning to open doors and also literally learning to open doors.\n One day they stay where you plop them.\n Next thing you know, they\u2019re running around your house at top speed like a coyote on bath salts.\n Now, being a writer is a fairly intellectual pursuit. I sit still most days like some kind of crafty fungus, and my fingers do most of the moving, and they do that moving in order to translate the pure, unfiltered story in my mind onto the screen. Doing that takes a lot of concentration. Mental energy and effort. You gotta sit down, focus up, and use that brain-bucket to make thinky-thinky.\n Ah, but having the drug-addled coyote running around?\n It . . . complicates things.\n My wife can only do so much to wrangle a three-year-old. He\u2019s like a zombie attack, that kid. Just when you think you\u2019re safe\u2014the doorknob is rattling, someone is moaning on the other side of the wall, and little fingers are grabbing underneath the door in the hopes of grabbing you and dragging you out of the safety of your room. Just as I\u2019d start to get into a groove with my work\u2014\n Here comes the zombie-coyote-velociraptor.\n Always welcome! Always sweet! He\u2019d come in and want hugs and want to play or want to tell me some completely absurd story he just made up. It was nice.\n And it was hell on my productivity.\n I had deadlines, damnit.\n They call them deadlines because if you don\u2019t meet \u2018em? You\u2019re dead.\n So, my wife and I sat down and said, something must be done.\n We considered putting the child in a box marked FREE PANDA and putting it out on the curb, but turns out? That\u2019s illegal. (Stupid government.) Since exile for the human child would not be an option, I would be the one to take exile.\n Various ideas were bandied about. Rent an office? Refurbish a part of the house where I could hide away like some freakish uncle everyone thinks is in prison?\n Or, seize upon the trend of: studio office sheds.\n Ah-ha.\n We talked to some local Amish shed-builders and it turns out, you can get one built and have it fitted for things like: electricity! And HVAC! And whiskey dispensers!\n That\u2019s what we did, and now here I am, writing this article from the writing shed. A place I sometimes call \u201cthe Mystery Box,\u201d though a Facebook friend online came up with the name \u201cthe Myth Lab,\u201d which is probably much cooler if there wasn\u2019t a risk my son would go to school one day and tell his teacher \u201cDaddy works in a Myth Lab,\u201d but of course they wouldn\u2019t hear Myth Lab, and suddenly everyone would think my son\u2019s father was some Heisenberg variant making meth in a shed.\n You probably don\u2019t have a shed.\n You may never have a writing shed. I never expected to need one or have one.\n What you will need, and what I want you to think very hard about, is finding a place to call your own.\n I want you to find this place somewhere in your life. It can be in public, though it\u2019s much better it is space you legitimately own and control. You cannot own that corner of Starbucks, much as you want to. You cannot own that park bench or guarantee its use every time you pass by it.\n This is your idea chamber.\n This is your worldbuilding, wordbuilding realm.\n This is your land and you are the deity that presides over it.\n Maybe this is a room in your house. Or a desk in your bedroom. Or a laptop that you can set up at the kitchen table. Big or small, it is yours.\n Now: I want you to protect this space with tooth and claw. Because part of being a writer is making writing a priority. If it\u2019s not important to you, it won\u2019t be important to anyone else. If it\u2019s a thing that matters to you in your heart, sometimes you need to make it matter outside in reality. You need to tell people in your life:\n This is my space.\n For a period of time, I require this space to do what matters to me.\n Protect the time you have to use it.\n Since entering the shed, my productivity has gone way up.\n I write a lot more now.\n I find this is true any time I take what I do more seriously.\n If I give my writing its priority, then my writing returns to me with productivity.\n Do the same for yourself.\n Find your space.\n Stake your claim.\n Shed or no shed, find your place.\n Make it matter.\n And no, you can\u2019t have my shed. Get your own space, weirdo.\n Chuck Wendig is a novelist, screenwriter and game designer.

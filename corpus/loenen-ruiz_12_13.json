They had gone to an exhibit celebrating the removal of the barrier between Central City and Metal Town. He remembered feeling proud. His mom, after all, had played a key role in building bridges between the two worlds and if not for her efforts, the barrier would still be there.\n \u201cThere\u2019s someone I want to introduce you to,\u201d his mother said.\n He\u2019d registered the peak in her voice that could mean excitement or trepidation, but before he could feel anything himself, they were being welcomed into a circle of metal men.\n \u201cThis must be your son,\u201d someone said. \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to meet you. I hear you\u2019re quite the Adventure Boy.\u201d\n A hand was extended to him, and he looked up. Light glinted off Mechanic\u2019s domed head and Adventure Boy picked up the static threaded through his voice. An unrelenting old-timer, he\u2019d thought.\n \u201cWell,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cwon\u2019t you shake my hand? I assure you, shaking hands with me won\u2019t turn you into a metal can.\u201d\n It was the hidden taunt that prompted him to reach out and clasp Mechanic\u2019s hand in his. He noted the temperature of metal against his skin, but where he\u2019d expected cold, Mechanic\u2019s hand was warm. \u201cI may be old,\u201d Mechanic said, \u201cbut I\u2019m still upgradeable.\u201d\n The other metal men laughed and Adventure Boy registered signals of relief from his mother.\n \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you, sir,\u201d Adventure Boy said. He didn\u2019t know what else to say because he\u2019d never heard of Mechanic and he didn\u2019t know why his mother felt it was important for this man to like him.\n After that introduction, his mother was summoned by Central City\u2019s governor and Adventure Boy was left to wander the exhibit on his own.\n Here were replicas of a life he\u2019d never known. Photographs and reliquaries that meant nothing at all to him. They were part of his mother\u2019s long ago life, not his. He had come to awareness in Central City, and he only knew this place with its smooth asphalt, ordered subdivisions and neatly manicured front lawns.\n The photographs made him wonder though. He stared at captured images of piles of rusted metal, disembodied machines, and deserted buildings and he couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it had been like when his mother still lived there.\n \u201cYou should visit it someday,\u201d a voice said behind him.\n It was Mechanic. His hands neatly folded behind his back, his eyes directed at the replica of a building called the Remembrance Monument.\n \u201cOf course, the streets are silent now,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cWe\u2019re being integrated into Central City\u2019s workforce and there\u2019s no need to maintain the workshops and the shelters. It\u2019s a foolish fancy that none of us are allowed, but if you stand directly under the Remembrance Monument, you can still hear the whisper of voices from those who\u2019ve gone before.\u201d\n \u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d Adventure Boy asked. \u201cI don\u2019t belong there at all.\u201d\n Mechanic inclined his head. His face was blank, in the way metal men\u2019s faces were blank. But Adventure Boy couldn\u2019t help feeling as if he\u2019d hurt the metal man somehow.\n \u201cI mean, I was born here,\u201d Adventure Boy said. \u201cI\u2019m a citizen of this place. Also, Metal Town is no more, so . . . \u201d\n His voice trailed off as Mechanic stepped away.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cThis is your city. I hope you enjoy the exhibit. It was good to meet you, Adventure Boy.\u201d\n As he watched Mechanic walk away, he couldn\u2019t help but feel as if he\u2019d done a great wrong.\n \n An alternate child will be a good addition to your home. Memomach industries works to create the perfect child to suit your needs.\n \u2014Memomach Industry ad\u2014\n \n He remembered the time he was refused a place on the school softball team. He listened to the soft-voiced principal as she tried to explain it to him.\n Alternates were different. They could run faster. They had more stamina. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to the children of the makers.\n In time, he learned not to want. He tried to blend in. He was, after all, his mother\u2019s child. In his second year at school, another alternate child transferred in. He tried not to speak to the other, and the other did not speak to him. They sat side by side on a bench watching the others play, not speaking a word.\n It would have gone on that way if not for another transfer. Unlike them, Jill Slowbloom was noisy. She laughed loud and she made jokes. She was clumsy as well.\n \u201cMy parents said they wanted the perfect child,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they meant the perfect child for them.\u201d\n Her laughter drew them out of their shells. They were no longer two, but three, and when the term ended and another alternate transferred in, they became four.\n \u201cWe could start our own club,\u201d Jill said.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be point. Eileen will notate. And you and Jeff can follow my lead.\u201d\n For a while, he felt like he belonged somewhere. Then the new term ended. Jill transferred out. Eileen moved away. He and Jeff were left staring at each other, not knowing how to fill the silence that was left behind.\n Perhaps, he thinks. Perhaps if I go to Metal Town, I will find the words to fill the silence. Perhaps I will understand more.\n Father wears the face of a numbered man. He wears the suit, he carries the briefcase, he drives the car.\n At home, he morphs into someone who Mother argues with over their dinner.\n \u201cI don\u2019t see why you feel the need to indulge him,\u201d Mother says.\n \u201cMechanic thinks it will be good for him, and I agree,\u201d Father replies.\n They are discussing Adventure Boy\u2019s desire to visit Metal Town.\n Mother doesn\u2019t wish them to go, but Father sees no harm in it.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want to see that place again,\u201d Mother says. \u201cI shudder when I remember how I almost lost you there.\u201d\n \u201cBut you didn\u2019t lose me,\u201d Father says. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t deny him this. If he wants to know it for himself, then he should know it for himself.\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t go,\u201d Mother says.\n \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go, you don\u2019t have to go,\u201d Father replies.\n Adventure Boy lies on his back and stares up at the ceiling. He had bought a picture of the Remembrance Monument and Father had hung it up. At night, the lines of the monument glowed in the dark.\n Mechanic\u2019s words rang in his ear.\n \u201cYou can still hear the voices of those who have gone before.\u201d\n \n Come reminisce of days gone by . . .\n Metal Town Tours, your official tourist operator. We provide detailed excursions, maps, and access to some of Metal Town\u2019s most spectacular monuments.\n \u2014Metal Town Tours ad\u2014\n \n Smooth asphalt morphed into rough tarmac and the neatly ordered lawns of suburbia were replaced with fields full of high grass and wild sunflowers with faces turned towards the sky.\n Father had rented a tour car; it was decorated with yellow sunflowers and bold black lettering announcing the name of the official tour agency.\n They were the only visitors so far. It was a Saturday and most tourists came in after twelve.\n Adventure Boy rolled down the window. A light morning breeze caused goosebumps to rise on the surface of his skin. But after that initial contact, his skin warmed and they vanished.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a much smoother ride than I remember,\u201d Father said.\n Adventure Boy turned to look at him.\n Without his suit, Father looked like one of the makers. His face was not as rigid, his shoulders were relaxed and he wore a plain t-shirt and jeans just like all the other fathers Adventure Boy saw at school.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never talked about it,\u201d Father said. \u201cBut Metal Town is a painful memory for your mother. She came to consciousness here. She loved it and yet she wanted nothing more than to escape it.\u201d\n \u201cIs this where you two met?\u201d Adventure Boy asked.\n Father smiled.\n \u201cYou could say that,\u201d he said.\n There was a pause and then Father said, \u201cIt was here that I brought her into being.\u201d\n \n With the unification of Metal Town and the Central City, Metal Town\u2019s dwellers were promptly absorbed into the general workforce. Metal Town soon became redundant.\n Proposals for the renovation of Metal Town are ongoing, but until then, it has been kept in its original state for the sake of those who wish to revisit an important part of the reunification history.\n \u2014Recorded guide from Metal Town Tours\u2014\n \n \u201cThese were my quarters,\u201d Father said.\n They stopped before a cluster of buildings. Adventure Boy noted the signs of decay on the metal scaffolds that kept the buildings together.\n Father stood at the foot of the one of the houses. It was washed in gray, its shutters were wide open and one of them looked out at a field of sunflowers.\n \u201cDo you want to go inside?\u201d Father said.\n \n What precautions were carried out to preserve experiments from being stolen or taken away? This house, which holds the tools of a master maker, was secured with a special reader that identified visitors through codes implanted in their optic lenses.\n \u2014From Guide to Metal Town\u2014\n \n \u201cIt\u2019s still here,\u201d Father said.\n Was that amusement in his voice? Father stooped, and Adventure Boy saw it. A small screen was set into the doorjamb.\n \u201cTry it,\u201d Father said.\n Adventure Boy bent down and pressed his eye to the screen. Nothing moved. The door didn\u2019t budge.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Father replied.\n He bent down and pressed his eye to the screen. There was a flash of green and a click.\n \u201cI can\u2019t believe they haven\u2019t put that out of commission,\u201d Father said.\n With a push, the door swung open and Adventure Boy was assailed with the smell of liquid oil, and the essence his mother took once every fourteen days.\n \u201cIs this . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Father said. \u201cHere is where your mother became aware.\u201d\n The open window looked out on the sunflower fields. He tried to bring up an image of his mother. He remembered the moment when he first came to awareness. He remembered her voice echoing within the confines of the room that became his own.\n \u201cHe\u2019s not waking up.\u201d It was a soundbite from the past.\n \u201cBe patient,\u201d Father\u2019s voice. \u201cWaking up takes time. You should know this very well.\u201d\n \u201cBut if I failed . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou have not failed,\u201d Father again.\n He\u2019d opened his eyes, and the room came into being. Walls of powdered gray and the smell of oil and essence pervading the air.\n Then Mother\u2019s face was in his vision.\n \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she said. Relief colored her voice. \u201cWelcome to the world, Adventure Boy.\u201d\n \n One of the archived stories is that of an early alternate. Created to be the perfect housewife, this alternate was so designed that it could easily pass as one of the makers.\n There is no exact record of her progress.\n \u2014Metal Town Tours\u2014\n \n \u201cWere you happy?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cShe was as I envisioned she would be,\u201d Father said. \u201cAn alternate girl who was also quite human.\u201d\n \u201cI know she is as you wanted her to be,\u201d Adventure Boy said. \u201cBut, were you happy?\u201d\n \u201cI am happier now,\u201d Father said. \u201cShe broke her program, just as she was meant to. She became herself.\u201d\n Outside was warmer. It was mid-morning. They had been in Metal Town for less than an hour, but to Adventure Boy it was as if he had been there for a lifetime.\n They parked the touring car close to the center.\n \u201cIt\u2019s good to walk,\u201d Father said.\n And like that they walked into the shadow of the Remembrance Monument.\n Remember.\n A voice whispered through his circuits. He thought of the moment when he met Mechanic, the warm and solid grip of Mechanic\u2019s hand and the urgency that rushed through him in that moment.\n I want to see.\n The thought rushed through him.\n He stood there, looking up at the huge monolith that housed the harvested memories from the hundreds of thousands of Metal Town\u2019s dwellers.\n Urgency flooded him. He wanted to run. He wanted to hide. He wanted to . . .\n He blinked and he was surrounded by warmth.\n Remember.\n Tiny little pinpricks filtered through his consciousness. He was seeing and yet not seeing. The landscape shifted. He was inside of the monument and he was outside of it.\n Father\u2019s eyes were closed as well. His mouth hanging open as if he were suspended halfway to speech.\n He shut his eyes and saw a vision. The tarmac buckled beneath him, the sunflower fields hemmed him about, and behind him was the roar of the Equilibrium Machine. Its bellow shook the air and he trembled. That great maw would consume him, would crush him, would take him down into recycling and a loss of all that he had come to love.\n Despair consumed him.\n And then she was there.\n Mother. Her eyes flashing bright, her voice ringing in the air around him.\n When he came back into himself, they were sitting at the foot of the monument. He wasn\u2019t at all surprised to see Mechanic speaking with his father.\n \n There are consequences for every choice we make. Be sure you understand before you make a decision.\n \u2014Mechanic, Words to the Wise, 14th ed. Ilay Press\u2014\n \n \n Heritage can be a burden. History can be a burden. Everything can be a burden if we choose to make it so.\n \u2014Mechanic, Words to the Wise, 14th ed. Ilay Press\u2014\n \n Mother never asked about their visit.\n They came home and they went on as if they had never been to Metal Town. From time to time, he would dream, but he woke before he started crying.\n \u201cBack in the day, my memory would be fed to the monument,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cBut government has decreed that we can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n \u201cThis body grows old,\u201d Mechanic continued.\n They sat there listening to whispers that they couldn\u2019t understand.\n \u201cI had to modulate your receptors a bit,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cYour systems would have broken down without intervention.\u201d\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Adventure Boy said.\n Father didn\u2019t say anything. He simply sat there, his head cupped in his hands.\n \u201cMemory is difficult,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cWe all live with the recollection of who we were. Your mother rescued your father. Theirs was an unusual situation. I didn\u2019t think they would try to create another exactly like her.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not like her,\u201d Adventure Boy said.\n \u201cI know,\u201d Mechanic replied.\n There was a pause and then the metal man turned to look at him and Adventure Boy could have sworn he smiled.\n \u201cYou\u2019re like me,\u201d he said.\n The next time he saw Mechanic, it was at the unveiling of the new government\u2019s plan for Metal Town\u2019s rehabilitation.\n He had grown into a new body. This one was taller and broader than his twelve year old one. He was living on his own now, earning a living as a regular Adventure Boy.\n \u201cFeeding the dreams of the masses,\u201d a voice said behind him.\n He looked down into Mechanic\u2019s upturned face.\n \u201cYou may change,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t forget an imprint.\u201d\n The governor had come onstage and was giving the usual speech.\n \u201cHow old are you now?\u201d Adventure Boy asked.\n Mechanic cackled before he replied.\n \u201cOlder than you. Older than your mother. Older than your father. Almost as old as the Monument they want to tear down.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re an alternate, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cSurely, you\u2019re listening to what the governor is saying.\u201d\n It was true.\n \u201cRedundant buildings,\u201d the governor was saying.\n As if those words were enough of a verdict.\n \u201cRelics of a bygone era,\u201d the governor continued. \u201cBut we must move on. We must move forward.\u201d\n He could hear cheers coming from makers and alternates alike.\n \u201cBut what about the memories?\u201d Adventure Boy couldn\u2019t help asking.\n Mechanic shrugged.\n It was all the answer he needed.\n \n We are always unraveling threads as we strive to weave them together. We think we can move towards tomorrow without yesterday. We forget that yesterday gives us the courage for today, and yesterday is the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s dream.\n \u2014Mechanic to Adventure Boy\u2014\n \n \n Records show that our model children grow up to become model citizens. These are the kinds of citizens we need as we look towards our joined futures.\n \u2014Government statement on the creation of alternate children\u2014\n \n It hadn\u2019t been all that difficult to find them. Awkward Jill had turned into a climber. Eileen created metal art. Jeff surprised him most of all. The silent boy played music in a club frequented by metal men.\n What was not surprising\u2014they had all sat under the shadow of the Remembrance Monument.\n \u201cIt\u2019s as if it was calling to us,\u201d Jill said.\n He couldn\u2019t keep from staring when a smile bloomed on Jeff\u2019s face. It was the first time he\u2019d seen anything like it.\n \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be model citizens,\u201d Eileen said dryly. \u201cSome would say you were planning anarchy.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be risky,\u201d Adventure Boy said.\n \u201cWe know,\u201d Jill replied. \u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to Eileen. It\u2019s just how she is.\u201d\n \u201cIf we\u2019re found out, there\u2019s no telling what they\u2019d do to us,\u201d Adventure Boy went on.\n \u201cYou only live once,\u201d Jeff said.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if this plan will even work,\u201d Adventure Boy added. \u201cAnd you do know we could all end up being recycled.\u201d\n \u201cNothing tried, nothing gained,\u201d Eileen replied.\n \u201cYou guys . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re planning something,\u201d Father said.\n He looked up from the console he was working on.\n \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d he said.\n \u201cRemember what you are meant to be,\u201d Father said.\n \u201cI\u2019ll remember,\u201d he replied.\n His father\u2019s words hid a message.\n This is between you and me, it said.\n The days were hectic and short. Word was that the government was accepting bids from demolition teams.\n \u201cWe have to do it soon,\u201d Jill said.\n No one would suspect them. Four alternates could not shut down the plans of a city. But they had to try.\n When Mechanic showed up at his door, he didn\u2019t know whether to be angry or thankful or sorry.\n \u201cI hear you might be planning something foolish,\u201d Mechanic said.\n Adventure Boy crossed his arms and stared down at the metal man. When he was twelve, Mechanic had seemed larger than life. He still had substance, but Adventure Boy no longer feared him.\n \u201cAre you here to stop me?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cDo you want to be stopped?\u201d Mechanic said.\n He uncrossed his arms and looked Mechanic straight in the eyes.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\n \n For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n \u2014Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion\u2014\n \n \n \u201cMy son has plans. I don\u2019t know what because he hasn\u2019t told me. But he is also his mother\u2019s son.\u201d\n \u2014Father to Mechanic\u2014\n \n \u201cYou are your mother\u2019s child,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cShe was also fearless even when afraid.\u201d\n \u201cShe has no part in this,\u201d Adventure Boy replied.\n \u201cBut she has,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cSome part of you was born from her memory of Metal Town and the Remembrance Monument.\u201d\n Adventure Boy shrugged. He had already ensured that his mother would escape any repercussions. Also, she was well-respected and known for her collaboration with the government. Surely, she would survive his actions with little damage to the reputation she\u2019d worked so hard to build up.\n \u201cEven she could not foresee this,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cWe mold our creations into our idea of what they should be like, but we also give you the ability to break that mold. Your mother is an example of this.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Adventure Boy demanded.\n \u201cYour mother fitted you well, but there are things you have yet to learn,\u201d Mechanic said. \u201cPlease. Allow me to lend you my strength.\u201d\n \n Where are you going? Where do you come from? Where are you now? Who are you? Who do you know? What do you want to achieve?\n \u2014Life Questions, Guide to Finding your own Path, Mackay and Manay\u2014\n \n Mechanic lists down names and numbers, formulas, addresses, and contact points.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Adventure Boy asks.\n \u201cThere are things you can do with a small army,\u201d Mechanic says. \u201cBut there are things you can do better when you spread your net wide.\u201d\n Adventure Boy has no words to speak his thanks. He watches Mechanic\u2019s fingers as they type out messages on different screens. The words change in formulation, but the message is all the same.\n I am calling in a favor.I need your help.Remember the bonds we share.Remember.Remember.Remember.\n Adventure Boy understands what those words mean now. He understands why he cannot allow the erasure of accumulated memory. No matter how insignificant or how unimportant those memories may seem, no matter that Metal Town is deemed obsolete, he can\u2019t allow those memories or those dreams to vanish without a trace.\n \u201cHere\u2019s how we planned to do it,\u201d he says to Mechanic.\n They huddle around the table, four alternates and a metal man whose time is coming to an end. Beneath their hands, their dream of the future takes shape. Adventure Boy sees it as a network of roads flourishing, Jeff sees it limned in light going on into eternity, Eileen sees it as a fan unfolding again and again and again in limitless space, and Jill sees it as a flower that blossoms and blossoms and blossoms over and over again.\n It is the vision they bring to the table\u2014this promise of a future filled with the dreams and the memories of those who have gone before.\n \n There can be no true reconciliation without acceptance.

No one notices the movement, but slowly it spreads. Here and there, the earth shakes. Memory rises and people start to talk in sentences that start with: Remember when.\n Memory becomes a living thing.\n As the heat of summer washes over Central City and its dwellers swelter in the shade, what started as a small droplet grows bigger and bigger until it takes the shape of a summer storm that rattles the windows and doors and washes away the heat.\n In the quiet fragrance that follows, memory blooms and with it the vision of a tomorrow.\n \n Alternate Ambassador Saunders has purchased a parcel of land in Metal Town.

It also boasts an acreage of wild sunflowers.\n \u2014Central City News Network\u2014\n \n \n In a startling new trend, Remembrance Monuments are being established in the first four wards of Central City. Open to Makers and to Alternates alike, the Remembrance Monuments are meant to house memories both personal as well as public.\n In the section open to public viewing, memorabilia is displayed that depicts the progress of Makers and Alternates alike. An interactive timeline allows viewers to enter the stream of thought. This kind of exchange is a first in Central City. It is hoped that this endeavor will further interpersonal relationships as well as preserve the history of the times.\n \u2014Central City News Network\u2014\n \n \u201cThere are no more borders,\u201d Alternate Girl says.\n She has come to visit Adventure Boy on the eve of reunited Metal Town\u2019s inauguration. For the past six months, she has endured a storm of demands. Critics have accused her of everything from being regressive to being senile.\n But everywhere, the alternates were rising. They refused to be silenced. They refused to allow Metal Town to be forgotten.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not yet as I would like it to be,\u201d Adventure Boy replies.\n \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not,\u201d his mother replies. \u201cIf you were so easily satisfied, you would not be my child.\u201d\n In the silence that falls between them, there is a kinship closer than any Adventure Boy has felt before.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy did you make me?\u201d\n \u201cBecause,\u201d she says, \u201ceven if I want to forget, someone needs to remember.\u201d\n He turns to her, and his puzzlement turns to understanding. In the palm of her hand she holds a chip. It has the marks of wear on it, but its casing is still golden.\n \u201cYou know whose it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I made you, he was also in my thoughts.\u201d\n Wordless, he takes the chip from her hand.\n \u201cWhen?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhen did he pass?\u201d\n \u201cWhat passed was his body,\u201d Alternate Girl says. \u201cYou hold him in your hands.\u201d\n Even if she doesn\u2019t say the words, he can hear them.\n He remembers Mechanic telling him that they are alike and he knows this is a gift he cannot deny.\n \u201cWill I still be myself?\u201d He asks.\n \u201cYou will always be yourself,\u201d Alternate Girl replies.\n He hands her the chip and bends toward her.\n \u201cThen,\u201d he says. \u201clet this body also house his memory.\u201d\n The world around him changes. He changes too. Mechanic is a memory. Mechanic is a dream. Mechanic lives on inside him.\n He has no regrets.\n Rochita Loenen-Ruiz is an essayist, fictionist and a poet.

The vibrations filled the heads of everyone within a twenty-five kilometer radius with harmonics. The world became a giant MRI chamber at twenty hours GMT. They should know. Every single one of them had to go through MRI clearance before they were allowed into the interdimensional tunnel-throughs that had brought them. Here. They did not even know what twenty hours GMT signified on Sesen. Was it really nighttime? How could they tell if the sun was the sun and the moons were moons, when night and day were not dissimilar? The stars came out in the morning. The moons filled the skies with varicolored radiance at night. Those were the most obvious indicators.\nEshe navigated the honeycombed network of caves, her hands tucked deep within her cloudy-gray parka. The swiftly dropping temperature was one way of knowing that it was nighttime. Eshe wished she had not forgotten her mittens, but the call of the mammoth crystal was far too strong, the pull far too compelling. Ignoring was not an option\u2014her limbs seemed to move before her mind did. The other apiarists avoided the almost cylindrical hollow that was Grand-Daddy\u2019s Cavern but the music drew her in every time.\nThe music filled her with a desire to engage with the throbbing mass of colors, and light. Often it felt like Grand-Daddy was more than just a crystal, as though it was the heart of the entire planet. It thrummed like a breathing organism.\nShe met Lashav the first time Grand-Daddy had called to her.\nThe Barlishya\u2019s lightly furred arms were raised to the radiating crystal almost as though she was basking in his glow. Lashav had transformed into a cheetah in her panicked surprise, her fangs bared, her tight-muscled form crouched to attack before she changed her mind, jumping up on her favorite ledge to curl up.\nFrightened, Eshe had left the cavern. The next night, Grand-Daddy had called to her again with a thrumming that Eshe could not ignore even if she wanted. Lashav was there in clothed humanoid form.\n\u201cI am sorry, I cannot always control the change,\u201d Lashav said.\nHer tone was meek but her eyes were bold, and assessing Eshe in a way that made her feel like bees were crawling beneath her skin. She exhaled, and inhaled. It was difficult to remember these days to do something so basic. As air traveled back into her body, Eshe began to feel uncomfortable with Lashav\u2019s regard. She fidgeted in discomfort. \u201cNo, no, it is not your fault. I am still new here, and you are new to me,\u201d Eshe said as she involuntarily took a step back, willing herself not to look away from the Barlishya woman.\n\u201cYou are a hatchling,\u201d Lashav said. It was a statement, not a question.\n\u201cNo, not quite. I lived a full life on Earth, before . . . \u201d\n\u201cBefore what your people call dark matter pulled you apart and then put you together again?\u201d\nLashav was as sharp as a finely whetted knife. Her eyes bore into Eshe with the perception of multitudes. How much of the over-soul was in this Barlishya woman? Eshe shivered a little against the hungry, yet oddly judgmental intensity of Lashav\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cYes, that is what the physicists on the relocation team say. But the rest of us are not as clear on the details,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDark matter pulled you apart and put you together again, the same way it did us. Aided by your bunian who are entities forged from dark matter as well.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d This information was new to Eshe. \u201cThey come from dark matter? How is that possible?\u201d\n\u201cYou find that impossible. And yet,\u201d Lashav said, pausing significantly before she continued, \u201cand yet you traveled through dimensions to reach this world, did you not? A world where this . . . dark matter is stronger in concentration than in the world you have left behind.\u201d\n\u201cDid the bunian come from this world then?\u201d Eshe asked.\nLashav shook her head with mild distaste, her silvery mane framing a pert, nut-brown face. \u201cNot from this world, nor from this dimension, or they would not have been able to splinter the over-soul in that way.\u201d\nLashav made it sound like a physical pain. Eshe involuntarily took her hand and then just as impulsively dropped it. The Barlishya\u2019s eyes went very wide.\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Eshe said. \u201cI only meant to comfort you, I shouldn\u2019t have touched you.\u201d\n\u201cComfort, what is this thing?\u201d Lashav asked. Her brow was furrowed in concentration as she absorbed the new concept with far more difficulty than the ease with which she had been talking about dark matter.\n\u201cTo soothe you, make you feel better. We achieve this through the touching of skin, and of . . . fur, I suppose. The heat, pressure, and friction is meant to comfort our consciousness.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean to couple and to mate?\u201d Lashav gave Eshe a speculative look.\n\u201cNo.\u201d To Eshe\u2019s utter surprise, she found herself blushing. \u201cThere is more than one way to touch, and to make another person feel better. It does not always include coupling or mating.\u201d\nLashav considered this. \u201cI suppose this is true. I think our matings are not the same as yours, anyway. We are hatched, when we were not splintered. All is new to us, because so much of what we were is lost.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that so?\u201d Eshe asked. Humanity had committed some sort of destruction here too, Eshe surmised. She despaired. In escaping the destruction of their own planet, had they wreaked some kind of unforgivable schism here as well?\n\u201cWhen the bunian emissaries entered the over-soul, they dissolved into dark matter. They splintered the soul, and seeded the soul with schematics of what was desired in this world.\u201d\nHer knees did not feel able to support her body, and so Eshe sank to the sandy ground of the cavern. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Eshe said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. We are monsters. We let them do this to you.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lashav sat down beside Eshe and put her hand over Eshe\u2019s.\n\u201cYou did not do this thing to us. You have no blame. Let me, what is that word you Arrivals use . . . let me comfort you.\u201d\nLashav sat beside Eshe and held her hands.\n\u201cTell me what to do to make it right. To make it hurt less,\u201d Eshe whispered to Lashav, her lashes glimmering with droplets of nearly-shed tears.\n\u201cGrand-Daddy will tell you. That is why he called you here,\u201d Lashav said, her eyes fixed on the thrumming crystal. Violet and cerulean blue lights shimmered at the penumbra of the incandescent white heart of the living crystal. They both stared, the one in a trance, the other, in a near-hypnotized wonder while they clasped each other\u2019s hands.\nEshe visited Grand-Daddy every night after that second night, and Lashav would be waiting for her. They learned the language of comfort long before they learned the myriad ways of exploring each other. Through flesh, through skin. Through touch, through taste.\nEshe\u2019s final decade on Earth had felt like sleepwalking.\nDislocation dogged her every waking moment, padding behind her like a faithful pet. It hummed in her veins through hours spent in the lab, through various seminars and briefings as they prepared to leave a world that was about to die. Nothing seemed to contain meaning when one was certain of the annihilation of one\u2019s home. Eshe barely tasted the food she ate, and could barely allow herself to care for the lovers she took on and discarded like last night\u2019s leftovers.\nEshe sometimes remembered her condominium in Serdang that was full of different tapestries and figurines representing Neith, the Egyptian goddess of war and weaving. It had been a teenage fascination that grew into a kind of personal obsession, a digital exploration of a part of Egypt that was not wholly her heritage. Her ancestors had been Egyptian Christian. Her mother Elpis however, walked her own path through faith and science. As did Eshe.\nEshe\u2019s condominium had sprawled on the twenty-first floor, a generous gift from Elpis when her daughter had turned twenty-one. It overlooked a golf course and a lavish country club patronized by entrepreneurs, lower cabinet ministers of the Malaysian government and MLM scamlords moonlighting as venture capitalists. The apartment would have been seen as an indulgence by many\u2014Elpis said she wanted to be sure her children all had the gift of a better life than the one she had led. She did not provide much information about her flight from Egypt.\nNeither Eshe nor her siblings felt they had the right to ask.\nWhenever Eshe tried to recollect the exact size and depth of her apartment, her memories juxtaposed with documentaries about Neith, and Isis, and Horus, and Sobek she had watched, along with numerous online databases she had trawled. It was as though all of the information she had imbibed had scrambled her memories.\nEshe had never known a world in which she didn\u2019t have to relocate because it was going to be destroyed. It was therefore hard to feel extreme nostalgia for something she always knew she was going to lose. And if she did now sometimes miss the taste of kushari, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure if she was remembering correctly the texture of rice, pasta, and lentils tossed in tomato sauce that was such a mainstay of her childhood. Taste, smell, and touch remained her constant, her anchor for all of her memories. Vision and sound could be deceiving, but there was at least some kind of verisimilitude of the act of consumption, of the way taste and sensation rolled about in one\u2019s mouth.\nShe had a childhood soaked in the borrowed nostalgia of her parents, and of her grandparents. She inherited the demons and ghosts that nipped at the heels of both Elpis and her Hakka father, John. Her mother\u2019s struggles with visa and permanent resident status in Malaysia, her father\u2019s own inherited anger over racial inequity and May 13th, that day of mass terror that marked forever the moment in which the trajectory of Malaysia\u2019s destiny would depart from its original course. Memory had never been an uncomplicated thing. You\u2019d think a child born from two fragmented diasporas would be used to this. But this was different. This dissonance contained a different flavor entirely.\nAt night, Eshe would walk to the apiary to continue her scheduled observations of the bees of Sesen, uncompromisingly alien with their alternating stripes of indigo, black, and cobalt blue. The hum of the bees often seemed to resonate at the same frequency as Grand-Daddy\u2019s thrumming. After she had started drinking untreated honey, there were days when she swore it was the same thing.\n\u201cHumanity nearly wiped out the bees on Earth at one point,\u201d Shakuntala had once said to her as Eshe followed her on their rounds.\n\u201cYes, but that was before my time,\u201d Eshe watched white-winged cranes fly towards the forest that receded towards the Southern Mountain Range, presumably to roost before moonshine crept over the top of the trees. \u201cMy mother wrote extensive notes about it, about how she\u2019d tried to create different protective environments for the bees she cultivated in Cameron Highlands.\u201d\n\u201cElpis was a great apiarist,\u201d Shakuntala\u2019s face wore the soft cast of remembrance, her voice subdued as she said, \u201cI enjoyed working with her a lot. But, you\u2019re here now, and we can utilize some of your mother\u2019s experiments in figuring out the best homes for these bees.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have pesticides on Sesen so that should simplify some aspects of our research,\u201d Eshe commented.\nShakuntala said, \u201cThat is right, and the society of astrobiologists have already ensured that most forms of pesticides will be banned. We\u2019ve already seen their ill-effect on the planet we\u2019ve had to abandon.\u201d\n\u201cHas the society of agriculture agreed to this?\u201d Eshe was skeptical, but she was still newly come from Earth, and Shakuntala had spent nearly fifteen years on Sesen.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how deeply we fucked up the home we left,\u201d Shakuntala met Eshe\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cYou did not see how bad it was towards the end,\u201d Eshe\u2019s eyes blinked rapidly as she remembered the looting, the indiscriminate slaughter, and the full-on religious panic during the final days, before they escaped via the tunnel-throughs. No more liquid, only blinking. Some nights it felt as though all of the liquid had drained out.\n\u201cHere, help me with this wall,\u201d Shakuntala beckoned at her, forestalling further reminiscences of a planet that no longer existed. Eshe stepped towards to the other side of the hexagon-shaped fibrous panel that Shakuntala was using to build the walls.\nThe more senior astrobiologists had wasted no time in constructing artificial hives so they could study the habits of the bees of Sesen when they arrived on Sesen. These hives were lightweight. With some cheekiness they had agreed to construct them in the shape of the Calabi-Yau manifolds as a homage to the work of the string theorists who had helped with the development of the tunnel-throughs.\n\u201cAre the Calabi-Yau shapes effective, or are they just something we\u2019ve been using because it amuses us?\u201d Eshe asked.\nShakuntala grunted as she hammered joints together. \u201cBoth, really. The Sesen bees seem to like these interlinked hives, and the honey they produce tastes better than the more generic hives.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d like to experiment with that, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d Eshe said as she reached for a hammer of her own from the toolbox set on a stool beside Shakuntala.\nShakuntala took some time fixing the joints of one of the walls before she asked, \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d\n\u201cExperiment with flavor. The honeys we had on Earth were so rich, so heady . . . \u201d\n\u201cAs are the honey produced by these bees,\u201d Shakuntala interrupted.\n\u201cYes, yes. But there\u2019s not enough variety, depth, texture,\u201d Eshe waved her hands in the air, including the one that clutched at the hammer.\nShakuntala gently touched her hands, stilling her near-dangerous movements. \u201cI think what you mean to say is that the honey here does not taste like home.\u201d\n\u201cNothing tastes, feels, or looks like home,\u201d Eshe said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point, Eshe. We can never go back. That home is gone. Now. We can sit here grieving. Or we can finish building this wall. And then the next one. Until we\u2019ve got ourselves the biggest complex of hives in Calabi-Yau shapes in this apiary.\u201d\nEshe nodded, her eyes still blinking. She rubbed them with the back of her hand, the itch was growing to be troublesome. She reminded herself to ask the medical unit for some eye drops.\n\u201cI cried for ten months after my arrival. We were the pioneer batch, it was terrifying. We had no basis for comparison. None. And we knew what we had left behind would never be waiting for our return,\u201d Shakuntala gently squeezed Eshe\u2019s shoulders.\nIt was dusk when they finished constructing the hive that would be joined to the others.\n\u201cCome on, I\u2019ll walk you to the mess,\u201d Shakuntala said. They padlocked the door that opened into the hive. Tomorrow they would release a batch of bees into it.\nEshe zipped up her parka as she shivered in the cold Sesen wind. Above them, birds that were both similar and yet fundamentally dissimilar from the birds she had known on Earth flew, released like the breath that fluttered in her chest when she exhaled. Grief was the periodic reminder that you were holding your breath in for too long, a breath that needed to be released so you could live, even if you did not understand why living was necessary, why any of this was necessary, Eshe mused.\n\u201cThere were no birds like these when we first arrived,\u201d Shakuntala said as she pulled on her mittens. Eshe pulled on her own as she watched.\n\u201cHow did they manage to bioengineer so quickly, even with what they did to the over-soul?\u201d Eshe asked. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s only so much dark matter can do on its own, right? The building blocks of creation, how far can that process go, how does it get accelerated? It doesn\u2019t make much sense to me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mystery to me as well,\u201d Shakuntala said, \u201calthough the manner of multiplication and mutation of genes may be said to be almost . . . magical. Almost Vedic, as a matter of fact. But apart from that, what do we know? Our machines made on Earth have all but stopped functioning, and we\u2019ve been learning which of our technologies can be used, and which need to be changed.\u201d\nThey entered the long, dimly-lit mess hall where food was served buffet-style much in the same way they\u2019d been served in university cafeterias back in Malaysia. Eshe closed her eyes as she always did to take in the aromas, feeling the pulling sensation of memories she did not know she could fully claim as her own.\nShakuntala turned to Eshe. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you have materials to build different kinds of hives. See what you can do with your experimentations with honey.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, I really appreciate it,\u201d Eshe said.\nShakuntala dished aloo gobi onto her aluminum plate, saying, \u201cWe all need something to divert ourselves from what\u2019s been done to us, and to this world. We\u2019re\u2014well, most of us at least\u2014trying in our own way to atone.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u201cThat you seek atonement for what the Bunian Empire did to the planet? Perhaps I know because I feel much the same way, Eshe.\u201d\nAh. Eshe met Shakuntala\u2019s eyes in acknowledgement. There was nothing she could say that felt adequate. A smile would be disrespectful. \u201cThank you, Shakuntala.\u201d\n\u201cThis is another way in which I choose to atone,\u201d Shakuntala said.\nEshe took a scoop of dhall, and another scoop of kushari onto her own plate, adding a small container of salad, and two pieces of eesh baladi bread. There were Egyptian cooks in the mess, some of whom had actually worked in Malaysia. It was a comfort, but there was always the sense that what they were eating was as real as they were.\nWhich was to say, they were a negligible reality.\nGyasi had said more than once that simulacrums experienced phenomena in a wholly different way. Eshe would reply very sensibly that they were experiencing phenomena differently because everything about Sesen was different and yet painfully similar to Earth. The over-soul had shaped itself into something livable for its new inhabitants, creating a symbiotic relationship between human and planet.\nThe truth was that she was haunted. She knew she was not the same person who had grown up in Serdang in Malaysia to agnostic parents. The method through which they had Arrived on Sesen had ensured that they were not the same.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a different composition altogether,\u201d Gyasi would say, his eyes red-rimmed and wild, \u201cdifferent compounds of consciousness and matter.\u201d\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Eshe would counter obstinately. Memory was to Eshe the bedrock of her being. If memory existed, so did Eshe. However, for Gyasi, their memories were as false as their senses.\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not Eshe and I\u2019m not Gyasi, did you ever think of that?\u201d Gyasi said to her one afternoon in the cavern that served as their laboratory on Sesen. \u201cPerhaps we have been reconstituted from more than one person in the same space, and these memories we have of Earth are composite memories.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re astrobiologists and apiarists, not neuroscientists nor philosophers, Gyasi,\u201d Eshe said.\n\u201cBiology is the science of organic things. We apprehend organic things through our senses. It remains a mystery if the senses we have now correspond to the senses we had back on Earth. You\u2019ve mentioned the aftertaste of violets more than once in relation to the honey provided by the hives, Eshe. But how do we even know what violets taste like?\u201d\nGyasi looked genuinely distressed by this thought, even as he uttered it. Eshe could think of nothing to say to comfort him, so she placed a hand on his wrist and gave it a comforting squeeze. The younger apiarist fell silent, and then the friction of skin upon skin evoked other memories that Gyasi would swear were not real.\nAt night, Gyasi would write tortured poetry that would win him the regard of the younger apiarists. He flung himself into a series of affairs, both men and women. For a very long time, he dated Anthony Lim, one of the Administrators. That had been an uneasy partnership that dissolved after Anthony grew tired of equal servings of pragmatic philosophy and untrammeled ontological angst. Eshe had comforted Gyasi when the breakup occurred, as he did her, when she broke up with three women within three weeks, in spectacularly tempestuous displays of dissatisfaction.\nShe started drinking the untreated honey.\nThe honey slowly changed the way Eshe viewed the world. It transformed her perception of the color of the multihued sky. She no longer saw lines and various material forms as solid. Everything was changing, and when she looked at things she saw gradations of color, and the shifting of lines and curves.\nHer irises enlarged preternaturally. That change brought a difference in the perception of color. Her skin changed and had a deepened sensitivity to every tactile impression of the new world. Nothing felt the same, not fur, not skin, not the taste of violets on the tongue. If qualia was externalized perception, then the physiological changes that came with drinking untreated honey had changed not just her biology but her ontology. Everything that was in flux before became solid, and so immediate that it frightened her. It was as though there was no filter between her private thoughts and externalized experience. Perhaps, she had lost the intrinsic nature of the woman she had been before. Grief had fluttered away with the other birds she released when she exhaled.\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to ask me, Gyasi. You ask me the same question with every flavor we put out. How do we know if rain forest honey really tastes like this?\u201d Eshe mimicked Gyasi\u2019s voice right down to the morose lowered tone on the last two syllables.\nGyasi smoothed his hair back before pulling the mass of ringlets upwards into a messy topknot that he secured with a pencil, his bead bracelets and silver bangles jangling against lightly furred upper arms of dark brown.\n\u201cIt is a legitimate question, Eshe. We\u2019re walking, living, and breathing Putnam\u2019s thought experiments. You know that the way we are perceiving things is different. Everything feels and tastes and looks and sounds different. Fuck.\u201d He cursed as he made a mistake in the ledger. Gyasi struck out the line and started again on the next line. He said, \u201cFuck it, Eshe. Even you look different. You keep drinking the untreated honey, and you\u2019re starting to look as freaky as that alien lover of yours who looks like a furry cosplayer\u2019s erotic dream come to life. Your eyes are starting to look like insect eyes. Beautiful, but also scary. You\u2019re no longer Eshe. You\u2019re a simulacrum on a twin world. We\u2019re living and breathing Putnam\u2019s hypothesis.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite, Gyasi, or we would have twins back on Earth. Earth is no more, and Sesen was modified by the over-soul to accommodate us. As best it could. Also, stop checking out my girlfriend, you lecherous bastard.\u201d\nGyasi ignored this, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re ghosts then, badly composited twins of the selves we left behind. And we still don\u2019t know why the over-soul was so accommodating. We\u2019re Arrivals. We want to believe we\u2019re migrants, but look at us changing things. We\u2019re colonizers, Eshe. Why would the over-soul want to change things for us? We\u2019re messing with the biorhythm of the bees using those crystals. It feels unethical.\u201d\nEshe poured the honey into the last jar. She capped and then sealed the jar, placing it on the shelf with the rest of type XXVII. They would keep five specimens of the honey for future reproduction, but the rest would be distributed amongst the human colonies on the main continent, with some kept to be artificially replicated for the outlying colonies. Even here, the elite got the best of everything. But they had already known they were not leaving a planet about to be destroyed to go to a better world, not when the Administrators were handpicked from dominant oligarchies.\nThey had been working together for so many years before they had arrived on Sesen that they became each other\u2019s yardsticks for how much they had changed. From the outside, it felt as though Gyasi had not changed at all, but for the perpetual hollow expression in his eyes and the downward turn of his mouth. Even towards the end of their days on Earth, Gyasi had been jocular. Here, his jokes felt as staged as his bravado.\nHis eyes were as haunted as the eyes of her Barlishya lover.\n\u201cGyasi. Can\u2019t we just enjoy the fact that we\u2019ve produced this gorgeous honey without descending into ontological angst? Just once? The crystals thrum regardless of what we do, and the world is in flux. Everything is changing, everything is malleable. What we\u2019re doing is just helping the planetary over-soul. This is a new world. We are new too. Can\u2019t you just relax for one evening?\u201d\nGyasi unbuttoned his lab coat and placed it on one of the swivel chairs.\n\u201cFor you, I can try, Eshe. But as for enjoying myself, I fully intend on doing so,\u201d He planted a kiss on her forehead and then headed for the door.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cI have a date,\u201d His grin was a desperate attempt at nonchalance, not at all aided by the unrelenting haunted aspect of his eyes, \u201cafter all, enjoying ourselves is important, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nEshe decided to ignore the bait.\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing too close again. Do you want Grand-Daddy to consume you?\u201d\nLashav asked. The Barlishya had been resting her head on her knees, bearing the familiar signs of post-shape-shifting fatigue.\n\u201cWhat harm could it do? I\u2019ve been here so many times in the past month.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re neither Arlishya, nor Barlishya. Grand-Daddy still has problems understanding your kind. It still does not understand me and my kin even though we\u2019re all of the over-soul. Grand-Daddy cannot comprehend a world in which everything is splintered and not connected to the over-soul.\u201d\n\u201cWhile I cannot comprehend a world in which everything is merely one thing,\u201d Eshe\u2019s smile was flinty.\n\u201cPerhaps one day you will,\u201d Lashav said as she gracefully slid down from her ledge, her long legs finding easy purchase on the cavern floor.\nThe lovers learned the configurations of their own skin by discovering the pigments and crevices of each other. Eshe knew Lashav when she was a woman, and sometimes knew her when she molded and shifted into humanoid representations of other beasts.\nSometimes, these shape-shiftings would occur when she told Lashav about the Gods and Goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt. When she talked about Anubis, or of Sobek, Lashav would transform into a jackal or a crocodile in wonder, as though wanting to be the stories she was enjoying. When Eshe talked about Neith who was both the warrior and the weaver, Lashav would want to know more about weaving. It did not take long before Eshe had to construct the first weaving-shuttle and loom on Sesen, just so Lashav could understand how weaving worked.\nThe knowing could not always happen, not when quills started growing from Lashav\u2019s back. On many nights, she would be awakened by the soft snuffling of a fully manifested cat, or a wolf or a fox or a raccoon, leaping onto her bunk to sleep at her feet. By morning, she would be spooned within the long, golden-brown limbs and torso of a Barlishya with large eyes of liquid black and beautifully spiraled ears.\nEshe had explored the contours of those ears with a curious tongue, trying to identify the flavor of an alien skin. That alien skin felt like it had the consistency of honey made liquid. When she kissed Lashav and imbibed her nectar, she experienced once again the aftertaste of violets. Violets on the tongue in everything that she tasted.\nShe often wondered about the over-soul, and if she was making love with the entire planet when their limbs were entangled. It came and went when she was with Lashav, a wondering that had no basis in her daily experiences but which teased the back of her mind.\nLashav came closer to her, pulling her by the hand as she voiced this thought.\n\u201cYou Arrivals have such strange ideas about what our world should be. About what you should be,\u201d Lashav said as she hooked her arm around Eshe\u2019s waist, her palm sliding up and down the small of the apiarist\u2019s back.\nEshe shivered as she said, \u201cIt is how we make the unfamiliar familiar. We need that. We don\u2019t even know who we are anymore. We need to know.\u201d\n\u201cI can understand that. I don\u2019t know this world anymore, I don\u2019t know if I ever did,\u201d Lashav said.\nThe desperation in her voice alerted Eshe to what was about to happen. Eshe\u2019s pulse quickened as Lashav drew her down to the sandy floor. It was too close to the thrumming. She shivered as Lashav nuzzled first into her collarbone and then moving on to the curve of her shoulder, swiftly bared by inquisitive fingers.\n\u201cHere, Lashav? Right next to Grand-Daddy? I thought you said not to go too close.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as close as you were before. This is reasonably safe. Besides, he won\u2019t care, and none of your kind visit this cave. They\u2019re too afraid. Of me. Of us. Of this world. You\u2019re the only one. The only one. Honey.\u201d\nHoney. The word that was an endearment on the planet that she had left. The word that was her lived reality in Serdang. The word that she had taught her lover.\nThat moment remained in their memories, even when the promise of \u201cthe only one\u201d was proved to have the veracity of a moment of intense corporeal communion. The truth became a lie the night Gyasi heard Grand-Daddy\u2019s thrumming, and his feet brought him to the cavern.\nThey had enjoyed nearly half an Earthly century together, but Grand-Daddy\u2019s thrumming had grown hungrier recently. Insistent as the imperative towards aging, even if aging came slow, very slowly for the human Arrivals who found their physiology altered by their journey. This thrumming felt like the music of the over-soul, the song of constellations, and of galaxies exploding. The sound tasted like the dark matter that had helped the physicists find a way to tunnel through to this world. The thrumming was like the wings of a million hummingbirds. It had the aftertaste of the purest, most distilled honey that could be produced by the hives of Sesen bees, magnified by about a thousand. It was as though the thrumming was melting her limbs from the inside. She had no idea that sound could have a taste, a taste that was so familiar, like the first time her mother had spread honey on flatbread for her.\nA shifting in Lashav\u2019s position woke Eshe. Lashav was curled into herself in a defensive gesture that made Eshe thoughtful. Gyasi had been spooning Eshe earlier, but he was now spread-eagle on the woven blankets they had brought with them, along with candles that had been lit as they meditated together in the cavern as Grand-Daddy dominated their conscious thought.\nWhat if we had been reconstituted? Gyasi had asked her, all of those years ago, when they were both young, and terrified without being aware of how frightened they were. Even Eshe, despite what the untreated honey had done to her.\nWhat if we had been remade, and we are not what we once were?\nWhat if. What if moving through dark matter meant that they were no longer the people they were on Earth? What if they were all simulacrums?\nOr ghosts?\nEshe turned back suddenly. She moved towards Lashav who was whimpering in her sleep. She bent down from the waist to give her lover a kiss on the shoulder. She brushed the palm of her hand tenderly over Gyasi\u2019s smooth bald pate, watching him as he slept, his features made cherubic by age. It was an unconsciously maternal gesture.\nWas she doing this?\nShe thought she had escaped the ontological undoing, the unmaking caused by the trauma of Arrival. But this felt altogether different. This was a yearning. A yearning that vibrated through her bones, filling her as she imbibed of the alien nectar, and entangled herself with limbs nightly that were more of that thick, sweet liquid made flesh.\nShe was drinking the over-soul.\nCorrection. They were all drinking the over-soul.\nEshe moved back towards Grand-Daddy. She braced her palms against the smooth, crystalline quartz surface. It was hot. It felt like Grand-Daddy was melting her brains, her bones, and her consciousness.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Eshe?\u201d\nGyasi\u2019s sleep-blurred voice startled her.\n\u201cI cannot resist Grand-Daddy\u2019s song anymore, Gyasi.\u201d\n\u201cI know, none of us can. We\u2019ve stopped each other from doing this over the years. But it\u2019s going to happen now, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why we\u2019re here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWe? I wasn\u2019t going to involve either of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go without us, Eshe,\u201d Lashav said, getting up, \u201cwe all needed to be ready at the same time for this.\u201d\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve always known what Grand-Daddy\u2019s song was about, and why it sounded so strongly in our heads in particular. We knew why it wanted us. We agreed to come here tonight because we knew. We knew you were going to do it.\u201d Gyasi said, his voice soft and gentle.\nEshe looked at her partners. She knew she could not deny them what she wanted for herself. She nodded, and opened her arms. Lashav came first, the raccoon ears that always protruded from her hair in times of fear quivering, her raccoon tail elongating to twine around her lovers. Eshe could barely register the hands pulling at her waist, and the arms and tail embracing her. Her eyes were fixed on the incandescence at the heart of Grand-Daddy, her tongue consumed by the taste of violets. They were overcome by a crystalline ecstasy, a fierce joy they never knew they had been striving for with each melting union of flesh and fluid.\nEshe/Lashav/Gyasi melted into the embrace of the over-soul.\nThey woke up into a consciousness that embraced galaxies, and cradled a planet of living crystals. They fed it fractured memories of world myths. Memories that Gyasi had deemed false. He was now resigned to the verisimilitude of what they had brought across.\nTheir bodies shifted, splitting. Gyasi felt his maw elongating and changing as the over-soul fed on the stories of its lovers shaped him into the Crocodile.\nEshe was transmuted into The Woman Who Weaves, master of The Grand Complect that was to guide and shape the civilizations of Sesen in the centuries to come, effectively disrupting the planned trajectory of human civilization on Sesen that the Administrators had so carefully laid out.\nGrand-Daddy thrummed as it made a mythology for the still-new world out of the fragmented memories of the planet it had consumed. It was a mythology that would wipe out the oligarchies of the old world, and the cultural memories of those who had Arrived.\nThe over-soul felt she had every cause to feel pleased with herself.\nFuture statues and temple friezes depicting the over-soul as the Cat or as the Racoon-Daughter of the Seven Sentient Moons would wear the same smug smile she wore when she joined with her spouses in the embrace back into the core of her splintered being.\nPerhaps Eshe and Gyasi had been transformed before they had ever entered Sesen. Perhaps they were never the humans they had been on Earth. But there was one thing Lashav, or the Cat knew, because it was the one thing she had wanted so badly she remade the planet\u2019s core consciousness for them. She remade herself for this new reality.\nHere at least, they would never die.\nNin Harris is an author, poet, critical theorist and Gothic scholar who exists in a perpetual state of unheimlich.

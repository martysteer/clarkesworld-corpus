The taste blooms sharp and familiar, tangy and sweet. \u201cI picked these two days ago. They\u2019re fresher than practically anyone can get.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s arguing; she wants Leona to come berry-picking with her, wants the forest to wrap its arms around her sister and tell her to stay.\nLeona leans over the counter, setting her chin on long arms. \u201cDid I tell you about the one time I managed to get veeberries?\u201d She doesn\u2019t wait for Norami to shake her head; they both know she hasn\u2019t. \u201cI was on leave from Xunan at the time\u2014a whole month off that fucking ice planet\u2014and I went to Descan Station with a couple friends. We\u2019d all been eating prepackaged food while we searched for plants with any nutritional value whatsoever, and all I could think about were veeberries.\u201d\nLeona looks off to the side, eyes soft. \u201cI dragged my friends all around the station looking for them and found them in a specialty tea shop, of all places. They had them freeze-dried, I guess to add them to tea as a kind of ridiculous expensive garnish. They cost thirty-five hundred kenels\u2014can you believe that? Thirty-five hundred kenels for five hundred grams of dry berry mush. The texture of them wasn\u2019t right, obviously. They just sort of melted away, but the taste . . . I don\u2019t know, it brought me back a bit.\u201d Leona rolls her eyes. \u201cCried the whole time I ate them, of course. Ridiculous.\u201d\nNorami rolls another berry around on her tongue and smiles at her sister. \u201cOf course we can pick fresh.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know how long Leona will stay\u2014she seems destined for some city apartment or sparkling space station\u2014but she wants to show her sister all the good things about this place, about home, while she\u2019s here.\n\u201cI have an extra suit,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I just patched up a rip in one of the legs, so you\u2019ll have to be careful.\u201d\nLeona snorts. \u201cWe\u2019re picking veeberries, Mi, of course we have to be careful.\u201d\nAnd so it goes.\nNorami puts her jacket on over her overalls, thick plastic-lined canvas, and reaches for a scarf. For the first time in over a decade, her sister does the same thing next to her. Norami watches her for a moment, the tallness of her, the youth, the shock of her light hair. She wants to tell Leona to put it up or into braids, always the older sister, but she knows better than that.\nNorami tries to hold the moment in her mind, tells herself not to hope for an easy future here, where her sister shrugs into jackets and conversations like it\u2019s nothing, like it\u2019s all muscle memory and open doors.\nShe tells herself not to worry, too, but in the forest a little worry is a good thing.\nNorami\u2019s back door opens almost directly into the forest, just a dozen meters between the steps and the first trees. The trees are tall, and the forest is dense and sparse by turns\u2014still and quiet and almost uniformly dark. Norami once spent a quarter of a year trying to find and name all its colors that weren\u2019t green and found mostly purples and blues, shadows on shadows. She wonders sometimes that the suns\u2019 light ever reaches the forest floor.\nAs they reach the forest\u2019s rambling edge, Norami can\u2019t resist the impulse to reach for her sister\u2019s hand. Gloved fingers gripping gloved fingers, she says it lightly, almost like a joke.\n\u201cYou remember the protocols, right?\u201d\nLeona faces away from her, but Norami can sense her eyes rolling regardless. \u201cYes, I remember. V is for venom. No punctures, no marks, keep the antivenom close.\u201d She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the blue injection pen.\nNorami pats her own pocket and feels a matching pen. She doesn\u2019t tell Leona how much it hurts, even as the antivenom kicks in. The pain is searing bright, totally consuming, and the hallucinations that come with it so convincing that Norami still isn\u2019t sure of some of her memories, nearly two decades later.\nWhen Norami stared down the Young Explorers application essay prompt\u2014describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it\u2014a year after the veeberry sting, she couldn\u2019t write about anything else. It was rolling admissions, open to anyone twelve to fifteen, and Leona had already gotten in, the first time she was doing something Norami hadn\u2019t done first. Norami was balancing the lingering aches and weakness from the veeberry toxins with sisterly confusion at the shift. Leona was going out and away, to the stars, to planets unseen, and Norami echoed with anticipatory loneliness and thought maybe she wanted to go too.\nThe veeberry sting gave her context when the rejection came, just as Leona was packing to go to training\u2014rejection hurt, but there was no pain like a veeberry sting.\nHer application is the only thing she ever really kept from Leona. Norami\u2019s happy here, now, but she couldn\u2019t face it at the time, her rejection slinking after her sister\u2019s success.\nAlven is an old planet, settled early and quickly forgotten for newer ones with more to offer, but its depths hide all the extremes explorers abandoned it for. It\u2019s a Level Nine planet, full oxygen after three generations, and its forests are the only place veeberries and melor mushrooms grow. Its fields grow round gantry fruits low to the ground, and the forests took well to apple seeds. Its generous atmosphere and the lack of known animals other than insects made it an easy bio-planet\u2014low industry, high sustainability; low population, high yield.\nIn the town where Norami and Leona grew up, people mostly work at the processing factory, preparing food for long journeys to more populous planets or the school. Quite a few are foragers like Norami, but in the way it always is, they\u2019re mostly older. The arrows of Alven all point up and away. Not everyone goes out like Leona\u2014that is to say, triumphant, the whole town talking about their success\u2014but a lot of them leave one way or another. It\u2019s so easy. They just have to follow the food, follow the recruiters, follow all the well-trod trails out.\nAfter Leona shipped off, Norami left town and apprenticed for a forager for a few years. She was an ideal apprentice, eighth generation on Alven, lungs perfectly accustomed, feet spread wide and soft to accommodate the moss. The boots from off-planet don\u2019t really fit her anymore, and her hands have gone long-fingered and tough. She has a mild acquired resistance to veeberry venom and a smooth, silent way of walking between vines. She sees perfectly well in the low light of a forest, relies on the softness of bark and the bright pop of mushrooms and berries. Her trails lead in, not out.\nNorami leads the way, her blue headlamp making gentle shadows between the trees. The tree trunks in this part of the forest, near the edge, are hung with light green vines always reaching for the light. She\u2019s worn a branching trail to the patch over the years, and she follows the path mindlessly even where it\u2019s not visible.\nBehind her, Leona seems to be finding every stone and log on the way.\n\u201cThis gear is heavy,\u201d she says after she rams her toe into a softly rotting branch that hasn\u2019t done anything to her. \u201cThere are much lighter, more durable materials you could use.\u201d\nNorami doesn\u2019t like to talk in the woods, but there\u2019s no point trying to be silent now. \u201cBack-planet foragers aren\u2019t quite as high on the priority list for new materials as planet forces.\u201d Perhaps she should feel bitter about it, but the words come out matter-of-fact. Norami hesitates, weighing her words against her wants. \u201cWe can always go back if you want. The berries will still be there another day.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Leona says. \u201cI\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\nNorami doesn\u2019t know what to do with the little blossom of hope that gives her. She hasn\u2019t asked Leona how long she means to stay, and she finds in the moment that she doesn\u2019t want to know, can\u2019t bear to ask. She kicks a drying piece of moss lightly with the toe of her boot instead. It\u2019s another twenty minutes to the berry patch, and that\u2019s at her pace, not Leona\u2019s.\nShe wants things to be good here for Leona, wants someone with the eyes of an outsider and the heart of a local to judge this place worthy and interesting the way Norami knows it is. The forest seems to curl in around them, soft lower branches curving upward toward them, leaves reaching toward the harsh plastic of their jackets, a caress and maybe also a warning. And Norami wants. To be judged worthy, a path worth following after all.\nBut not yet. She can\u2019t push Leona yet. She has to give the forest a chance to speak for itself. Veeberries are a good first step. There\u2019s nothing like them, not anywhere.\nAt the fork in the trail by the thick old droram tree, Norami turns to Leona to ask her what path she wants to take\u2014through the forest or along the stream\u2014but her sister is still several steps behind her. The soft beams of Norami\u2019s blue light hit Leona\u2019s face, and Norami sees tears on her cheeks, her fingers glistening as they curl around a dangling leaf.\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Norami asks.\nLeona straightens, wipes across her eyes with the back of her hand. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nNorami lets it go and takes her on the path through the forest.\nAs they walk, Norami asks Leona about Kabbel and Xunan. She wants to know what her forest is up against.\nLeona walks behind her, but Norami can hear her straightening up, her voice taking on the authoritative tone of someone who\u2019s traded tales for drinks in plenty of space stations.\nLeona tells her about the caves and canyons on Kabbel, worn through centuries of water and acid, the first time they crossed the great chasm and burrowed through the caves, a team of just four of them. She describes the stark beauty of the planet with breathless phrases that tumble out of her mouth fully formed. Norami can just imagine a listener leaning forward, eyes wide, wanting more. The team got stuck in a series of caves that opened onto a cliff, and Leona had to lead them back out the way they\u2019d come, rationing the food and water and oxygen they had, shivering in light plasticky blankets. She narrates a climb up an icy slope, the literal light at the end of the tunnel, and by the time she\u2019s done telling the story, she\u2019s side by side with Norami, ponytail swinging jauntily, face half-blue in the light.\nNorami is riveted despite herself. \u201cThat sounds horrifying.\u201d Not that there aren\u2019t worse fates in the forest they walk in, but she knows how to avoid those.\nLeona shoots her a sideways grin. \u201cOh, that\u2019s not the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. The worst thing, the most painful, was before I ever left Alven. You know the one, the time I got stung by veeberries.\u201d\nShe says it so casually, so practiced, so sure of herself, that for a moment Norami is frozen in confusion rather than disbelief. Leona continues.\n\u201cYou remember, Mi,\u201d she says. \u201cI was only twelve years old; you were fourteen. We were finally going berry-picking with Dad. We had metal buckets and thick gloves and coats, and I had just started my growth spurt. The berries were amazing picked off the vine, and I wasn\u2019t paying as much attention to the vines as I should have been. My jacket rode up when I reached up to move a branch out of the way, and a vine snuck right into the gap in the side of my overalls and got me right in the stomach.\n\u201cIt hurt so much.\u201d Leona closes her eyes, as if she is remembering. She\u2019s pulled several steps ahead of Norami now.\n\u201cI could have died,\u201d she says. \u201cI probably should have. Dad only barely got the injection pen to me in time, and I still screamed and screamed.\u201d\nAnd then she stops talking, and the silence rises, slow and heavy. Norami barely breathes. Leona is well ahead of her now, leading the way, wandering onto and off of the path Norami made, guided a little by the angle of the light behind her, but now she stops.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe forest seems to lean in around Norami for a moment, and part of her wants to sink back into it, to not say anything, to let Leona carry her story forward. But she shrugs the trailing vines and branches off and steps back onto the path.\n\u201cThe thorn got me on my shoulder,\u201d Norami says, \u201cnot my stomach. The doctors said that\u2019s why I made it\u2014took longer to get to my organs.\u201d\nLeona takes a step toward her, and Norami can see that her eyes are wide, and her face is open. The story she\u2019s just told is real to her, memorized through tellings. Leona would swear that she remembers the feeling of the branch on her hand, the moment the vine slipped beneath the hem of her jacket.\nHow long has she believed this? Is it a story she told her team members on planet surfaces, keeping them awake and alive throughout long, hostile nights? Did she bring it to the cafeteria at the Young Explorers program, her invitation to society there, her memorable hook? When Norami\u2019s thoughts turn to the Young Explorers program, she sees it all at once. Norami\u2019s rejection came with a note telling her not to apply again, something she didn\u2019t think much about at the time, but now . . . There are people out there who think Norami\u2019s a liar and a thief. Leona has been telling herself\u2014and others\u2014this story for a long, long time.\nNorami reaches out to her sister, but stops, hand hovering, as it all catches up to her in a slow, rolling crunch of betrayal. Leona couldn\u2019t even let her have her own pain. That\u2019s what strikes Norami as unfair about it. That she didn\u2019t even have to live through it. That she has all her own stories now, but she still took Norami\u2019s.\n\u201cYou only remember the screaming because that\u2019s all you were there for,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it had happened to you, you would remember the pain.\u201d She swallows. \u201cIt would be the only thing you\u2019d remember.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Leona says, her expression jumbled and changing. \u201cI don\u2019t . . . \u201d\nNorami\u2019s arm is still half outstretched. She curls it back inward and holds her hand against her chest, the weight of it a comfort.\n\u201cDon\u2019t what? Don\u2019t remember the one time you weren\u2019t the center of everything?\u201d Norami flinches as she says it, not because it\u2019s too mean but because it\u2019s too true. It reeks of desperation.\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Norami says, and her voice cracks.\nLeona presses her lips into a flat line for a long, silent moment. Norami reaches out to touch a tree to one side of her, pressing her soft fingers into the rough, flaky bark. These tiny pinpricks of pain against her fingertips she is at least used to.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t the center of things,\u201d Leona says.\nNorami snorts. \u201cAfter you left, everything revolved around the letters and videos you sent from training. Dad would read up on all the articles about the new planets you were going to. Even now, when I go into town, people ask me how you are.\u201d She pauses, searching her sister\u2019s face for something she can\u2019t quite name\u2014guilt, maybe, or understanding.\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember?\u201d she asks.\nLeona tilts her head. Her words are quiet. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She looks around her, seeming to take in the darkness, the straightness of the trunks, and the bluish green of the leaves for the first time. \u201cEvery time I said it, it felt familiar.\u201d She shakes her head, a soft, wondering motion. \u201cI could swear I felt it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not quite an acknowledgment, not quite an apology. It\u2019s a half-extended hand. And Norami is tired of taking the extra step forward.\nShe nods at the path. \u201cJust follow that to the berry patch. I\u2019ve lost my appetite.\u201d After a moment, she takes the light off her head and hands it to Leona. She can make her way well enough without it.\nLeona takes the light without looking at her. \u201cThanks.\u201d\nNorami keeps her grip on the lamp for a second too long, makes Leona tug it away from her. \u201cBe careful,\u201d she says.\nNorami has a short string of postcards, clear pictures taken by Leona with three lines of message on the back of each, of every planet her sister has helped build. Kabbel, and Lenton, and Xunan, and Dahled, and Pormi, bright beads on a short necklace, worlds\u2019 worth.\nTo think that Norami has spent most of her life in the same dozen square kilometers of Alven forest while her sister was exploring the stars. That\u2019s the way everyone in town says it, anyway. Poor Norami, who couldn\u2019t make it out, just burrowed herself deeper in instead.\nThat\u2019s what Norami does after she leaves the path, turning away from Leona and her bright light, just walks farther into her own forest, her own small, unending adventure. The only sounds are the slow ripples of leaves and moss where she steps and the uncouth rustle of her plastic pants and jacket. She walks slowly, wraps her hand around branches, touches the edges of oval leaves with gentle fingers, lets her eyes adjust.\nOften Norami plays games with herself when she walks the silent woods. Sometimes she\u2019s hunting for treasure, sometimes she\u2019s a spy from one of the films they get on old transports, and sometimes she\u2019s herself, a professional forager. But sometimes she\u2019s an astronaut, exploring a new planet\u2019s surface, taking notes on everything she notices, ready to return to her ship or call for her comrades at a moment\u2019s notice.\nShe knows it\u2019s not really like that. Leona has been very clear about that in her messages. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work,\u201d she says, and Norami believes it. But she knows, too, that Leona\u2019s face lights up when she talks about the first year or so on a new planet; building shelters; monitoring oxygen levels; navigating uncertain new terrain; searching for intelligent, communicative life; helping decide what zoning a new planet will get.\nNorami reaches the bank of the small stream and stops to watch the water. She\u2019s not really in a leaping mood. If she goes to the right, she can take a long loop back to the house. If she goes to the left, she\u2019ll reach the veeberry patch and Leona.\nOf course, she could always turn back the way she came.\nLeona is always leaving, too. Learning and loving new places, processing overwhelming amounts of information and passing it on to the next team, the next phase. Going, going, going, giving up everything she\u2019s worked for and starting over again.\nAnd that\u2019s why Norami thinks she may have a chance at keeping Leona after all. Here, with the stream running clear and melodious at her feet, she doesn\u2019t regret the suspiciously worded rejection letter from the Young Explorers program at all. She\u2019s grateful for it, in a roundabout way. Norami has a favorite spot by the bank of this stream, under a weeping westoon tree, where she likes to look through the leaves, dappled purple and red, and listen to the forest. She has fresh fruit whenever she wants it and a cookbook expanding with note cards stuffed between pages. She has new mushroom patches to find, old vines to clear out, trails to break and maintain. Norami has her whole life to know her forest.\nAt the stream, Norami turns left.\n\u201cGood picking?\u201d Norami asks when she sees her sister, a cylinder of blue plastic.\nLeona nods and shows Norami her bucket, already half full, but doesn\u2019t speak. She\u2019s moving quickly and carelessly. Still upset, then. But after another moment she looks back at Norami and smiles a little, so maybe she\u2019s glad Norami came back.\nNorami picks a spot a few meters away and starts picking herself. A few vines twist toward her curiously, but she stills and lets their interest fade. The berries are the size of her thumb, bright orange, fleshy, and very soft. Just looking at them creates an anticipatory pang in Norami\u2019s mouth, the sensation of taste coming before the first yellow-green fruit.\nShe swallows three berries before she tries to speak again. \u201cSo,\u201d she says, \u201cdid you know I applied to the Young Explorers program? I had to wait a year after you applied because I was still in and out of the hospital, recovering.\u201d\nLeona stills, almost drops her bucket. \u201cOh,\u201d she says faintly. \u201cI never thought about recovering.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah, because you made it all up for your essay and forgot all the boring parts.\u201d\nSilence. A few gentle thunks as Norami drops more berries into her bucket.\n\u201cI\u2019m not telling you because I wish I\u2019d gotten in, you know.\u201d Norami reaches down for another clump of berries. \u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019m glad I stayed. I\u2019m telling you because I want us to be honest with each other.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t regret it,\u201d Leona says, pausing with a hand full of berries halfway to her bucket. Her mouth twists. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always great on my end either.\u201d She sighs. \u201cI still wish I hadn\u2019t, though. I mean, I always wanted . . . \u201d She stops, lets the silence hang, stuffs a berry in her mouth.\nNorami turns away, to give her time to come up with whatever she\u2019s thinking through, hoping she\u2019ll get Leona\u2019s honesty in return for her own. She picks another few berries, trailing a gloved finger over a rounded green leaf on her way down to her bucket.\nNorami feels the scream before she hears it. The hairs on her arms and the back of her neck stand straight up, and the shiver rushes through her before the sound does.\n\u201cLeona!\u201d she gasps, but her sister can\u2019t answer because her sister is lying on the edge of the berry patch, screaming. It seems to be the only thing her body can do. Leona\u2019s convulses in great bursts, her body\u2019s only purpose to scream, and breathe, and scream again. The inside of her throat will be ribbons before all this is over.\nNorami scrambles for her injection pen, jams it into her sister\u2019s side, falls to her knees. The bright purple thorn is still stuck in the outside of her sister\u2019s thigh, just where the patched stitching of her overalls leaves a tiny gap. The green-yellow-orange of the berries, almost glowing, and the malevolent purple of the thorns seem to surround them. Norami pulls Leona back, drags her away from the berries, and undoes her overalls. She stares at the thorn, twice the length of a fingernail, curved and vicious.\nLeona has stopped screaming, a bad sign. Her fingers are starting to stiffen.\nQuickly, not decisive so much as choosing not to think, Norami plucks out the thorn and puts her mouth to the wound. She sucks and spits and does not swallow. She\u2019s resistant, not immune. When her spit doesn\u2019t glow slightly purple, she stops. She refastens Leona\u2019s jacket.\nNorami\u2019s body is shivering in recognition, the echoes of pain reverberating through her after decades. In Leona\u2019s open, unseeing eyes, Norami recognizes it. The rushing pain, clarifying and destroying, a tidal wave of hurt. There\u2019s a slight orange smear at the corner of Leona\u2019s mouth.\nNorami drags her sister up so that Leona\u2019s back is against hers and locks her arms around her sister\u2019s shoulders. Leona\u2019s head falls back onto Norami\u2019s left shoulder, and Norami keeps count of the beat of her breaths, each exhale proof that her sister is alive in her slowly stiffening body. If she can reach the house fast enough, the nearest med-pod isn\u2019t far.\nWhen Leona comes to, she will be changed by the pain. Things will seem clearer to her. She will wake in a hospital bed, her blood running purple-tinged red in the clear IV lines, and she will see Norami and smile. Or maybe she will turn away, remembering and ashamed.\nBut even then, she will come around. Her light hair will fan over the dark blue pillow, and she\u2019ll lift her head and tell Norami that she wants to stay, that she\u2019s sorry. She will probably cry, which means Norami will too.\nHer apology will be eloquent but unnecessary, Norami thinks, navigating around a log on the path, careful of her sister\u2019s trailing legs. Norami will smooth her hair and say she\u2019s glad she was there when it happened, that she understands. The pain, yes, but also the theft.\nNorami does understand. She makes herself understand, weaves words into the space her sister left after \u201cI always wanted.\u201d Leona lived life on perpetual adrenaline, and with danger and excitement close to hand at every moment, how else could she make something like home compete with her adventure? How else could she explain why the forest made her cry?\nMaybe Norami is delusional, trying to make herself the winner in a competition her sister moved past years ago. But maybe she\u2019s right.\nIn the hospital room, the morning light on her face, Norami will tell Leona what she was going to say before she says it. That the story started out as a lie and turned into a truth, made Alven just as dangerous and interesting as the surface of every new world she landed on. That the fifteen-year Explorers term grew homesickness like an invasive sickle weed, and the story was her only defense. It was a tether to the tiny world she came from, an arrow curving back against the odds, a well-worn path heading home."}

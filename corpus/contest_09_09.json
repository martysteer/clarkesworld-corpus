These are the uncorrected copies we send off to reviewers, but we thought some of our readers would appreciate a chance to get the early edition. We have three of these available for this competition.\nAll you have to do to be eligible is post a link to this month's issue on your blog, Facebook, or Twitter and then come back here and give us a link to your post/tweet in a comment to this post. Eight times this September, we'll pick a winner at random (my six-year-old is a great random number generator).\nIf you're selected, you get to pick one book from the pile of remaining books. To be fair to others, once you win, you're out of the competition for the rest of the month.\nGood luck!\nWinners: Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form). His anthologies include Upgraded, Galactic Empires, More Human Than Human, Touchable Unreality, The Final Frontier, Not One of Us, The Eagle has Landed, and the Best Science Fiction of the Years series. His latest anthology, The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 6, is now available from Night Shade Books. He currently lives in NJ with his wife and two sons.\n- Dr Paisley - Selected Realms 2\n- Isobel - Selected The Quiet War\n- Sarah - Selected Realms 2\n- Danielle - Selected Realms 2 (all copies gone)\n- TBA\n- TBA\n- TBA\n- TBA\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

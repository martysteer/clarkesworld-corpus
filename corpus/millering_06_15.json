I interview the inhabitants of war zones. I go to Afghanistan, Iraq, the DRC. The stories are all different, but after a while they begin to blur together. The women are tired, and children with thin arms cling to them. We cannot get bread, they say. Or clean water. My husband died last night. My brothers have been taken.\nYou\u2019re a disaster, Annelise says on the phone one night, voice distant and crackling over the satellite phone. I think her tone is fond. It\u2019s difficult to tell, with the static. Come home safe.\nThey took us and raped us one after the other. They are monsters, monsters.\nThey are men, but they are monsters.\nI travel with translators, or embedded into peacekeeping forces. The thump of shells exploding lulls me to sleep.\nOr it starts this way: I am home, and doing the dishes. This is my job when I\u2019m home. Scrape, wash, rinse; my hands are mechanical. Annelise leans on the doorframe. The kitchen is the size of a postage stamp, and the rest of the apartment is not much bigger. We pretend that this is the reason I do not spend much time at home. \u201cDid you see the news?\u201d Her accent curls around each word, turning it into rough music. We met in Durban ten years ago, when I was doing a predictable piece on the townships. Annelise was the only good thing about that trip.\nI set a plate into the drainer. \u201cAbout the meteor?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not sure that\u2019s what it is,\u201d she says. \u201cWeren\u2019t you working there a while ago? The gypsy story?\u201d\n\u201cNot gypsies. Roma. Gypsy\u2019s a pejorative.\u201d I wash off a couple of forks and set them in the drainer. \u201cBut yes. That\u2019s right near where all those people were killed.\u201d\nAll I can remember is how gray the sky was, and how cold it was at night. I have some beautiful pictures from that assignment, but I don\u2019t remember taking any of them.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Her tone is unrepentant. Annelise is an evolutionary biologist, and she dislikes the niceties of human behavior. We\u2019re all too fast-moving for her.\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a spaceship. Also, do you have to use every pot we own to make dinner with?\u201d My voice is sharper than I mean.\n\u201cWhen someone else is washing dishes? Yes.\u201d Again, no contrition. I used to love the way you never apologized. \u201cI\u2019m going to go see if they\u2019ve gotten into the thing yet.\u201d Her bare feet are nearly soundless on the old wood floor of the apartment that was once mine and then ours and now more hers. Over the sink is a small framed photograph: Annelise, her sister, and two cousins. The sun casts harsh shadows under the brims of their hats, but their smiles are wide and bright.\nIt will be weeks before anyone can get close to the object. When it cools off enough that they can send rovers to look at it, they will find that the surface is made of some sort of metal, pockmarked in ways that make little sense.\nEveryone, it seems, wants it to be a spaceship. Nobody knows for certain.\nThat night, on our threadbare couch, a spring pokes me in the back, keeping me awake. Even with the roar of the city below and Annelise\u2019s soft snoring from the bedroom, it\u2019s too quiet.\nNo, it actually starts this way: I am kidnapped from the Budapest airport. I let my guard down. Life seems so much less urgent when nobody is shooting at you.\nIt\u2019s easy. Replace the car driver who was supposed to meet me at the airport. Go towards the hotel but stop in a narrow, cobbled alley. Men with guns slide into the car; I am paralyzed with surprise for a critical moment.\nThen the bag over my head, and darkness for what feels like days.\nI step forward, and I am falling, falling, falling.\nThis is all out of order. I\u2019m sorry.\nThe meteorite opened and something escaped. I was taken from Budapest and driven to a remote location. The non-Roma and the Roma here have been killing each other for centuries.\nThese three things are related.\nMy name is Audra Feher. I was born in Athens to American parents. I work for the international desk of a newspaper based in New York. It is January fourteenth, I am told. I am alive. I am unhurt.\nI do not know who the people are who are holding me captive. I do know that they have an alien. I have seen it.\nWhatever they are telling you, believe them.\nThe alien resembles nothing so much as a damp gray blanket with restlessly moving fringe, darker spots roving its felted-looking back.\nMy hands are cuffed behind my back. The metal has worn sores into my wrists, and my shoulders ache. The alien smells like nothing I\u2019ve ever smelled before, a little like formaldehyde and fresh-cut apples. The man standing next to me has a machine gun. He keeps shifting where he stands.\n\u201cIt will try to touch you,\u201d the man says in heavily Hungarian-accented German. He lowers the muzzle of the gun a little; a reminder, a warning. \u201cHold still.\u201d\nWe are in a damp, concrete-walled cell with one barred window near the ceiling. My feet are bare and ache so badly with the cold. The alien shifts, and moves. It flows like a slug flows, like an underwater creature, bag of water with cilia moving it along.\nIt touches the end of my toe. My big toenail, with chipped polish clinging to it still. Jungle Red, the color is called. Bright red, like arterial blood. I think about this because the alien is touching me and I need to think about something other than how my skin wants to crawl right off of my body.\nIt touches the top of my foot. It\u2019s strangely warm. It tickles a little.\nAnd then\u2014pain. What feels like fire spreads up my leg in a sweeping rush, and I scream. My foot shoots out as I try to shake the fucking thing off of me\u2014\nIt moves far more quickly than I thought possible, withdrawing with a swift and preternatural grace, the dark spots moving more quickly now. The man with the gun grabs my arm and drags me away with him.\nLater, in the cell, I look at my feet. Bright red pinpricks\u2014Jungle Red\u2014show on purplish, bruised skin. My foot throbs.\nIt does not heal. The bruise and the pinpricks remain, even after the pain begins to fade.\nI put things together, little by little.\nOnly the one guard speaks German; the rest speak Hungarian\u2014a language that I can speak only the very basics of. The German talks to me, but only to give me orders. I ask questions and he grunts. They\u2019ve read the books on how to survive hostage situations, too, it seems, and they know all the tricks one does to build rapport with one\u2019s kidnappers. What\u2019s your name? I ask. Where are you from? Why have you taken me?\nIf I were to describe the German in an article, I would say a burly man with dark hair and a sparse moustache, worn hat pulled low over his eyes. I would not mention the way he smells as if he has not bathed in weeks, or the stains on his pants, or the way his eyes flick over me as if I were one of the insects that colonize my cell.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d I wheedle. German is a terrible language to plead in. \u201cHow can I do what you want if I don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d\nHe turns towards me. Narrowed eyes with deep furrows in the corners, a suspicious set to his mouth, I note absently. \u201cYou will see,\u201d he says. \u201cYour government values you.\u201d He grins, briefly, lopsidedly, and then will say no more.\nThe men wear gray camo and tan coats, and boots with cracked leather uppers. Their guns, though\u2014their guns are well-tended. They\u2019ve been at this a while. They grow careless eventually, and one of them walks by wearing a hat with a recognizable emblem on it.\nSome of the men I interviewed for the piece on the killings of the Roma wore pins and badges with that sign on it. One of them had it tattooed on his beefy neck.\nThere were angry letters to the editor, after my piece came out. Angry letters, death threats in my email, the background noise of being a woman who walks into war and walks out with a story. I didn\u2019t think much of it. I didn\u2019t even think I would be returning to Hungary, but a mysterious space object crashed here and my editors wanted a follow-up piece.\nI am here because they want a mouthpiece, or some sort of insurance against attack. The fact that they are . . . feeding me to the alien, if that is what is happening\u2014I suspect that is just because I am a stranger, and my pain means nothing to them. I hear other screams sometimes. Men. I think they\u2019re trying different people, to see what it likes.\nAfter what feels like months, they drag me into a cinderblock room and have me talk to a video camera. They point guns at me. The German tells me what to say.\nI don\u2019t play games with the translation. I\u2019m sure someone in their network speaks English and would know if I slipped a hint about where I think I\u2019m located, the few glimpses I\u2019ve gotten of the trees, the color of the dirt. I also don\u2019t say, I miss you, Annelise.\nYour native environment, Annelise always says. Your biome is war. The words had been fond at first, then less fond, as she realized that even though I would come back to New York and sleep beside her, I was never truly there at all.\nI don\u2019t wonder what she\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t think of her at all, if I can help it.\nThey take me to see the alien, again and again. Sometimes it touches me. Sometimes I just stand and stare at it. I don\u2019t know how they know what it wants. If they know what it wants. It\u2019s cryptic as a sea cucumber, as an anemone.\nSometimes I wake in the middle of the night, the smell of apples and bitter almonds choking me.\nWhen the meteorite\u2014spaceship\u2014opens, something escapes. Nobody sees what, because at that point armed men of unknown affiliation have taken control of the crater that was the crash site. They have shot the guards and taken the scientists hostage. The Hungarian government was in the process of sending in the army when the pitted metal opened and smoke and something else poured out.\nWhen the smoke clears, the armed men as well as whatever had come out are gone. They leave behind the bodies of the scientists.\nAnnelise comes out with me to wait for the taxi on the stoop of our building. She watches the traffic go past, spraying filthy slush onto the sidewalk. I glance at her, once, then again. She\u2019s left her coat upstairs.\n\u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d she says.\nI hear how the oh in home elongates. Hohhme. The Afrikaner way of indicating distance. Something cold threads through my gut. \u201cAre you coming back?\u201d\n\u201cTaxi\u2019s here.\u201d She picks up my suitcase and heads down the steps.\nThere\u2019s a moment after a bomb goes off that is always filled with a profound personal silence, no matter how noisy the aftermath. It is a silence filled with two questions: can I move? and why am I not moving yet?\nSo I move in that silence. I get into the taxi as the driver loads my bags into the trunk. Annelise bends over, makes a circling motion with her hand. I roll down the window.\n\u201cDo me a favor, Audra.\u201d Her dark eyes meet mine, curls gathering beads of mist in them. \u201cGet some help.\u201d\nThen she straightens and bangs once on the roof of the car. The driver slams his door and the taxi lurches into traffic before I come up with a response.\nI crane around to stare out the back window. What do you mean? Help with what?\nAnnelise\u2019s sharp-planed face holds no answers, and all too quickly recedes into the distance.\nLater, after the lights on the plane are turned down for the evening, I close my eyes. After a while, I realize my cheeks are wet.\nOh.\nInstead of sleeping, instead of thinking about Annelise, I draft the beginning of my piece. I give a quick pr\u00e9cis of the region\u2019s bitter history of violence between the Roma and non-Roma, detail the current right-wing disposition of the government, and posit that the appearance of such an immensely valuable space artifact might stir tensions up once more.\nWhen I land in Budapest, I receive a text about the spaceship opening. I am distracted on my way out of the terminal to meet my driver, thinking about how I\u2019m going to have to edit my opening. Not thinking about Annelise, and Durban.\nIt is an explanation, as much as anything is.\nThere are somber bootsteps outside of my cell, low voices sorrowing and angry. I heft myself up and limp to the door, look out the little window. Camouflaged figures walk past, carrying the body of one of their own. One of the men doing the carrying is the German; I recognize the slightly crooked set of his shoulders.\nThe dead man\u2019s feet are bare. The pattern of bruise and livid pinpricks is the same as on my own feet.\nI\u2019m going to die here, I realize, somewhat belatedly.\nOne morning, I open my eyes to thin light filtering in through the window and the word adapt ringing in my mind.\nI sit up, wrap the scratchy blanket around my shoulders. I study my hands. The skin on my knuckles is cracked, seeping blood. Jungle Red is a quarter-moon on my nails. Chipped away, grown out.\nMy nails are a secret calendar. Even if their growth has slowed from malnutrition, even if my periods have stopped, my nails keep track of the days and the months. My nails are a record of this endless, endless winter. My feet and calves are covered with pinpricked bruises.\nPhantom scents tease my nose\u2014burned meat, olives, bathroom cleaner, pine trees. Is it because I\u2019m hungry? Anise and blood. Just hallucinations, I tell myself. I am starving, I am isolated.\nI lie down again, close my eyes, lapse into a fever-chill sleep. I dream about the alien. In my dreams, it is warm, and its cilia are thin and soft as a kitten\u2019s fur.\nAdapt.\nI don\u2019t know what it means until a few days later, when I waken to find that overnight the roof of my mouth has grown a coating of cilia, shifting and seeking against my tongue. It\u2019s revolting. I retch and retch.\nWhen I try to scrape it off with my thumbnail, I nearly pass out from the pain.\nAdapt.\nI forget how to walk and fall forward, gashing open my knees on the concrete of the hall floor.\nWhen I wake the next morning, the wounds have sealed over with a gray substance and the pain is gone. Within three days, they are healed as if they never were.\nI lie awake and stare at the ceiling. I think I can feel thin filaments growing through me, invading me. Everything hurts, from my skin to my bones to the backs of my eyes. I allow myself to think of Annelise, of her smile, of the way my gut clenches when I think of her leaving.\nI\u2019m so cold. What are you doing to me?\nI am back at home, with Annelise. I smell sunlight and dish soap, chemical lemon and Annelise\u2019s own warm scent, the ghost of the soap she uses.\nShe hands me a towel for the dishes. \u201cEvery one of us is colonized by mitochondria. This is just a larger scale, is all.\u201d\nWhen she smiles, her teeth are gray-furred. I scream and wake myself up, sobbing, no, no.\nNem, nem, echoes a male voice distantly, and then a long, agonized scream.\nThe smell of apples fills my sinuses.\nCommunication.\nAdapt.\n\u201cIt is fine,\u201d the German says, his voice harshly accented. \u201cIt is fine.\u201d He lapses into Hungarian. I pick out \u00e9lelmiszer and holnap. Food and tomorrow.\nI am supposed to sit on the floor of this concrete room and wait for the alien to come to me. Lowering myself to the ground is difficult and I fall the last two feet when my legs lose strength. I will have another bruise on my hip, to join the collection.\nThe alien ripples towards me. I read eagerness in its movements, or desperation. I push myself up, put my back to the wall.\nUnder my skin, things move. There are cilia in the back of my throat, now, and the pinpoint of anger in my gut is flaring.\nNot for the first time, I wonder if the alien has any opinions on its situation. It is not exactly a captive, nor exactly in charge. Both of us are stuck here surrounded by humans whose language we don\u2019t understand. Do you even have language? I ask the alien silently. Is language a meaningful concept to you?\nOzone and a horrible artificial cherry smell rise in my sinuses. I choke.\nI am remembering a Roma woman I interviewed, who had lost two children and her husband to the bullets of a vigilante group. I have nothing left. They have taken it all, the translator had said. How can they hate us so much that they kill our children?\nThe alien flows over my outstretched legs, and I shudder, my vision sparkling with pain. Up it goes, onto my lap. I rest my hand on it. Stroke it like a cat.\nAdapt.\nIt wraps around my hand, dark spots moving restlessly. I don\u2019t scream even though my hand and the skin of my thighs feel like they\u2019re aflame. The cilia on the roof on my mouth stir, tickling my tongue. I find myself with my mouth hanging open.\nThen I bend forward.\nIt reshapes itself, extends something like a limb to my lips. How strange I must seem to you, with this wet orifice surrounded by sharp bony projections. I keep my mouth open. Allow it to probe inside.\nI feel the cilia in my mouth jerk in recognition, and light starbursts in my head.\nAnnelise smiles at me.\nI stare at her dumbly. What is the thing she is doing with her\u2014\nMouth, it is a mouth. She is smiling. She is happy, or wishes me to believe she is happy.\nWoodsmoke and rotting seaweed. Understanding. This is like\u2014\nYes. Much like.\nWe dream, the alien and I. Communicating. Adapting.\nTogether.\nI wake on the dirty, cold floor. The alien is pressed against my stomach. Touching it no longer hurts. It is neither warm nor cool, but exactly the temperature of my body.\nI push myself to my feet. I am weak, too weak. The alien\u2019s scent is regretful. It was not supposed to take this long to find a suitable partner. It was nearing the end of its strength.\nWhy me?\nIncomprehension is baby powder and rainwater. We do not entirely know how to speak to one another yet. I bend down and lift the alien. It flows up my arm to drape itself across my shoulders.\nThe German runs away, shouting triumphantly. I don\u2019t need to speak Hungarian to know that he is announcing that I have done it, I have tamed the alien.\nSurely the world will listen to them now.\nI remember the Roma woman\u2019s face, the bitter anger in her eyes. Men like these killed her family. Old hatreds that I have no stake in, or real understanding of. I was just there to report. Just there to observe.\nWar has a habit of drawing us all in, eventually. Even a journalist. Even an alien who came here entirely by accident.\nThe German\u2019s left the door open. Four steps and I am out the door. Step, step, step down the hall. I am unsteady, but I do not stumble.\nThundering footfalls, boots on concrete. At the end of the hall, five men pound into view\u2014the German and four others. One points. Says something in that beautiful language that I do not understand.\nI stand with the weight of the alien on my shoulders. The cilia in the back of my throat are writhing with alarm. I choke as my throat closes, the alien drawing itself together in alarm, its body against mine less like fluid in a sack than a clenched muscle.\nThat is all the warning I have. The men receive none at all.\nFluid sprays from the alien, hitting the men in the face. They fall to their knees, screaming as I stagger, panicking, trying to draw breath and finding no air. I clutch my throat as they spew bright blood from their noses and mouths, then collapse, going silent.\nThen the cilia in my throat release and I draw great lungfuls of air. My heart throbs painfully in my chest, and I am alive. I cannot feel grateful. The alien wraps itself around me in a mockery of an embrace.\nI will never see Annelise again.\nNo, it starts this way: a woman walks out of a bunker and into a snowscape, trees black against a dim evening sky. She carries a thing that looks like a furry blanket with restlessly moving spots. Her feet are bare, and spattered with blood. She does not seem to feel the cold.\nOr perhaps that\u2019s where it ends.\nYour native habitat is war.\nWe walk on, this marooned explorer and I.\nKris Millering is a linguist by training, a tech tinkerer by trade, and a writer and photographer by avocation.

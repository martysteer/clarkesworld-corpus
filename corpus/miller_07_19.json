Only when she got in the cab and told me where she was going and slumped back in the seat, and I looked in the mirror and saw the look of utter exhaustion and emptiness fill her face\u2014only then did it click.\n\u201cYou\u2019re her,\u201d I said, breath hitching.\n\u201cI\u2019m somebody,\u201d she said, weary, clearly gut-sick of having this conversation, but I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Ann Darrow.\u201d\n\u201cThe one and only.\u201d\nAnd maybe I had recognized her, on some unconscious level, because I hadn\u2019t meant to pick up any passengers when I got in my cab and started driving. Friday nights I\u2019d sometimes hit up the Ziegfeld, the Palace, drive in circles to see the movie stars arriving at their premieres, and, later on, leaving, and later still staggering out of their after-parties. Purely recreational, usually, but that night it was downright medicinal. I needed that glamour, those sixty-karat smiles, the wonder in the eyes of the crowd. The lie of a beautiful world.\nBombs were falling, four thousand miles away. Crematoria were being kindled.\nI pulled away from the curb. One of her posters was framed on the wall of the room I rented. The only decorative touch that had followed me through all five of the boarding houses I\u2019d lived in since getting kicked out of the house. Ann Darrow, eyes wide with terror, arm upraised to fend off something monstrous. A massive black outline hulked behind her. Art deco lettering beneath her blared KONG: THE EIGHTH WONDER OF THE WORLD.\n\u201cYou Jewish?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said, tracing my profile in the rearview mirror. \u201cThe nose gave it away?\u201d\n\u201cThe eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only people who look really scared today are Jewish.\u201d\nIt took me an awful long time to say, \u201cThat\u2019s because most people have no idea what horrible things human beings are capable of,\u201d and even once I said it it wasn\u2019t quite right, didn\u2019t quite capture the rich flavor of my fear, my rage.\n\u201cSome of us do,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us know exactly.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Solomon,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat why your radio\u2019s switched off, Solomon?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sorry. Couldn\u2019t stand to hear it one more time. I can turn it back on if you want to listen to something.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of several things I\u2019m trying not to think about tonight.\u201d\nSeptember 1st, 1939. At 4:45 that morning, Germany had invaded Poland. Word was, England and France would be declaring war within the week. Not that anyone expected them to lift too many fingers to save the millions of Jews in Poland.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cForgot to ask\u2014where you heading?\u201d\n\u201cJust drive,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\n\u201cYou coming from a movie premiere?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Women. It had its moments. They love to have notorious floozies and disgraced politicians show up on the red carpet. Who am I to turn down free food and alcohol?\u201d\nNormally, my New York City cabdriver cool prevailed. Even with only five years\u2019 driving under my belt, I\u2019d already had more movie stars in my back seat than there were cross streets in Manhattan. But this was no movie star. No fraudulent sorcerer, whose magic was made up of lighting and makeup and special effects and screenwriting. This was Ann Darrow. This was someone who knew what magic was. Who\u2019d been held in its hand. Who\u2019d been lifted high into the sky by it, and then watched it die.\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said, catching my repeated mirror glances. \u201cYou were there that night. You were in the theater. You\u2019re a baby, you would have been, what, twelve?\u201d\n\u201cTwelve exactly,\u201d I said, startled. Most people pegged me for far older. I\u2019d been driving a cab on New York City streets since I was thirteen, and nobody\u2019d ever batted an eyelash at it. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t in the theater that night.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody tells me they were, I know they\u2019re lying. Swear to god, you add up all the people who\u2019ve told me they were there that night, there were a couple million people in the audience. Place only had a thousand seats, and half of them were empty. People make it seem like Denham was some kind of genius promoter, but that piece of shit was as bad at that as he was at everything else.\u201d\nI had so many questions. For years I\u2019d dreamed of this moment. Now my words were nowhere to be found.\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to know about . . . him.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nShe rolled her eyes.\nShe wasn\u2019t that much older than me. She\u2019d been twenty, when she traveled to Skull Island. But those events, and the six years since then, had accelerated her aging. From her purse, she pulled a bottle and a glass. Not a flask; a glass, in her purse. \u201cYou want a drink, Solomon?\u201d\n\u201cNot while I\u2019m driving.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are your people from, Solomon?\u201d\n\u201cPoland,\u201d I said.\nShe cursed, so softly I couldn\u2019t hear which one. \u201cYou got people over there still?\u201d\n\u201cThree grandparents.\u201d\n\u201cOh, honey,\u201d she said, one hand reaching forward to touch my shoulder.\nShe was kind. That much was true. I\u2019d imagined her in the hold of the ship, comforting Kong in his chains and his seasickness. Backstage, calming him down while tiny men flashed cameras in his helpless face. Eighty stories up, pleading with him to pick her back up, trying to tell him that the airplanes wouldn\u2019t shoot him while he was holding her. Angry at him for not understanding her, or for understanding and not wanting to put her at risk.\n\u201cI never knew them,\u201d I said. \u201cMy parents came over in 1920. For a while their parents were happy to stay where they were, but since stuff\u2019s been getting scary over there we\u2019ve been saving up money to bring them over. Now I can\u2019t really see that happening.\u201d\nWe both watched the next several blocks slide by. Street signals switching, red to green. Crowds throbbing. Laughter. Hunger. None of them carried what she carried, the secrets of something extraordinary.\nNo sense lying: I wanted something from her. I knew it was wrong, to expect anything of a woman who\u2019d spent six years with everyone clamoring for a piece of her, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask, but I could hope. For something\u2014anything\u2014no one else knew. Some piece of him.\nAnn Darrow tipped her head back, to down her drink. Saw something high above. \u201cThere she is,\u201d she whispered.\nThere she was. I didn\u2019t need to crane my neck to look to know what she was seeing. The Empire State Building, showing through the gap between buildings made by 37th Street.\n\u201cThere were no people living on Skull Island,\u201d she said, and chuckled at my shocked expression. \u201cCannibal natives, that was another one of the lies Denham told the reporters, in the weeks before Kong\u2019s debut. He thought it added to the story. Savages menacing the virginal blonde. People eat that shit up, he said. Every time he told the story, it got bigger and crazier. Spiders the size of houses. Pterodactyls. The T. rex was real, but to hear him tell it she had horns and breathed fire and flew. Only Kong stayed the same size.\u201d\n\u201cBecause he was bigger than anything that asshole could dream up.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said, raising her glass again. \u201cHe never hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\nNo New Yorker ever accepted the story Denham tried to spin: Kong the Monster. From the moment he fell he was myth, was legend, the hope and hero of everyone who ever tried to climb up from the grit and filth of our streets while the little people tried to drag them back down. He was ours. Every souvenir stand and tchotchke shop in the city sold Kong figurines, Kong toys. Every Halloween, he was the most popular costume. And practically half the city had one of those lockets around their neck, with a tuft of black fur purporting to be his.\nAll the property damage, all the people who died\u2014no one blamed Kong for that. It wasn\u2019t his fault he was bigger than life, bigger than us, made for a better world than ours. You didn\u2019t blame the flames that burned down your house. You blamed the man who started the fire.\n\u201cIs it true you agreed to be in the movie?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, snorting. \u201cDenham told producers I was on board, but that was a lie.\u201d\nRKO optioned the story, started preparing to make the movie, but the outcry had been immediate, and immense. The Mayor flat-out refused to let them film in his city. Said it\u2019d be like recreating the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire for film. People died. Kong died. And so, so did a part of us. Some things were sacred.\n\u201cSo where were you, Solomon? That night.\u201d\n\u201cHome. Lower East Side. Six families, thirty people, one apartment. One radio. Everybody glued to it.\u201d\nEven over the air, even as a thing described by strangers, our hearts were with him. Little boys pounding our chests. Imagining something strong enough to derail a subway car, to shatter the thickest chains . . . but still too small for this city, for its big buildings and its brutal cops, who had bullets where their hearts should be. Which one of us wasn\u2019t Kong, a king among ants even as they destroyed us?\nWhen he started climbing the Empire State Building, I slowly backed out of the room. Nobody saw me. They weren\u2019t there; they were imagining Kong\u2019s ascent. No one heard me scamper down the stairs.\nI was a kid. This was my city. I\u2019d sprinted its length more times than I could count. I knew how long it would take me to make it to 34th and Fifth. But how fast could King climb to the top? He\u2019d be slowed down by the beautiful woman he carried.\nI never thought he would die. I didn\u2019t imagine it was possible.\nThick crowds kept me from getting onto Fifth Avenue, but I could still see him. A tiny spot so high above us. We heard the airplanes, a distant sound, getting nearer. We\u2019d gasped, as one. We heard the gunfire.\nI didn\u2019t tell Ann any of that. She\u2019d think less of me, if she knew. I\u2019d seen her when she came down to street level again. Bracketed by cops; coat draped over her shoulders. I\u2019d seen the tears streaming down her face, and I\u2019d seen her hate. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d she\u2019d shrieked. No one answered. No one knew.\nAfter Kong, Denham spent three years with his back up against the wall. He was still news for a little while, the Herald-Tribune running interviews headlined \u201cMost Hated Man in New York City Speaks Out,\u201d but before long he was just another one of yesterday\u2019s villains, drinking himself to death beside all the other politicians and businessmen who never let a little thing like morality come between them and money. Everywhere he went, someone wanted to take a shot at him, and Denham\u2019s crippled manhood wouldn\u2019t let him back down from a single one. Until somebody cracked a rib, drove it into some important organ. Even in the hospital he was dialing up journalist numbers he\u2019d committed to memory, offering them exclusives, and even when he told them he was dying they hung up on him.\n\u201cI hate this city,\u201d she said, watching the after-theater crowds spilling off the sidewalk onto the street.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I said. \u201cEven if I also love it.\u201d\nHer eyes, on mine. \u201cThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s it exactly.\u201d\nThe block where Kong landed\u2014they kept it closed off for weeks. Because of the body, at first\u2014a ten-ton corpse was not so easy to cart off\u2014and then because of the crowds. We came by the thousands. Paupers and newsies and dowager empresses gathered on the shattered sidewalk. We stood, alone with our wonder, and wept.\nHow much did he change us? Who would we be, if he\u2019d never come blundering into our lives to show us how full of wonder the world could still be, and how full of cruelty we still were? Vegetarianism skyrocketed, it\u2019s true\u2014papers said 30% of New Yorkers abstained from eating meat now, vs. half of a percent before 1933\u2014and the country passed laws to limit animal cruelty, stop medical testing on mammals, make sure meat animals weren\u2019t mistreated. Kong wasn\u2019t the only reason, he just made a handy symbol of all that was majestic and worthy of respect in animals.\nBut we\u2019d changed in bad ways too. Plenty of people hated the big ape, especially after the city voided all lawsuits for injury and property destruction related to his rampage, calling Kong an \u201cact of God.\u201d Someone shot the gorilla at the Bronx Zoo through the bars of her cage. Not to mention the backlash to the new laws. Big business laying people off, saying they couldn\u2019t make money now that they couldn\u2019t cram chickens into tiny cages and feed them shit. Out-of-work slaughterhouse men butchering pigs in the streets in protest.\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna take money out of your pocket,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can drop me off wherever, go pick up some actual passengers, instead of an old drunk feeling sorry for herself.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, not wanting it to end, not ever. \u201cI was done already.\u201d\nHer eyes, on mine again.\n\u201cYou still on the Lower East Side, Solomon?\u201d\n\u201cUpper West,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou want to take me there?\u201d\nI could have said yes. I could have tried to do what she wanted. But I couldn\u2019t lie to her, not with my words and not with my body. And if I wanted her to share something meaningful with me, some secret she\u2019d kept from everyone else, I couldn\u2019t very well keep any of my own.\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go, Ann Darrow. I\u2019d do anything for you\u2014but if it\u2019s a lover you want, you could probably find plenty of better ones than me.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t get it up?\u201d she snorted, wounded pride vying in her voice with curiosity, at a man who\u2019d make such an admission.\n\u201cNot for women, unfortunately.\u201d\nShe nodded. Looked out the window. An idiotic move, sharing that with her. Stupid of me to think that just because her empathy extended to monsters like Kong, it would reach all the way to monsters like me.\nCentral Park South; a line of tents that marked the entrance to a Hooverville. Men begged. Women walked up to horse-drawn carriages stopped in traffic, demanded money. Word was, only war would end the Depression, and wasn\u2019t that some shit right there? Rich men fucked up so bad they made millions of people poor, and the only way to fix it was to make millions of people dead.\n\u201cGo to the Bronx,\u201d she said. \u201cHunt\u2019s Point. You can start the meter.\u201d\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll always ride free in my cab.\u201d\nFor a while we didn\u2019t speak. I tried to think of ways to do damage control, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. We were what we were, Ann and I, and people treated us accordingly.\nWe crossed the Willis Avenue Bridge. Small houses sprouted all around us, and brand-new apartment buildings. Lots of my family members had moved up here. I\u2019d have been able to afford a real place. But doing so would be giving up on any hope of finding love, finding sex, and I was eighteen years old and I wasn\u2019t ready to do that yet.\n\u201cEverybody wants something from me,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething I can\u2019t give them, because I don\u2019t have it myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, knowing the answer, because it was what I wanted myself.\n\u201cThey want Kong.\u201d\nShe guided me\u2014left, then right, then left again. Deeper into the Bronx\u2019s weird warped topography, so different from Manhattan\u2019s dependable grid. Finally we arrived at blocks and blocks of warehouses. She didn\u2019t know the address, and we got lost a couple times looking for the right one.\n\u201cPark here,\u201d she said.\nI did.\n\u201cFollow me,\u201d she said. And I did. I knew it was stupid. For all I knew her brothers were waiting inside, burly dock worker types who at a word from their spurned sister would gleefully beat me to death. But she was Ann Darrow, and I was as helpless in her hands as she had been in Kong\u2019s, and I still held out hope that she could give me what I wanted.\nAnd, anyway, would death be so bad? Who wanted to live in a world like this, anyway? A world getting its revenge on us, for all the damage we did, and damned if we didn\u2019t deserve it\u2014dust storms stripping the skin off the country; Oklahoma\u2019s entire corn crop mysteriously blighted, according to the radio. A world where Germany invaded Poland and everyone else went about their business. A world that would kill Kong.\n\u201cThis is where he kept him,\u201d she said. I climbed the steps after her. \u201cBefore the Broadway debut. Dumbass Denham\u2014he either forgot or never even realized that he bought the whole damn warehouse. He was as bad with his backers\u2019 money as he was with his own. And after Kong he was so bogged down in debt and lawsuits that this was the least of his thoughts. He died without a will, without heirs. So I guess it\u2019ll stand here until it falls down or the city gets around to foreclosing on it for unpaid taxes.\u201d\n\u201cKong was here?\u201d I whispered.\n\u201cFor three weeks.\u201d She rummaged in her purse. \u201cI had a locksmith switch this out. I\u2019m the only one with a key.\u201d\nThe air in the warehouse was rank, mammalian. Wild. The smell of something uncageable, and caged. I shut my eyes. Breathed deep.\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s him. Not as he was in the wild, of course. Chained, without access to the sea, he couldn\u2019t clean himself properly. And his spirit came damn close to breaking. You can smell that, too. A sourness. But he was stronger than us.\u201d\nI stepped inside, with the same fear and humility as entering synagogue. The walls were blue. So was the floor. And the ceiling.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s . . . \u201d\nI looked down. The blue was a plant, a vine that had grown to cover every surface.\n\u201cGorillas are vegetarians,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d I\u2019d read a lot about gorillas in the months after Kong fell. Dreamed of being a zoologist, except that you needed to be able to afford to go to college for that.\n\u201cKong ate plants. So he had seeds, in his belly. Nobody but me noticed that something had sprouted from his dung. I potted it, kept it secret.\u201d\nI nodded.\n\u201cI made clippings,\u201d she said, and gave me a small terra-cotta pot. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\nUp close I could see spearhead-shaped leaves. Red veins spread out in curls and ripples. Vines trailed down the side, ending in fat seed pods. At the center of the pot the leaves curled inward, numerous and beautiful as the petals on a chrysanthemum.\nA piece of him. Of Kong.\n\u201cWatch the center,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd be very quiet.\u201d\nI watched. I was quiet. I was patient. The pattern of the veins was so intricate. Hypnotic, almost. So much so that I could have sworn I saw one vine growing while I watched. But of course no plant grew so fast.\nThe leaf-petals parted, suddenly. Like an eye opening. And beneath the petals: an actual eye. Not human, but not far from it, either. All brown iris, and black pupil. It blinked, twice, twitched around as the eye scanned the sky. Then found mine. Held my gaze.\n\u201cIs that his?\u201d\nAnn nodded. \u201cThe plant took something, passing through him.\u201d\nI held the pot in my hands. Reverent; apologetic. Unworthy.\n\u201cI planted some in a vacant lot next to my building,\u201d she said. \u201cNear some kudzu. Came back that afternoon and it had totally swallowed up the kudzu. Would have covered the whole lot in a day if I hadn\u2019t clipped it back.\u201d\nHer eyes were on me. Wanting something. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t . . . \u201d\n\u201cWe killed him,\u201d she said. \u201cWe saw him, this god, this king, and the only thing we could think to do was capture and chain and kill it. That\u2019s what people are. You see that, don\u2019t you? I know you do. It\u2019s why I brought you here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d I said, looking back and forth between her eyes and the plant\u2019s. \u201cBut I don\u2019t . . . \u201d\n\u201cSkull Island was rough. Anything that evolved to survive there would be the ultimate invasive species. It\u2019d cover the earth, if it got the chance. Choke off all kinds of life.\u201d\nAnd\u2014I got it. I nodded. Said, \u201cWhat a shame that would be.\u201d\n\u201cThe money from my book deal\u2014I spent that on a tour of the USA, and then Europe. Dropped a few seeds wherever I went.\u201d\n\u201cYou spend any time in Oklahoma?\u201d I asked, remembering the news about the blighted corn crop.\n\u201cJust enough,\u201d Ann said. \u201cMaybe you want to help.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, my hands occupied, unable to wipe the tears off my face. Wondering where so many had come from, so fast.\nShe hugged me. She smelled like alcohol and lilacs and I sobbed into her neck.\nI drove back into Manhattan. Headed for the Ziegfeld again. By now the after-parties would be getting out; drunk movie stars needing rides home. Plenty of people hailed me, but I didn\u2019t stop. In the seat where Ann sat was a potted plant.\nKong was my passenger. He always had been. I\u2019d carried him in my heart since the moment I watched him fall, felt the earth shake, the sidewalk shatter, my heart with it. All of our hearts.\nOn the corner of 54th and Seventh, I saw a woman leaning on a streetlamp. Dressed up; holding a high heel under her arm while she rubbed that stockinged foot. Her day had been long, and hard. She was angry. She was going to do something about it. Most people probably wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, but I could. Now. How mighty she was. What heights she could climb to. How she could shatter the world with the seeds she carried inside her.\nSam J. Miller is a writer and a community organizer.

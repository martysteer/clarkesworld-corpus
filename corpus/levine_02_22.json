The deep, the ether, the black, the void\u2014an ever-expanding collection of inapt metaphors. Even with the farthest stars finally within reach, humankind had yet to coin a phrase that truly captured the nature of being lightyears away from all known sentient life. This was unsurprising, as few would suffer the degree of isolation necessary to comprehend the experience.\nStill, Cameron cursed whoever had labeled it \u201cthe infinite.\u201d It was the promise of the infinite that drew her to this post, and what those who had invented that euphemism did not convey\u2014what she had not understood when she volunteered\u2014is that no matter how long you flew, you were only as far away as you traveled. It was always possible\u2014in theory, if not in practice\u2014to reverse course and return to echoes of the lives you\u2019d left behind. If the far regions of space were truly \u201cthe infinite\u201d that Cameron was promised, she should have been able to\u2014by some miracle of time and velocity\u2014leave all her problems behind. But that was not the nature of the universe. The harsh realities of physics were always there to remind you that no matter how distantly you wandered, you were always tethered to the point from which you left, like debris caught in orbit.\nOr so she guessed. She reflected on this as she took her forehead off the frosty viewport. Technically, her journey had yet to take her beyond the rim. But how different could it be? Caught in the wandering time bubble of travel at relativistic speeds, wasn\u2019t all of space the same? Anything not traveling at relativistic speeds swirled into an inchoate blur, a vortex of nonentities and nonimages. She imagined that the loneliness of the voyage ahead would be indistinguishable from her last few years. Travel had already failed to detach her in the ways she had hoped. Perhaps it\u2019d come with time. She\u2019d spent so little of it\u2014clocking just three years in transit\u2014while those behind had surrendered so much. She wasted a few more moments staring into the rainbow streaks outside before meandering back to the pilot\u2019s seat.\nShe wondered if it was anticipation of her destination that had brought on this awful melancholy. After three years of repetition, shouldn\u2019t she be desperate for change? But there was comfort in the monotony of her world-outside-of the-world\u2014cruel safety to her isolation. Soon, she\u2019d arrive at Starbase Orion VI and a station officer would offer her a summary of the ninety years she had wriggled out of through this assignment. The government-mandated prep course said most pilots took it hard. But wasn\u2019t the time slip why she did this in the first place?\nAn advocacy movement had sought a ban on travel at relativistic speeds for exactly such reasons\u2014and worse ones. Behavioral scientists formed an unstable coalition with religious groups and activists whose loved ones had disappeared into the ether of time. But it was too useful for the state and its ruler-beneficiaries to relinquish, so a compromise was struck: the use of solo missions to minimize involved personnel, always preceded by psychiatric evaluation. The solitary nature hadn\u2019t concerned her\u2014there was a certain appeal\u2014and the second was a formality. Everyone who volunteered for a near-c mission was at least a little unwell; candidates and graduates simply shared the work of deriving correct answers. Anyone applying already knew what to say.\nYes, I understand what I\u2019m getting into. No, I have no dependents. No, nothing left unsaid. Yes, I understand what I\u2019ll lose. I\u2019ve participated in the preparatory programs and planned strategies for coping with grief. I\u2019m confident it\u2019s the right decision. In fact, I\u2019m excited for a fresh start and the opportunity to serve humankind.\nShe figured that by now, the psychiatrists knew as well as the candidates that the answers were routine. Scripted. They were, after all, also just people with jobs. Why trouble themselves with concern for these self-sabotaging misfits? Better to check the boxes, keep moving, go home. Cameron could understand the desire to keep moving, if not the sensation of home.\nHome. She ran her hand over the nav-con, rechecking her deceleration trajectories. Slowing without fuel left to burn necessitated an intricate web of orbital grav-brakes. The route was preplanned, but even space was subject to entropy and every pilot needed to nudge their flight pattern at least once. Missing a brake could add decades to your trip\u2014cut from the world outside of your bubble, of course. Readouts . . . green. No work to do. She sighed. She\u2019d have to think of home, then.\nFunny that she still called it that. If anything, this ship seemed a better candidate for the term. But just as your birthplace was always your \u201chometown,\u201d she unavoidably associated the word with her planet of origin. Earth. The farthest departure point from which you could leave for the rim. Nine decades, or just about\u2014a couple years were within the margin of error at speeds of this scale. Enough time that everyone capable of remembering her would be gone. For the better, right? For them, and her.\nShe thought of her biological family\u2014an easy way to avoid more difficult subjects. Her parents were probably furious when they heard. They had still dreamed of a relationship, one day. But they\u2019d made their choices, and she\u2019d made hers. Her brothers hurt worse. She had written to them, before the end. She struggled with how much it resembled a different sort of note\u2014a type she had also drafted many times. She hoped this had been less painful to read. She reassured herself that near-c disappearance must be softer than death. Cameron maintained a curiosity about their reactions but was in-flight before anyone\u2019s replies would have arrived\u2014quite on purpose. Otherwise, could she have followed through?\nFriends flitted through her mind, but none felt important enough to dwell on. Who had even been left? With luck, they\u2019d never have learned of her leaving. From their perspective, she disappeared years before her departure, either pushed out or run from, vanishing to sabotage different relationships, distant enough to leave them unaffected. Or so Cameron had planned. (Don\u2019t tell the psychiatrists.)\nFinally\u2014after considering coworkers, teachers, acquaintances, and anyone else she recalled\u2014she had exhausted the buffer that shielded her from thoughts of Melissa. First: the two of them in bars and basements and the meetings and sick visits, which Mel had sailed through in an endless chain. A whole room laughing at some grim joke Cameron cracked. These were the nice memories\u2014but they didn\u2019t last. Her departure was like a black hole. Its gravity pulled her in.\nSomeone must have told her. Maybe Melissa even investigated it herself, in some moment of weakness. Cameron felt embarrassed that she treasured the idea. She\u2019d spent enough time darting stealthily over established boundaries to harm herself with knowledge of her ex\u2019s new life. Was it unfair that Melissa would never know about her\u2019s? Cameron\u2019s so-called \u201cfresh start\u201d? Did Mel purse her face in concern when she learned of Cameron\u2019s plans? Her lips curling the same way they always did? Or had years worn away that mannerism, or proffered enough detachment that Cameron\u2019s outlets for self-destruction no longer distressed Melissa enough to\u2014\nThe vidscreen flashed yellow. Cameron creased her lips in a grim approximation of a smile. Her final grav-brakes were approaching and, gracefully, the nav-con was concerned that stellar flares would interfere with instruments enough to compromise her flight path. Monitoring and possible intervention would be necessary. Despite the danger, she felt grateful for the attention it demanded. She\u2019d have enough time to dwell when the station sent her arrival dossier. She wanted another focus until then. A wish mercifully granted.\nLeaving the ship, her eyes wandered, appraising the novelty of a view deviating from the walls of her ship and the way the horizon neglected to blur with motion, instead painting a static portrait from which she could pinpoint the finest details. She stood captivated until the bay attendant exited his booth and welcomed her. A human voice, addressing her directly. How strange.\n\u201cHello, Commander Klein, welcome to Orion VI. Before you apologize, it\u2019s fine if your small talk leaves something to be desired. I\u2019ve greeted plenty of arrivals, and I know a couple years alone leaves your conversational skills rusty.\u201d He offered a sheepish smile. She found the playfully rude greeting endearing\u2014though he benefited from the desperation for conversation left by three years of solitude.\n\u201cHi, uh . . . \u201d She checked his nameplate and epaulettes. \u201cSpecialist Reno. Thanks for the, uh, warm welcome. I\u2019ll try to put together something interesting to talk about.\u201d She grimaced. He was right. Playful banter seemed to have exited her wheelhouse.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that, I won\u2019t be around long. Temp lodging is around the corner, and you\u2019ve got a room reserved. Pilots usually want their dossiers right away. We like to have private space ready.\u201d He gave her a look of sympathy. She found it frightening.\n\u201cAbout that . . . I didn\u2019t receive the advance copy after my last grav-brake. That doesn\u2019t match protocol. Did something go wrong?\u201d\n\u201cOh, not at all. Let\u2019s see, when did you leave . . . wow, 2067? You must\u2019ve come all the way from Earth. Yeah . . . protocols have changed. We discovered it\u2019s better that pilots are landed before we allow a peek. Happened around . . . \u2019126? Believe me, it\u2019s hard enough to take it this way. Some other pilots can tell you what it was like before.\u201d He shuddered. \u201cWe even lost a few that way.\u201d\nShe bit the inside of her lip. You always underestimate how it is going to impact you, she heard her preparatory course instructor repeating. She ran his statement back, raising a cascade of other questions. Some she could answer; \u201cwhy?\u201d seemed evident enough. You don\u2019t want a pilot trying to land while grieving whoever they cared about back home. Some questions, though, stumped her.\n\u201cIf protocol changed in 2126, how would I ask a pilot? There\u2019s no way they\u2019d get back from a rimward boomerang in only . . . \u201d She trailed off, realizing she hadn\u2019t yet asked\u2014\n\u201cThirty-six years,\u201d he replied, answering what she left unspoken. She added in her head. It was 2162. Five years over. Not bad. \u201cTo your other question . . . well, the timing of your dossier isn\u2019t the only protocol that\u2019s changed. I, uh . . . I think it\u2019s better you start there, then we\u2019ll talk mission, ok?\u201d His hand offered a data drive. She could tell he was struggling to hold something back. He was too emotive a person to keep a straight face. Her curiosity about his gift, however, outweighed her desire for an immediate answer.\n\u201cJust around the corner, you said?\u201d\n\u201cRoom number Hotel Seven, Commander.\u201d\n\u201cHotel, that\u2019s kinda\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that one before.\u201d He chuckled, but it was empty. His jovial manner had disappeared. Quickly. Her brow furrowed. She didn\u2019t like whatever that implied.\nJoseph Klein - Deceased age 90\nRachel Klein - Deceased age 86\nBen Klein - Deceased age 34\nAaron Klein - Deceased age 92\nAlexis Klein - Deceased age 86\nHannah Klein-Sherman - Age 71\nTara Klein-Sherman - Age 68\nRachel Klein-Sherman - Age 42\nThe names and numbers told a series of stories, laid before her like a weird novelization of the peripheries of her life. She wondered avoidantly what it was like to prepare these dossiers. She imagined they were hand-assembled; how would a computer sieve through a century and determine what in a person\u2019s life was important enough to highlight from their absence? Cameron\u2019s finger hovered over each name, but reaching the end disinterestedly, she was forced to confront the desire she had been orbiting all along. A name that would appear nowhere in her dossier\u2014the state never had impetus to recognize their relationship. She swiped out of the meticulously prepared document.\n\u201cMelissa Serwer.\u201d The search results were endless.\n\u201cMelissa Erin Serwer,\u201d cut infinity in half, down to infinity.\n\u201cMelissa Erin Serwer 5/12/2038.\u201d Funny how easily Cameron remembered her birthday. Haha.\nWe mourn the passing of Melissa Erin Serwer, age 89\u2014\nEighty-nine, Cameron repeated as she paused, eyelids falling. She pictured Melissa at eighty-nine. The tan of her skin cracked with age. Her hair, once black, now gray. Or had she dyed it? Back to black? Neon again, in imitation of youth? She didn\u2019t know. She could probably find a picture. That wouldn\u2019t really solve it though. She still wouldn\u2019t understand why that choice. How could she even be sure that this Melissa was really the same Melissa she had known\u2014\nShe exhaled sharply, clenched her teeth, and resumed.\n. . . who passed peacefully on September 30th, 2127.\nGood. She deserved that.\nShe was a pillar of her community, and her presence will be sorely missed.\nCameron smiled mournfully. Yeah, the same Melissa.\nWe dedicate in her honor the Melissa Serwer Municipal Creditary, which will continue to shelter those who she no longer can take under her wing.\nCameron didn\u2019t understand what exactly a \u201cmunicipal creditary\u201d was, but on the face, it seemed like a proper honor for the person she had known. She read on, through a familiar recounting of the woman\u2019s childhood, then the records of her plentiful efforts to provide communal care.\nMelissa is survived by her wife Olivia\u2014\nOh. She had married. Of course. Who wouldn\u2019t have wanted to\u2014\n. . . her wife Olivia Aral Bennett\u2014\nWait, Olivia Bennett? Liv? The chuckle broke open her pursed lips. Reunited with her ex, huh? Funny, Cameron wouldn\u2019t have thought it possible to\u2014The chuckle hiccupped, fractured by the labored breathing of a sob, and she tossed the tablet across the bunk. It bounced and collided with the wall, and she swore. This was\u2014She couldn\u2019t\u2014She needed air. She pressed off the bed and out the door.\nBlundering down the hallway, it took Cameron three steps to collide with another resident. As they tumbled to the floor, she realized it was her most intimate human contact in years and laughed at herself out of pity. While they disentangled, she inspected the thorough wrinkles on the woman\u2019s dark skin. Great, her first act on the station was to injure an old woman. She turned upward and found the stranger staring back with odd fascination. Her face was unfamiliar, but something about the shape of the eyes and their particular shade of brown nagged Cameron\u2019s memory like a glitched notification.\n\u201cCameron?\u201d the woman asked, voice thick with trepidation. Cameron, for her part, stumbled back onto the floor. How did this woman recognize her? Maybe it was procedure now to distribute a photo of new arrivals, so you could greet them?\nThen she placed the eyes. Dragged her gaze down the jawline, accounted for sagging skin, adjusted height for the spinal compression of age . . .\n\u201cRobin?\u201d Cameron replied, her question beset by disbelief. The woman laughed heartily. It was earnest, and familiar.\n\u201cNobody has called me \u2018Robin\u2019 in quite some time, kiddo. I\u2019m usually Ms. Walker. Wow, it\u2019s really you, isn\u2019t it? You haven\u2019t aged a day.\u201d\nThe woman\u2019s voice was frail and wavering. That was different. The Robin she\u2019d known was resolute, full of confidence and bluster. And . . . \u201ckiddo\u201d?\n\u201cThree years, actually, but people always said I seemed young for my age,\u201d Cameron offered, unsure of the protocol for meeting a friend who appeared to have gained fifty years on you since you last saw them, say, four years ago.\n\u201cSo basically a day then,\u201d Robin said and repeated that familiar laugh. Cameron felt warm. \u201cMy, it\u2019s really you. What are the chances? For heaven\u2019s sake, what does that matter?\u201d She paused just a moment too long. \u201cI\u2019ve lost too much to be anything other than thankful. Just c\u2019mere.\u201d The old woman pulled Cameron into a bear hug.\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . \u201d Cameron tried to find words, but her specialty had always been humor, not the heartfelt. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you, Robin. Or, uh, Ms. Walker? What do you . . . I don\u2019t really know how you\u2019re supposed to do this . . . \u201d\nRobin smiled. \u201cNone of us do. That\u2019s what passes for excitement around here. Just Robin, please. It\u2019s strange to hear that title on your young lips. Oh, you look just the same . . . except paler, somehow.\u201d She grabbed Cameron\u2019s cheek with leathery finger pads, and Cameron\u2019s brow furrowed. She found the mannerisms surreal. Unquestionably her old friend, now her old friend. How long had Robin been aboard the station? And why? Robin cut into the shocked silence.\n\u201cMake sure to spend some time in the dome, where the sun\u2019ll reach you. The radiation can\u2019t be any worse than the godforsaken dark of near-c!\u201d She struck Cameron\u2019s practically blanched forearm playfully.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have a chance. I\u2019m planning to head out for my boomerang as soon as they\u2019ll authorize it. Which brings me to the real question . . . why the hell are you here?\u201d Robin regarded her with suspicion. No, confusion? Her brows were knit tight, searching for something. Then they broke into an expression of pure pity\u2014Cameron wanted to hide. Robin spoke softly.\n\u201cOh, space . . . \u201d\n\u201cSpace\u201d was a swear now?\n\u201c . . . you haven\u2019t heard, have you?\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t heard what?\u201d Cameron replied, now heavy with anticipation.\n\u201cI told Archie to move the world history section before family, but noooooo . . . \u201d She drew out the \u201co\u201d sarcastically. The artifact of an argument exhaustively rehearsed. She continued mockingly. \u201cThe pilots will just skip it and move on to their families anyway. Well at least preserve the possibility that they won\u2019t!\u201d Cameron wrapped her fingers around Robin\u2019s knobbly wrist insistently.\n\u201cWhat haven\u2019t I heard?\u201d Cameron locked her gaze onto the woman\u2019s, now sure that it was Robin. Her eyes were unmistakable, untouched by the strange wonders of time.\n\u201cRelativistic travel has been banned. No one \u2018boomerangs\u2019 anymore.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nCameron staggered. She blinked repeatedly, and her friend broke Cameron\u2019s grip and grasped Cameron\u2019s shaking hands. The look on Robin\u2019s face was one of comfort\u2014or was it pity again? Robin continued.\n\u201cOr at least, rimward relativistic travel. You can still fly near-c toward the core. Once. They don\u2019t usually give a second authorization.\u201d\nCameron simply kept blinking. She couldn\u2019t make sense of it. The boomerang was the whole reason she\u2019d come out here. To go! To leave! To escape this awful system and everything it tangled her up in! Her family, her lovers, her so-called \u201cfriends\u201d\u2014and for what it was worth, that very fucking much included Robin Walker! \u201cNo,\u201d she mouthed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she sputtered breathlessly, and pulled herself out of the old woman\u2019s feeble grip. The footfalls of her escape echoed painfully off the metal. The world blurred again.\n\u201cCameron, where are you going?\u201d her old friend\u2014ex-friend?\u2014called out. \u201cCameron, don\u2019t run away! There\u2019s more to it, just let me\u2014\u201d Cameron didn\u2019t stop. She was nearly out of earshot and couldn\u2019t get there fast enough. She\u2019d find the CO\u2019s office and sort this out immediately. \u201cCameron! Cameron, just\u2014don\u2019t run!\u201d\nShe ran.\nThe engraving on the wall plate read \u201cLt. Archibald Richards\u201d in stark lettering. A thick coat of rust enveloped it, cut by telltale lines of ineffective scouring long since given up. She burst through the door angrily before she could inspect anything else.\n\u201cLieutenant, I need authorization for a rimward near-c, and I don\u2019t honestly give a flying fuck what policies have changed, I was promised a\u2014\u201d\nThe man looked up from underneath the balding crown of his head, peering over his spectacles. His quiet reply interrupted her demand. It managed to cut her off, despite the volume.\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what you give a flying fuck about, Commander. Would you like to try that introduction again?\u201d\nThe hunched, sour-looking man sat behind a desk the same steel-gray as the station. A tacky Newton\u2019s Cradle sat motionless next to his tablet on the desk\u2019s otherwise barren top. Cameron stamped a foot and tried to screw her head back on.\n\u201cYes Sir, sorry Sir. It\u2019s just . . . a big shock, Sir. And frankly, it\u2019s unfair. I gave my fucking life for this mission. They can\u2019t just strand me out here in limbo\u2014\u201d\nHe cut her off again, with the same steady calm.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll find, Commander, that \u2018they\u2019 can do whatever they damn well please. This \u2018limbo,\u2019 as you call, it is my home\u2014gods be damned\u2014and as you\u2019ll soon accept, yours too.\u201d The look on his face wasn\u2019t quite reproach. He regarded her more like a minor annoyance. A fly, buzzing too close to his ear.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Sir! This is just a fucking truck stop! You can\u2019t live here! I have somewhere to be! I was promised!\u201d She knew she shouldn\u2019t swear like this to a commanding officer. She knew her temper was out of control, but who could expect anything else from her under the circum\u2014Wait, commanding officer? He was a lieutenant! His demeanor had put her off balance, but he wasn\u2019t her superior! She should be giving the orders! \u201cAnd as a matter of fact, I outrank you. So prepare my launch. That\u2019s an order, Lieutenant!\u201d\n\u201cListen up, Klein, and listen well, as I don\u2019t like to repeat myself, because \u2018repeating\u2019 is all I ever fucking do here. Welcome to Orion VI, one of many \u2018truck stops\u2019 the Union has left abandoned to rust on the edge of human civilization. There\u2019s no travel rimward. Hasn\u2019t been for thirty years. Just after the start of my tenure, of course. There\u2019s no travel coreward without authorization, either. There\u2019s a hab-dome, complete with seventy-eight trees and as many treadmills as you damn well want. The sights are beautiful, I\u2019m told. I suppose they were, for a few years. Speaking of years, even with the latest communicators\u2014which of course, we don\u2019t have out here\u2014it takes a decade to get a databurst back and forth from Representation on Earth. Oh, you probably remember them as Command. Regardless, you\u2019ll hear from them maybe . . . \u201d\nHe paused to inspect her, adjusting his cartoonishly small glasses, then continued \u201c . . . five times, before you die. That\u2019s your chain of command. If you have an issue with my orders, take it up with them. Of course, it\u2019ll stop being relevant long before they get back to you, so you can think of me as your Representation. Or, if you prefer, you can think of me as God. Not much difference out here. I\u2019ve run Orion for thirty years, and just because they\u2019ve repeatedly declined to use their precious communiques for an overdue promotion doesn\u2019t mean I have to take shit from some upstart Commander who just tripped out of their twenty-first century clunker. My word here is law, and worth a lot more to the people on this station than the stripes on your shoulders. You\u2019ll get used to it, \u2018Commander.\u2019 You\u2019re not the first angry pilot to march in here.\n\u201cBy all damnable accounts, you\u2019ll be the third from last. The last pilot they\u2019ve imprisoned me to wait for is estimated to arrive, oh, about five years after the actuaries predict that I\u2019ll be dead. That\u2019s my \u2018service to humankind.\u2019 Now, I recommend you leave this room, cool off, and attempt this conversation another day. Try the hab-dome. Meet your new family. I\u2019m sure the other seven will be enthused to see you. I\u2019ve certainly had an exciting morning. Enjoy Orion VI, Lieutenant. Get out of my sight.\u201d He looked back down to the tablet, returning to a simple game in which you bounced balls off a paddle to break blocks. The screen was worn where a finger would drag to move the paddle. She looked at him.\n\u201cBut Sir\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOut,\u201d he replied forebodingly, and she turned, trying not to let him see her huff\u2014more out of pride than good sense. She left.\nThe hab-dome was beautiful. Beeches and maples formed a thick green canopy. Sitting along the dirt paths underneath, it would have almost been possible to forget that she was on a metal space station lightyears from any habitable planets. Cameron didn\u2019t want to forget, and so she leaned against the wall at the rim of the dome, staring up through the glass hexagons at the off-white glow of the moon towering overhead. She sat on the floor, elbows on her knees in the resigned posture of a woman with all of her anger spent. She couldn\u2019t deny the view was breathtaking, but it didn\u2019t comfort her.\nRobin approached with caution and silently lowered herself to the floor alongside Cameron. Her bones creaked as she struggled to the ground. She set her head on Cameron\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you took my advice. The trails are nice, but you need sunlight\u2014however many times it bounces to get here.\u201d Robin rapped Cameron\u2019s skin with her knuckles, but it was half-hearted. Cameron didn\u2019t respond. The older woman tried a different tack.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it, I promise. It\u2019s not all bad here.\u201d\nCameron exhaled sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t try to comfort me.\u201d\n\u201cOK. Stop moping then,\u201d Robin replied with a sparkle in her eye. Cameron turned to look at her.\n\u201cMy one plan to escape got crushed by some unknown bureaucracy while I camped out in a metal box for three\u2014one hundred\u2014whatever years.\u201d\nRobin looked directly at her.\n\u201cTo escape what?\u201d\nCameron turned away.\n\u201cC\u2019mon. You know.\u201d\nShe felt Robin shift and could feel the gaze on the back of her head.\n\u201cIndulge an old woman. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d\nIt was so easy to forget that.\n\u201cJust going as far as Mel wanted me to, y\u2019know.\u201d\nWhen Robin scoffed, Cameron turned to her with her face knitted in shock and as much fury she could muster. Her question was raw: \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIs that really what this was about, Cameron?\u201d\n\u201cOf fucking course it was! Is! Don\u2019t you know, I\u2019m not safe to be around. Can\u2019t be trusted to take care of myself. Refuse to change. Refuse to take help. I lash out and drag others down with me. If Melissa fucking Serwer is done with me, what goddamn hope is there? You should know, you dropped me like a hot wrench when she went public with it!\u201d\nRobin sat up. The movement clearly took effort. She settled her gaze on the younger woman.\n\u201cMelissa Serwer is dead, Cam.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Exactly how I wanted it. They\u2019re all dead. I\u2019m dead, as far as they were concerned. Mel started it. I just took it to the logical conclusion.\u201d\n\u201cCameron Klein, the poster girl for logical thinking.\u201d The sarcasm felt nice. More familiar than the unexpected empathy and worse yet, pity, which had oozed from the woman since their reunion. \u201cYou think Melissa wanted you dead?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, not\u2014she wouldn\u2019t\u2014what was I supposed to do? I lost everyone.\u201d\n\u201cYou were supposed to get better.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, how the hell was I supposed to do that alone?!\u201d\nRobin was perfectly calm as she stared, unblinking, at Cameron. Her voice was level.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t a good idea. Or fair to you.\u201d\nCameron sat, stunned into silence. Blinked, pursed her lips, then pursed them differently. Words came and went without ever passing her throat. Robin spoke into the space.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard that, have you? It feels so long ago to me. I just assumed . . . that\u2019s silly of me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Cameron stopped, and suddenly she was furious. Tears streamed from her eyes and her words were split by rasping breaths. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you fucking say it to me while you had the chance?!\u201d\n\u201cYou left before any of us thought to. Before we could learn better. That part\u2019s on you.\u201d\nCameron closed her mouth again, face flushed and embarrassed. She turned back toward the moon, placing the crown of her head against the wall and closing her eyes. She spoke without opening them.\n\u201cWhat do you mean, we?\u201d\n\u201cDo you think Melissa died angry at you?\u201d\nCameron had never considered this question\u2014she, too,had assumed. Robin watched her and replied to the unspoken words.\n\u201cOne of life\u2019s cruelest lessons is that time heals more wounds than just about anything else. It leaves a scar of course, but people grow as well as skin. I don\u2019t think anyone left that planet thinking about what a bastard Cameron Klein was. Now, don\u2019t think we forgave you. You don\u2019t get off that easy. You didn\u2019t stay long enough to earn it. Still . . . I\u2019d bet plenty of us regretted how we handled it, when we thought about it . . . I did, eventually.\u201d\nCameron\u2019s vision tunneled.\n\u201cWhy would you have been thinking about me, Robin?\u201d she asked with defensive hurt.\n\u201cBecause I lied to you earlier.\u201d\nCameron finally opened her eyes and leaned forward, legs crossed, palms flat on the cold floor.\n\u201cI knew this was too good to be true.\u201d\nRobin shook her head, pityingly.\n\u201cNot about that, Cam. About . . . not expecting to see you.\u201d\nCameron recoiled backward and inhaled.\n\u201cWait, did you . . . follow me?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly. Kind of. I . . . wish I could say I\u2019d done it just to give you this overdue apology, but . . . you\u2019re not the only one who wanted to leave, Cameron. Not the only one boneheaded enough to try, either.\u201d\n\u201cBut why me? You didn\u2019t\u2014we weren\u2019t even friends anymore. Not really.\u201d\n\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t have a lot of options. Because I . . . also wanted to make myself disappear. But I chickened out. Couldn\u2019t. I got to the end and couldn\u2019t stand the thought of being alone forever. I needed something to tether me. Someone. I saw the records. There aren\u2019t many near-c pilots, but . . . there was your name. I had one way to leave it all without leaving it all. So I took a route through Orion VI. Didn\u2019t do me much good, of course. I didn\u2019t think through the margins of error, how much shorter my trip would be given advances in relativistic travel . . . thirty-one years is a long time to undershoot. It\u2019s been lonely, but I\u2019ve made do with the people here, and learned a lot about what it means to spend time with yourself. Back to your question, though. Sorry, but I made a tool out of you, Cameron. I wanted a lifeline. Someone to find me while I . . . \u201d She paused, consternation visible. Searching for proper words and giving up.\n\u201c . . . while I lay bleeding out in the tub.\u201d\nCameron didn\u2019t know what to say. She shook, unbelieving. Time seemed to dilate. She felt like she was back on her ship, in her bubble outside the world. After an indeterminate while, she spoke one word. The same question. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d\nCameron nodded, face bewildered. Now Robin turned upward, moonlight brightening her cheeks.\n\u201cI lost someone. Got \u2019em killed, maybe. And you think you carry sins . . . \u201d The old woman trailed off and took a centering breath, clearly practiced. \u201cThought I could run from it. Thought I couldn\u2019t live without her. Wrong on both counts, of course. Y\u2019know why they banned near-c?\u201d\nCameron didn\u2019t respond.\n\u201cWhen suicide prevention groups collated the numbers, it was clear who these missions preyed on. After the revolution, Representation decided that even collectively, we weren\u2019t wise enough to handle the responsibility of deciding who should and shouldn\u2019t get to disappear forever. They were right, too.\u201d\nCameron opened her mouth to snap angrily, but Robin put her hand up and kept speaking.\n\u201cThirty-five isn\u2019t that much older than twenty-four, in the end. I was closer to your age than mine when I decided there was no reason worth staying. Thirty-seven when I got here. The last three decades have given me a long time to think. But clocks go one way, even if they move at different speeds. I can never rearrange it and do all that processing before the moment I made the decision.\u201d\nCameron laughed rudely.\n\u201cProcessing. Melissa liked to \u2018process.\u2019 Didn\u2019t make her \u2018grow\u2019 any faster. Didn\u2019t change her mind before I\u2014\u201d\nRobin cut her off.\n\u201cBefore you chose to give up on her. On all of us. Most of all, on yourself. As far as Melissa\u2019s growth, you don\u2019t know anything about it. You weren\u2019t there. You don\u2019t know that it didn\u2019t help. You didn\u2019t stay to find out. Neither of us did, for our own disasters. I know you\u2019re hurting, and it\u2019s fresher for you. But you\u2019re not the only one who screwed this up, or the only one hurting. I can give you time, Cam\u2014however much I have left. But eventually you gotta take yourself out of the center. For the lord\u2019s sake, I just told you I got someone I love killed and all you can do is whine about Mel. I\u2019ve waited a long time to talk to someone who remembers even some of our world, but our relationship has to be a two-way street. If you can\u2019t get out of your own little universe, you\u2019re just gonna burn this one up, too.\u201d\nCameron huffed. She regretted it immediately, but it was too late. She stood. Her shadow fell over the woman, moon bright behind her.\n\u201cNo. No. I\u2014this wasn\u2019t\u2014it can\u2019t be like this. I have to go, Robin. That was the whole point. Sorry I can\u2019t be what you want me to be. I\u2019m sorry, and . . . thanks, and\u2014I have to go.\u201d Cameron didn\u2019t look down. She hadn\u2019t since she stood.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to be anything anymore. I just want someone to talk to. I didn\u2019t exactly pick the people here, and they\u2019re not\u2014I miss the sort of people we surrounded ourselves with. Miss having anyone like me. You can still make this work, Cam.\u201d\n\u201cClocks go one way,\u201d Cameron muttered, and turned to leave. The frail woman looked upward again and waited for the moon to move. She remained for a while.\nRobin barely saw the younger pilot for a month. Given the size of the Orion VI, that couldn\u2019t be an accident. Cameron\u2019s arrival at her door was an inevitable surprise.\n\u201cHello. Good to see you again.\u201d\nCameron didn\u2019t reply\u2014at least not directly. She glanced back and forth furtively, inspecting the hallway. \u201cCan I come in?\u201d\nRobin raised an eyebrow questioningly but nodded. Cameron slipped in quickly and Robin shut the door behind her.\n\u201cSo\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m leaving, Robin.\u201d\nRobin kept her face impassive, with notable effort.\n\u201cThere are no boomerangs anymore. You know that. I know you\u2019re angry and lost, but don\u2019t try to\u2014\u201d\nCameron interrupted her again.\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m going home.\u201d\nRobin inspected her young friend, then took a seat at her desk.\n\u201cWhy? Home isn\u2019t even there anymore.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have to ask? I guess . . . you\u2019ve been here a while. You\u2019re used to it. But I\u2019m not waiting for anyone. There\u2019s no one coming for me. This\u2014\u201d Cameron gestured around, \u201cisn\u2019t a life. I\u2019ve spent a month surrounded by people from a world that might as well be an alien planet and who\u2019ve basically turned into, well . . . zombies\u2014\u201d Cameron looked at Robin and winced. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just\u2014no one here is changing, right? They\u2019re all . . . static. They\u2019ve accepted that this is forever. They don\u2019t even really see me. At least, not my life, or what\u2019s left of it. I\u2019m lonelier here than I was on my ship.\u201d\nRobin regarded her with suspicion.\n\u201cThen why not come see me?\u201d\nCameron hid her face.\n\u201cBecause I was embarrassed. Because you were right, about one thing at least. Maybe two. You were right that this was a stupid idea that I didn\u2019t think through, and right that I shouldn\u2019t mope. But just because you\u2019re old and wise or whatever doesn\u2019t mean you understand me. Home\u2019s just a word, and I never felt like I had one. I\u2019m not going back to find something, but to . . . build it. Figure out what this whole \u2018revolution\u2019 is about. Donate to the Melissa Serwer Municipal Creditary, whatever the hell that is. I may have fucked up and disappeared on everyone I cared about but . . . there\u2019s still something, and I\u2019m not gonna make the same mistake twice.\u201d\nRobin offered a wistful smile and took a moment to appreciate that her world could still contain surprises. Then, she grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you. Really, I am. But . . . \u201d She paused, trying not to shy away from the expectant woman\u2019s gaze. No. She was too old to hold words like these back. \u201cI\u2019ll be lonely here without you. I\u2019ve waited a long time.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here. To get you to come with me.\u201d\nRobin clenched her jaw. She should\u2019ve expected that. She supposed Cameron was right; she had grown used to this. Thoughts of leaving had simply stopped occurring.\n\u201cI\u2019m too old for that sort of thing. And it\u2019s not bad to be used to things.\u201d\nCameron hadn\u2019t sat down. She tapped her foot.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s being all wise and shit worth if you can\u2019t do anything with it. You will be lonely here. Just come with me. We can build something together. I can do all that growing you\u2019ve been talking about. Don\u2019t just sit here. I can\u2019t. And I . . . \u201d\nCameron fidgeted nervously and glanced to the side before continuing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to do it alone, either. I was wrong, okay? Wrong. It sucks. There. I grew. Now . . . will you just come with?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need me. You\u2019ll meet people. And you\u2019ll figure yourself out, just like I did, \u2019cause you have the most important resource of all: time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about need. I don\u2019t want to lose you! Or lose anyone, again. And I don\u2019t think you really want to stay, either.\u201d\nRobin\u2019s head swiveled, searching. She took stock of the paintings\u2014her own\u2014and the gifts from the station\u2019s few inhabitants. Her lone instrument. The sheafs of paper containing countless unfinished drafts. She\u2019d tried a lot of hobbies during her stay. She\u2019d formed disappointingly few relationships\u2014but some, at least. She sighed and thought about a place she hadn\u2019t been in so long. About a life with more people, more surprises. About what Cameron said. The people here are static. She considered the realistically few years she had left. There was no one here who even cared to hear about her life anymore. No one to pass it on. She\u2019d die here among half-written novels, and so would the ghosts of the life she had stupidly thrown away. She stared at Cameron and imagined her fading into the final ghost. No. She\u2019d thrown away too many lives. She shook herself and tried to think through the offer.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry? Even coreward, we need authorization. I\u2019m sure Archie told you, it takes a while to hear from Representation.\u201d\n\u201cOh, he did. His exact words were something like, \u2018You can wait your full five years like everybody else, you impatient brat. If you want to steal one of the only decent people in my life, I\u2019m gonna make you live the same bureaucracy that\u2019s been ruining mine for the last thirty.\u2019 There was a lot of spittle.\u201d\n\u201cSteal? Wait, Cameron, did you already ask about me?\u201d\n\u201cYes. He didn\u2019t like \u2018by the time they get back to me, she might be fucking dead\u2019 either!\u201d The young woman was animated, throwing her hands through the air. This was the Cameron that Robin remembered. The familiarity was welcome. Not everything about Cameron needed to change. At least, not immediately.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a morbid take on my life expectancy.\u201d\n\u201cI was bargaining.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s rude to use your friends as chips.\u201d\n\u201cSo we\u2019re friends again?\u201d\nRobin gave a sorrowful smile.\n\u201cYes, Cam, we are.\u201d\n\u201cThen come with me.\u201d\nRobin paused again, considering what it\u2019d be like to spend a couple of years alone with her young friend, recounting the precious decade of Earth-time that Robin had over Cameron. Stories of community. Age. Growth. She tried to picture what Cam would do with it, back on this new Earth she\u2019d heard many conflicting opinions on. Did she really want to die here? What was left, no longer waiting for the arrival of a connection to her rashly discarded past?\n\u201cGive me time for goodbyes.\u201d\n\u201cIf you say goodbyes, that asshole will hear about it. Also, he\u2019s gonna notice I stole his authcard pretty soon.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t think about it. I know not thinking is how we both landed here in the first place, but the flip side is no miracle cure either. You can sit here in indecision until you end up like \u2018Archie,\u2019 or you can come with. You\u2019ve still got time, if you hurry.\u201d\nRobin couldn\u2019t feel confident that life on Earth would be better, but . . . she\u2019d excised so much of herself from the world by leaving. She could let the rest of it dissipate into the vacuum out here, or she could reattach her cable to whatever was left.\n\u201cIf I do this . . . you can\u2019t leave again. Promise me that we\u2019ll stick it out. Together.\u201d\n\u201cFine. Yes. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d Robin replied, with gravity. \u201cPromise.\u201d\n\u201cI promise you, Robin Walker, that I\u2019m not running again. I\u2019ve seen how much running sucks, and . . . you\u2019re proof that at least sometimes, shit gets sorted out. I want to do this. You want to do this, I know it. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d\nCameron looked at her with characteristic ferocity. Gone was the resigned melancholy the young woman walked onto the station with. Robin felt glad. You only grew if you failed. You only failed if you tried. Damn, she thought.\nRobin nodded and stood. The alarm blared.\n\u201cShit,\u201d Cameron spat, and took off for the hallway.\n\u201cCameron, I\u2019m not twenty-seven, I can\u2019t run like this!\u201d Robin called to the woman as she ran down the hallway, stumbling, then bracing herself against the wall and panting. Cameron spun back around, wild-eyed.\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotta beat him to the docks! If we can get on my ship with the authcard before he reaches it, he can\u2019t stop us! Then we can rest!\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019not a question of desires! I can\u2019t run,\u201d Robin shouted between pants.\nCameron sighed, gears spinning in her brain.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll go. I\u2019ll meet you.\u201d\n\u201cMeet me?!\u201d Robin cried with confusion, but Cameron was already running again.\n\u201cGet a hab-suit on! Airlock 6! I swear, this is the only time I break my promise!\u201d\nRobin smiled. She wasn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to believe that was true, but by the proclamation alone, she knew Cameron was trying. That was enough. She gritted her teeth and made for an emergency locker.\nCameron punched the card just as the lieutenant stumbled onto the docking platform. She could see him screaming but couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying. She didn\u2019t much care. She hefted a nearby wrench and smashed the control panel, then ran for the ramp of her ship, careening into the cargo hold. Home sweet home. She jammed the button labeled \u201cSEAL\u201d and the ramp closed with a whoosh just as the sour old man ambled into view. She might regret how she treated him, someday. She hoped he\u2019d regret how he\u2019d treated her. She realized with grim reflection that she wouldn\u2019t be around to find out. The last time, she promised herself again.\nShe sat, hands working the controls automatically. Engines ignited, and she lifted off the surface before he could re-enable the docking clamps. As the ship rose and spun, she looked over the hab-dome from the exterior and realized she\u2019d miss the canopy of trees. Robin would probably miss it more. Oh well. There were plenty more beeches and maples where they were going. She sped away from the platform and angled the joysticks to drift toward Airlock 6. She could see Robin floating, attached by a cord to the station, waiting for Cameron to sweep her into the ship\u2019s airlock in a ridiculous but possible stunt. Multitasking, she gestured over to the nav-menu to queue the route for their jump\u2014she\u2019d spent all week perfecting it.\nOnly then did the freedom beneath Cameron\u2019s fingertips occur to her. She looked rimward through the viewport. Nothing could stop her. It was still out there, waiting. Quiet, black, and endless. She could leave Robin behind, cut the last cord\u2014accomplish what she\u2019d come here for in the first place.\nNo, she couldn\u2019t. Not really. She had known that when she touched down on Orion. She was still tethered. Always would be. There were threads wound through her, shaped like memory, and time tugged mercilessly on them wherever she went. Clocks only go one way. She wouldn\u2019t get anywhere continuing to fight them. She turned back to face Robin. The airlock stood open. The ship sailed closer, and Robin disappeared into it. She watched the now-detached cable drift rimward, like a fishing line into a sea of pitch. Cameron selected the route. Stood. Pressed. Confirmed. The world outside blurred. It was like she could feel the temporal shift. Watch the timelines stretch into winding rivers. She envisioned the delta where they all met, relentless and nurturing, a gathering of currents running away in every direction but meeting here, in this ship. She turned toward the cargo bay and its contents and left.\nJess Levine is an author, musician, kindergarten teacher, and communist organizer.

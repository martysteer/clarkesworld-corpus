That was, like, Reason #3 for most of our breakups, and we both know I never got around to working on it, because, well, path of least resistance, right? Why bother changing when it\u2019s slim pickings out here\u2014Drasti Prime, the whole damned Partnership frontier\u2014so I can just wait until you\u2019ve cooled off instead?\nYeah, so I could go on about how much of a winner I\u2019ve been, but you remember that time you airlocked me for Reason #2? I knew I\u2019d screwed up. Like, existential, is-this-just-who-I-am screwed up. So after I saw your shuttle off, I took a skiff out just to be alone for a while. Not the brightest idea, maybe, leaving the protective barrier while our allotment\u2019s still so unevenly explored, and mining ops aren\u2019t even up and running yet, and we\u2019ve got a casualty rate that\u2019s been, stars, like something back on Doro, eh, Silv? Except without all the cold.\nAnyway, I just needed a breather, Silv. Not as much as you did, clearly, flying off to study ancient tech around the sun, but still. One afternoon out couldn\u2019t hurt, right?\nExcept that at some point I must\u2019ve gone down the wrong stream on this plateau of ours. I knew enough not to veer hard right from our front gate, or I\u2019d reach that oblong canyon beside our allotment, and come tumbling down a waterfall into the Spinners\u2019 feeding grounds. I know, I know, they don\u2019t think of us as food, but we\u2019re still not much larger than what they do eat down there, and you know how crazy they get at feeding time. No point taking the risk.\nI wasn\u2019t paying much attention otherwise, though, because suddenly the water stopped being water, and all the chittering and whirring of insect life around me fell away, and then there was this . . . this terrible groaning and rubbery shifting of what turned out to be a field of fast-growing fungal fronds. Scared the hell out of me, the idea that I\u2019d landed in a new kind of Drastian trap, until I saw some of the spores twine together, trying to emulate my form.\nOkay, no, fine, I admit it: that scared me, too.\nBut then this spore-form started babbling at me in clipped phrases, not Partnership Standard but not entirely unfamiliar. A bit like Saludon, actually, which made me think that maybe this thing had met our other neighbors first. And so we talked for, like, six minutes, me and this giant fungus with the liquid-dexterity of a slime, just confirming that we were both sentient through the usual: you know, mathematical proofs, local astronomical knowledge, and a couple melodies that just came to mind for the hell of it.\nSo far so good, eh?\nBut then it asked me if I was alone. Okay, no\u2014\u201casked\u201d is the wrong way of putting it. Suddenly it grew a dozen more spore-forms like me, all packed together, all happily chattering, and then it exploded the rest to leave the first Leni-look-alike slack-jawed and small, exhaling something like the Saludon word for empty?\u2014and . . . I dunno, Silv, I guess I got a bit dramatic.\nAll right, Silv, I cried.\nAnd not like those big cries I used to do to make you feel sorry for me and take me back\u2014I mean, how in the stars would that help me here? Nah, I cried more like it had just hit me that you had left Drasti Prime, that you were off to do more analysis on those massive mechanized mysteries from millennia past, and that I wouldn\u2019t just be able to come up to your door and talk to you until you felt so tired of listening to me outside you\u2019d give up and let me in. This time, Silv, I\u2019d actually have to wait to hear you again. Or to see that sliver of a smile you sometimes can\u2019t help but have, even when you\u2019re clean worn out by my nonsense.\nStars, I\u2019d give anything just to see that sliver right now again, too.\nBut, I mean, bad timing for the grief to hit me, right? That\u2019s what I realized, at least, when the remaining spore-form reached out to touch me, then mimicked my shuddering shoulders and my head buried in my hands.\nOof, and the sounds it made, Silv, trying to emulate my voice . . .\nSo I had to stop crying right away. I had to. Plus, then I had to explain why I\u2019d been crying, because I couldn\u2019t just let it go on thinking that this was what humans did all the time. Imagine, though, trying to explain a romantic tiff to a lifeform that\u2019s just one big network of fungal blooms with maybe a thousand different interacting sexes, when you\u2019ve only just met it.\nI mean, you\u2019d think it would have the lock on being weird, right? But the way its fronds kept growing and reacting to my ridiculous statements, the way it kept touching me like it was trying to process my emotions by taste or through something deeper, you could tell it was utterly baffled about human love. Like, there\u2019s a sentient being you just know went back to its point of origin after our conversation and flung out spores on its home soil to communicate to the rest of itself just how messed up the new neighbors are.\nCome to think of it, I\u2019m guessing the Feru didn\u2019t order an immediate counterstrike on our colony only out of . . . pity? Because oh, for sure, that species has the power to wipe us out, Silv, with or without clearance from the Spinners. And I sure as hell made for an annoying first example of the crap it might be in for if it didn\u2019t do a little pest control nice and early.\nI bet you\u2019re even thinking right now, \u201cAh, so that\u2019s why the Feru always act like we\u2019re one big joke. And here I thought they were just a naturally arrogant species.\u201d\nNah, Silv, I\u2019m sure they were a pretty humble bunch until I came along. Then they used me as a baseline for all of humanity\u2014and by extension, the Partnership, because what kind of intergalactic compact lets the likes of me wear a uniform, right?\u2014and the rest is history.\nI bet you\u2019re wondering now, too, what I told it about you. Yeah, that\u2019s fair. You know how breakups go. We either go around twisting the facts to make ourselves seem more like the perfect victims, or go overboard insisting that we totally understand why someone else couldn\u2019t stand to be with us anymore, until that makes us look pathetic and pitiable\u2014which, if you squint hard enough, is . . . kinda like being a victim, too?\nOh, and sure, there\u2019s always Keegler as a counterpoint, I know, but I\u2019m still putting chits on him being a sociopath. No one can be that cheerful about every break-up, always going on about how blessed he was to get even a little time in the cosmos with someone he loves.\nSociopath, Silv. Either that, or he\u2019s tripping on some special breed of Chigger.\nNo, seriously\u2014that\u2019s the only other possibility I can figure. Maybe one of those invasive nanobots here carries the blueprints for, like, a psychedelic beetle, and Keegler slips out from the construction site to get bitten by it, then comes back to the main compound for regeneration only after his DNA\u2019s been rewritten enough that he can lick, say, an exoskeletal forearm, and get a decent high. Maybe that\u2019s where he gets his bizarrely euphoric calm.\nStars, we\u2019ve both seen way weirder since we set up camp here, Silv, and you know it.\nBut yeah, either way . . . I guess I told the Feru that I thought you expected too much of me, and that I just couldn\u2019t change as fast you wanted me to. Like, if there was a Chigger for that kind of miracle, let me have at it, right? Then, after that stellar start to things with the Feru, I went into this long, rambling story of why I figured I was the way I was, and how much of a disappointment I was always going to be, and how maybe the whole colony would be better off if I just dropped dead right then and there and became food for the Feru\u2019s fronds instead.\nOh\u2014but don\u2019t worry, Silv. You should\u2019ve seen how its fronds recoiled at that last.\nApparently, even a giant sentient fungus that\u2019s sprawled every which way to inhabit all the land and waterways in its territory can still have a decent sense of taste.\nAnd apparently my own body\u2014yeah, real shocker there\u2014just wasn\u2019t up to snuff.\n2\nHey Silv\u2014\nSorry, that last audfile cut off kinda abruptly. Yeah, see, I wasn\u2019t even sure I should be sending you these recordings, not when you\u2019re still in that damned bio-chamber, recovering. I kept going back and forth, like: Should I wait until you wake up to tell you all this in person? Or would that be even more exhausting? Maybe it\u2019d just send you back into a coma?\nAnd then I realized that I was just scared, maybe too scared to finish what I\u2019d started, so I told myself, go on, Leni, send out at least the first audfile. Then you\u2019ll have to record the rest. Reason #1, am I right? Everything I do, even the good stuff, I do out of fear most of all.\nBut enough with the self-pity\u2014I was telling you about my public breakdown, when the Feru had only just met me, and humanity, and the whole Partnership, too. Stars, I think I heard once of an officer making first contact while they were disposing of ship\u2019s waste, just chucking biohazardous material right onto the new species\u2019 heads by accident\u2014but I bet even that officer had the presence of mind not to start dumping out all his emotional garbage, too!\nLuckily, though, the Feru at least had the presence of spore-colony mind to call for local assistance when it realized how weirdly bent out of shape I was. So then a Spinner showed up, freakily tic-tic-tic-tic-ing its massive spidey legs as it conversed with the Feru before taking me home, and that\u2019s when it first really clicked for me: Stars above, those crazy sentient fronds weren\u2019t just another part of this planet\u2019s natural ecosystem. They were aliens, too! They had their own Spinners, for stars\u2019 sake, wandering about in another version of those creepy Uranian-blue masks over those giant mounds of gleaming red eyes.\n(I mean\u2014as if any of those masks could ever really cover the horror of arachnoid biocomputers, eh, Silv? And the breath on those big buggers, too!)\nSo when I got back, I asked one of our own Spinners for more intel about these other colonists, and that\u2019s when I learned that our freaky-big bio-servants, on behalf of their absent planetary masters, had given permission for four colonies, total, all around the massive canyon at the limits of our territory. And yeah, sure, that\u2019s common knowledge now, but can you believe that just half a standard ago, the Partnership only knew about the Saludons? I mean, it\u2019s not like we\u2019d ever asked if there were any others, but then again, why would we? We\u2019d just assumed we knew what a colonizing force looked like, because the Saludons more or less travel the galaxy like we do\u2014so if nothing else was showing up on Drasti Prime that acted like the Partnership or Saludons, probably nothing else was colonizing the same joint, right?\nStars, it\u2019s crazy how some things just become the new norm\u2014almost overnight it feels like\u2014and how quickly we forget what life was like before them.\nBut also, to be fair, the Saludons did take up a lot of our time and attention. How could they not, when they descended in those massive military vessels to start mining their desert allotment for the same microbial engine straight away? You just can\u2019t be too careful when a potential enemy pops up in the neighborhood belting \u201cUNITY OF STRENGTH\u201d on all channels and shared languages. Even with those unallotted honeycomb caves between us and those obnoxious squadrons of conquered soldiers from other intergalactic compacts, you know as well as me that the Saludons are always just a bit too close for comfort.\nThe Feru, though . . . Well, they were something new, weren\u2019t they? Something it had never occurred to us to think of as meaningfully sentient when we set down here last year. So that was kinda cool, I guess: getting to file a report that would change the way the Partnership thought about, oh, all the possibilities for intergalactic travel, and different frameworks for sentience, and other sorts of cross-species networking across the known universe.\nNot too shabby for an afternoon\u2019s walkabout, eh?\n(And also, I guess . . . thank you, Silv? I mean, if you hadn\u2019t been so furious with me for my stupid life choices and packed up early to start work on your solar-mech research, someone else might\u2019ve taken that skiff the wrong way \u2019round outside the compound, and run into the Feru first. Ugh. Okay, and now I\u2019m just imagining Keegler being the one to do it, and all the \u201cblessings\u201d he\u2019d have crammed into his report after, about being the first to meet our fungal friends on Drasti Prime. Thanks on behalf of all of us, then, Silv, for a Partnership record that won\u2019t make future historians want to pluck their eyes from their eyestems!)\nAlso, listen . . . You were already off-planet by then, so don\u2019t be surprised that this is the first you\u2019re hearing about my involvement. It\u2019s really been forgotten everywhere, because I downplayed the hell out of my interaction on that initial report, once I had sense enough to realize how much I\u2019d mucked our first contact up. And yeah, okay, maybe that\u2019s bending the whole Partnership-playbook a bit, but at the time I figured, hey, better for HQ just to know that the Feru existed, and to send someone else to make what they\u2019d all assume was the first real conversation between humanity and a sentient fungus. Maybe no one would be the wiser. Maybe it\u2019d all work out in the end without any need for further embarrassment.\nAnd . . . it did work out, more or less. Upper-orbit sent a crack team of diplomats, the Partnership formally met with the Feru, and later that month the Partnership encountered other weirdo colony, the nebulous Esh\u2014all while continuing to keep a super healthy distance from the Saludons. Then you came back, a couple months after the whole revelation, and we made up . . . and broke up . . . and made up again, just before you headed out for another crack at ancient mysteries around the sun. Happily ever after, more or less, here on Drasti Prime.\nExcept for one little detail, Silv.\nAn accident, let\u2019s call it.\nBecause, remember: The Feru didn\u2019t know any better either. For it this was first contact with something bipedal and meaty, like most of the Saludons, but otherwise ridiculously different than anything it had seen before. Was I Saludon, too? Not really. Not enough self-discipline. A malfunctioning Saludon, maybe? That might explain why it tried broken Saludon with me at first\u2014maybe my damage extended to my language, too?\nBut mostly I think it treated me like a confused spore, far-flung from its colony, so it was doing what it would have done with any foreign spore-form while trying to assess if it should be neighborly or not. It started crafting new protein chains on a cellular level, trying to communicate by replicating all my movements and constituent parts. And it wasn\u2019t just on the macro level that it was making these changes, like with that crazy spore-form spectacle of a dozen new Leni-look-alikes exploding all around the first. It was on the microscopic, too. The Feru spore-form \u201ctasted\u201d me, if that\u2019s the right word for it. And replicated. And emulated. And waited for my responses before \u201ctasting\u201d and replicating anew.\nAnd, stars, Silv, even just in that brief interaction, did it ever figure me out well.\nBecause after a few months, just as I\u2019d let myself believe that my mess of a first contact scenario had been forgotten\u2014not only by the Partnership but by the Feru, too\u2014apparently the Feru had given up on trying to reintegrate this one, baffling episode with the rest of itself. And how do I know that? Well . . . because a couple weeks after you were sent back in cryo, to finish your treatment in the bigger bio-chambers here, it was the damnedest thing, Silv.\nI thought I\u2019d become, like . . . a parent?\nOr gained a clone?\nI mean, something that looked like me showed up outside the compound walls: fungal for sure, but also completely cut off from the rest of the Feru. What would you have called it?\nOh, and as if that wasn\u2019t freaky enough, listen\u2014I\u2019ve got the recording right here with me. This is what it called out when it showed up, just pounding on the Partnership\u2019s front gate:\nHooooooome!\nHooooooome!\nHooooooome!\n3\nYeah, Silv\u2014crazy, right?\nYou know, I\u2019m picturing you laughing as you listen to these audfiles once you wake up. And I\u2019ll have deserved your laughter, too\u2014because this has gotta be one of the worst first contacts ever. First I burst into tears with a giant alien, then I whine about my failed relationship and messed-up childhood on a far-flung world, then I accept its baffled attempts at interspecies reassurance, and finally, months later, I wake up to this me-sized baby dumped at my front door. I mean, an all-out war after botched first contact\u2019s gotta be easier to explain, right? This . . . this was just uncomfortable.\nAnd you have no idea how much side-eye I got here for it, too.\nI mean, at first it was just Zeph staring at the front gate surveillance footage, then staring back at me, then staring at the monitor again. Then he laughed and said, \u201cStars, Leni! I know it\u2019s been rough since Silv left, but are you going strange on us?\u201d\nThen Manoush got in on it too, telling Zeph, \u201cNo, chasing strange. Big difference.\u201d\nWhich, I mean . . . with friends like these, you know? So I told them, \u201cMates, it\u2019s not me, and I didn\u2019t consent to whatever that is out there looking like me.\u201d\nBut all Zeph did was shrug and say, \u201cWell, we don\u2019t know much about it yet, but the Feru does seem to like its jokes.\u201d\nAnd, yeah, fair enough. I probably made it that way when it came to us humans: the biggest jokes of all, from the Feru\u2019s point of view.\nStill . . . this didn\u2019t feel like a joke, Silv. That spore-form, it really sounded like it was in pain. Or in trouble. But when I asked about letting it in, Manoush got super serious with me. Which, after all, is his job\u2014protector of the compound, and so forth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard neg on entry,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know this species well, and we can\u2019t limit its propagation. Plus, it\u2019s not like we can just call the Feru up to see what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the damned downside of meeting a species that never needed tech to expand\u2014no easy comms system. So, I guess we need to send someone out to see what it wants.\u201d\n\u201cSomeone.\u201d Right. But you just know who everyone was thinking of, eh, Silv?\nI even tried to tell them, I said, \u201cMates, this is like a shitty B-plot vidfile. Come on now\u2014think: You send me out and maybe that thing takes my identity. You\u2019ll have no idea who you\u2019re letting back in.\u201d\nBut they just looked at each other, grinning.\n\u201cWho says we were gonna let you back in at all?\u201d said Zeph.\n\u201cTwo slingshot maneuvers with one course-correction,\u201d Manoush added. \u201cWin-win!\u201d\nAnd yeah, Silv, I see what you mean now about sticking with friends who choose to mock your openness when something\u2019s really got you down. About how who we surround ourselves with shapes the forms we take on. Okay, sure, it\u2019s slim pickings out here, too\u2014but it was the same back on Doro, wasn\u2019t it? So where\u2019s the real agency in any of this? When do we get to choose\u2014I mean, really choose\u2014whose behaviors we\u2019re going to learn from as we grow?\nSuper easy to get philosophical when you\u2019re just talking into an unresponsive comm-screen, though. In that moment, though, in that control room . . . I was stuck, you know? I was stuck with what I\u2019d built up for myself to that point in my life. And hey, Silv, for the record, they\u2019re not a bad crew, overall: Mani, Zeph, and me . . . I\u2019d say we\u2019ve held each other up at least as much as we\u2019ve pushed each other down. Only, that day, it was more of the pushing-down than the building-up, and I was shaking, Silv. I was scared. I mean, I think anyone would be, if a mushroom-double just showed up moaning outside the front gate, banging to be let in, but it really had me thinking pretty dire thoughts. Like, this is it, Leni\u2014this is gonna be the end of you. If you go out there and meet that thing, you\u2019re done for. You\u2019re facing a void where your future was supposed to be.\n. . . Oh, and stars, Silv: I just realized\u2014I never left you an audfile before heading out.\nWhat if something really had happened to me, and I\u2019d never even gotten a chance to . . . ?\nWow.\nWow, yeah, what a winner I\u2019ve been.\nSo, okay, who knows: maybe a clone version of me wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been so bad after all.\nEven one that smells a bit mulchier than I usually do.\n4\nHey Silv\u2014\nIf you\u2019re wondering about the gap in time stamps, I had to finish some admin tasks before I went on. Counting down the hours left here, I suppose. Had a good wander around the colony, too\u2014saw the sunrise and its incineration plumes in the upper atmosphere. Listened to some of the local wildlife through the monitors, nice and safe from Chigger bites, and helped the last construction crew debark and sanitize. Apparently, we\u2019ve cut down burn-rates from long-term exposure to the microbial engine, too, so hey\u2014there\u2019s a plus for you, eh?\nStars, it\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019ve been in that bio-chamber for so long. I can go see you whenever I like, but I haven\u2019t, you know. I can\u2019t even lie about that now: it\u2019s not a pretty sight, your skin still recovering from that power surge, and I guess I\u2019d just rather remember you as I last saw you, about to take off: full of righteous fury and a pretty solid work ethic, too.\nDid you know the Partnership\u2019s considering sending down a counselor to help with trauma recovery here on Drasti Prime? I mean, I kinda think it\u2019s a great idea, what with all the casualties we\u2019ve been taking trying to get the construction site up and running. Those Saludons just cracked the whole mining thing, didn\u2019t they? Meanwhile the Esh and Feru are naturally suited to seeping through the slightest terran openings, so they\u2019ve been having good hunting, too. But here we sluggish humans are, still fighting Chiggers and other natural disasters just to keep the Saludons from laying too much of a claim on this vast world with so many mysteries to it. And I mean, that\u2019s crazy, too, isn\u2019t it? How with the Spinners and the Chiggers and that bewildering solar mech, there\u2019s so much about this place we don\u2019t know yet. So much about its ancient rulers we can\u2019t access\u2014and which\u2019ll probably take ever so much longer to figure out, just because we\u2019re all trying to learn what we can about them on our own.\nA counselor, though\u2014whew!\nYou ask me, Silv, that\u2019s being mighty confident that a lot of our mates\u2019ll even talk to another officer in a professional capacity about what\u2019s eating us\u2014even if, stars above, some of us really need it. You know, a few months back, one of the perimeter guards got to drinking and told us that he actually liked to go outside the barrier and get bitten, just to see what would happen, what he might turn into next. Damned foolish thing to do, we told him. What if he got bitten somewhere vital, and turned too quickly? Plus, didn\u2019t he have any respect for the impact on the rest of us, while he was off regenerating in medbay? The colony\u2019s still too small and fragile for any of us to spend most of our time healing.\nBut he shrugged it all off, Silv. All our complaints, all our fears, all our reprimands. Told us that maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, wandering off and becoming one of those lizards or insects instead. That maybe that was the real reason the Partnership had been drawn to this world in the first place: like, a cosmic calling. Like maybe the endgame for all of us here was to change, to be reborn, and to transform into something incredible and new.\nHis words were generic spiritualist pap, of course, but that shrug stayed with me, Silv. Waiting, deep inside, for the right moment to strike. And I guess that moment, for me, was when I first saw that giant fungus on the monitor, just . . . crying out in so much pain from a body so much like mine. My memory of that guard\u2019s shrug, his complete indifference to fear of transformation, shot up inside me like some of those fast-growing fronds on Feruvian territory, and then I took that mental image with me, when I went to meet my look-alike outside.\nFG, I\u2019ve started calling him.\nGet it? A \u201cFun Guy\u201d\u2014just like me!\nAh, it\u2019ll grow on you, Silv.\nThat thing sure did on me.\n5\nHey Silv\u2014\nYou remember when we were serving on the River of Courage together, both of us taking positions there to escape shitty childhoods on Doro mid-freeze, and you used to make all these references to parts of The Sunmaster\u2019s Journey that I probably learned as a kid in the eastern colony, but definitely did my best to binge drink away?\nIt took me so long to realize that you weren\u2019t just trying to show me up. Reason #2, right? That defensiveness. How I treated everything like a competition and everything you did, even more so. Like that time you wrote a poem for the annual Partnership call for membership modifications to The Sunmaster\u2019s Journey, and I went around for weeks after you got an honorable mention, just telling everyone bored enough to listen about how I\u2019d been planning a full rewrite of the text myself.\nOh, I know, Silv. I know. If you\u2019d actually wanted to be in a threesome, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have picked a better third than my damned ego.\nI think I get it now, though: why you love the Partnership\u2019s core text so much, and why the Partnership loves it, too. Because it really is a decent template, isn\u2019t it, for teaching the culture behind our language, the sort of partnership to which all of our intergalactic relations supposedly aspire. Either way, \u201cteaching the culture\u201d is exactly what I ended up doing to find common ground with good old FG. Teaching it our ways, our hopes, our words.\nEmphasis on \u201ctrying,\u201d though, because for the first couple sols the most that FG would say was a howling, anguished Home! Home! Home!, and when I tried to get more out of it, FG just repeated bits back to me, or reverted to Saludon. So I wasn\u2019t sure what to do here, really\u2014take it back to the Feru? Report it to the Spinners and see if they had any ideas?\nAt least, being around FG in the wilds of Drasti Prime, I got a little bit of the Feru\u2019s immunity against the Chiggers, which definitely can\u2019t handle the spore dust as well as it can our suits, slipping even through our masks with the visors down to insert those nano-protocols. As long as I stayed in FG\u2019s sphere of protection, then, I knew I didn\u2019t have to worry about turning into a giant lizard or beetle or crustacean. But for how long, I wondered. What did FG want? Why did it even exist? Was it one last little Feruvian joke, crafted just to get at me?\nI hadn\u2019t the slightest idea, Silv, which is why I thought so much of you, when you were trying to bridge the gaps between us with the right tale or two. Those first sols off-compound, I told FG anything that popped into my head, but nothing about me\u2014because, stars, Silv! Of course I knew better than to make it easier for it to steal my body in my sleep.\nSo, I told it Sunmaster stories instead.\nYour versions, to be precise, since I couldn\u2019t remember most from my own readings. Mostly, I just remembered you referencing a line or a story beat as it suited the occasion between us, and I tried to spin together the whole of each tale for FG from those fragments.\nLike, do you remember the one where . . . I mean, of course you do, you remember everything, but humor me here . . . Do you remember the one where the Sunmaster kept trying to escape itself in a long series of disconnected lives? Like, first it was doing recon work on a scout ship not far from Europa, then served as a line cook on a waystation, then lived as a cartel enforcer dumping criminal evidence into the sun, and at some point even as a snail\u2014a rare snail, found only in the gardens of Morau Prison, out on an outpost circling the Restuvian Black Hole, where its only task was to nibble at the prison garden\u2019s toxic leaves?\nThat\u2019s the story FG liked the most, as far as I could tell\u2014the story of a being who kept waking up in different forms and destinies, which I guess makes sense, the Feru being what it is\u2014so I kept telling that story, and making up more lives for the Sunmaster to go through until it discovered why no number of disparate lives could bring it closer to true mastery over it all.\nAnd as my look-alike listened to my increasingly tenuous version of this story, FG started to get more adventurous. First it stopped whimpering all the time, which was a great start, and then it started saying different words\u2014words in Partner that I couldn\u2019t fully understand, but were still a welcome change from all the tedious Home! Home! Home! business. Even a mysterious run of Seedpod! Flightshell! Spaceshelter! was a step in the right direction.\nAll that time, though, I was also thinking: Stars, Silv should be here telling this story.\nBecause you always did tell the best stories. You know that, right?\nOr at least, you told the same story over and over, no matter how many times I\u2019d come along to knock it all down, and you\u2019d try to make it that story the best it could be.\nThe story of us, Silv\u2014as if we\u2019d somehow done the impossible, the thing that even the Sunmaster couldn\u2019t do. As if we\u2019d cycled through all the shitty versions of ourselves, and at last arrived at the right version, so that now, finally!, our perfect life together could really begi\u2014\n6\nOh, shit, Silv\u2014\nSorry, that last audfile cut off before I was finished. Pressed the wrong button, I think, but\u2014hah. Probably for the best. I was getting into one of my moods there, wasn\u2019t I?\nLook, the point is, I told FG our Sunmaster stories while hanging out with it beyond the protective barrier\u2014and it didn\u2019t eat me; and I didn\u2019t turn into a crustacean. Hell, I didn\u2019t even get adopted by the Spinners and taken to the secret caves where they spin all their solutions to the toughest problems we give them to resolve\u2014much as I\u2019d still super like to have seen those deeper Drasti Prime structures while I could!\n(Stars, and maybe we should\u2019ve asked them to spin on us, too, eh Silv? I wonder if there\u2019d\u2019ve been enough cave space for all of the calculations that little problem would\u2019ve involved!)\nBut like I was saying, in the middle of telling FG some of the Partnership\u2019s core stories to build a common vocabulary, FG got a little too excited, and after a few of those failed bursts in Standard Partner, it tried to get through to me in a way that made more sense to its species. And stars, Silv\u2014are those fungal forms ever strong! No wonder Chiggers don\u2019t stand a chance of seeding them with all their rogue DNA.\nSo there I was, right in the middle of one of your stories I\u2019d actually forgotten the middle to, when FG wrapped some of its fronds around my arm (so tight that I thought for a moment it was just going to seep into my vascular system and take me over from the inside out), and then it hauled us off toward the Feru. Which, fair enough, okay: maybe it was ready to go home, like it had been saying all this time?\nExcept that it didn\u2019t even pause as it entered Feru territory, not even when other fronds rose up in friendly greeting\u2014although they didn\u2019t do so for long, if you can believe it. Yeah, no: apparently the sight of a lone human shouting and kicking as a look-alike spore-form marches them both along the marsh doesn\u2019t warrant the Feru\u2019s further attention? Stars, Silv, I know I\u2019ve done the whole manipulative silent-treatment thing myself from time to time, but now I know it definitely feels shitty on the receiving end. When, like, a whole damned field of gold-green frond-stalks chooses to rustle indifferently in the breeze instead of paying you any mind while you\u2019re out there just . . . just screaming for aid. It\u2019s the worst.\nOh, and get this\u2014even the local Spinners, four large clumps of dark furry legs with those damned blue masks over their beady red eyes and salivating mandibles, took their cues from the Feru\u2019s indifference, so they just stood in silence, barely moving about, except to emulate the faint swaying of the Feru, while my mimic hauled me along.\nIf FG had decided to absorb me right then and there, would any of them have so much as flinched at my death cry?\n. . . Probably not.\nSo, ah, yeah\u2014best not to dwell on that part right now.\nEventually, though, FG and I ended up on the far side of the Feru territory\u2014which, as you know, meant we were about to engage with the Esh. Crazy things, all those scattered, sentient nebulae: like giant floating jellyfish, if each jellyfish contained a brewing electrical storm under its gelatinous cap. But the Esh weren\u2019t alone, either\u2014if ever an Esh could be called \u201calone,\u201d even in their more dispersed states. Rather, one of the bigger Esh-clouds was busy conversing with a Saludon squadron, which left me feeling like FG and I were crashing one of those parties where no one wants to be the one to point out that, technically, nobody invited you, but everyone still looks at you like you should just know you don\u2019t belong.\nWe were all there, actually: the Esh, the Saludons, the Feru (well, its cast-off), and me, Leni\u2014just this mess of a Partnership officer who\u2019d no business being involved in any major interspecies negotiations (if that was, in fact, what was going down in Esh-land at the time).\nTo top it all off, too, that\u2019s when Manoush\u2019s face popped up on the viewscreen looming over my right-arm console, asking me to explain why I was late with my quarter-sol check-in.\n\u201cAh, sorry, Mani, I, uh, got caught up in something.\u201d\nLiterally caught up in something\u2014FG\u2019s tendrils\u2014and then carried away.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that I\u2019m hearing, Leni? What\u2019ve you got going on around you?\u201d\n\u201cAn interspecies jamboree,\u201d I said, more or less truthfully.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just picking card games right now,\u201d I added, more or less untruthfully.\nBut Manoush wasn\u2019t in the playful mood I\u2019d expected, considering how he and Zeph had treated me before sending me out, four-and-a-half sols back. \u201cLeni, listen carefully,\u201d he said. \u201cI need you to quit messing around, get that thing with you to tell us what it wants, and get the hell back here. I don\u2019t have time for this shit\u2014none of us do, back on base.\u201d\nAnd, well, that was an unexpected tone from Manoush, but you know how it goes with the gang, Silv: we\u2019re all fun and jokes until something really serious goes down, and then we snap at each other like we\u2019ve never cracked a joke before in our lives, we don\u2019t even know what a joke is, and most of all, how dare anyone else not already have their full attention fixed on this crazy new problem that\u2019s just shown up in our lives?\nSo my heart was in my boots, Silv, because when Manoush gets like this, things are bad back on the compound. Like, really bad.\n\u201cLoud and clear, Mani,\u201d I said. \u201cBut why, what\u2019s the damage? Don\u2019t hold out on me.\u201d\nAnd Manoush worked his jaw before grinding out, \u201cWe\u2019ve got casualties, Len. Another microbial plume surged along the latest the rigging. Multiple casualties just this morning.\u201d\n\u201cCasualties? Mani, are you talking injuries or, like\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMostly burns, but bad ones. Zeph\u2019s in a bio-chamber.\u201d\n\u201cZeph\u2019s in a\u2014?!\u201d\n\u201cLook, that\u2019s all I know right now, Leni. So get back here, and fast.\u201d\n\u201cAffirmative.\u201d I felt my skin go cold to the touch\u2014and since FG was still wrapped around my other wrist, I\u2019m sure it could feel the same.\nBut then I was acutely aware of the Esh and that Saludon squadron staring at me, and realized they\u2019d heard every word, too.\n7\nAh, stars, Silv\u2014\nLook, I\u2019m trying to get all this out the right way, the way where I\u2019m honest and up-front about how shit makes me feel instead of going off on another wild tangent until I\u2019ve worn us both out, but sometimes it\u2019s not \u201cfeeling\u201d that\u2019s the matter, Silv.\nIt\u2019s . . . it\u2019s momentum, you know?\nLike, there I was in Esh territory, this spore-form locked onto my arm\u2014probably with the strength to take over my body on a whim if it wanted to\u2014while a lightning storm flashed before me in sentient bursts turned to thunderous proclamations (all in Saludon, by the way\u2014which didn\u2019t make things a bit easier), and a whole, stony-faced line of Saludon soldiers stood to the right, and I was still trying to process that Zeph was in danger\u2014Zeph was in a bio-chamber, for star\u2019s sake!\u2014and I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be back in time to tell him what an absolute blockhead he\u2019d been for getting banged up in the first place.\nOh, and speaking of that mining site, Silv: To hell with it. To hell with the whole damned project. You know how many we\u2019ve lost since it all started, while trying to access Drasti Prime\u2019s microbial engine without it bursting through in unpredictable ways. But why?\u2014that\u2019s the real question. Why even bother trying to stabilize a colony on a planet that\u2019s always trying to kill us or turn us into other species if we so much as step out of our zone?\nRight, right, I know: Because of the Saludons. Because the Partnership needs to stake this claim, even if it kills us, just so it doesn\u2019t automatically fall into the hands of a militia that assimilates whatever the hell it wants, when it wants it\u2014and otherwise bides its time, looking down on free species with something between pity and contempt, because we haven\u2019t proven worthy enough yet to engage it in battle, lose to it in battle, and be consumed by it in turn.\nThat moment out on Esh-land, Silv . . . while thinking about Zeph, and Partnership geopolitics, and oh, just the futility of it all, I just wanted to storm over and clock the Saludon squad leader. Lucky, I guess, that FG still had me fast by the arm\u2014but it was the Esh-cloud, really, that put me in my place. After both the Saludons and the Esh-cloud heard me talking to Manoush, the Esh-cloud switched to its freshly acquired Partnership Standard to boom at me, WHAT. WANT. TERRITORY. OURS. FLIMSY. FLESH.\nAnd I just . . .\nStars, Silv, I just laughed. I mean\u2014\u201cFlimsy flesh!\u201d\nI\u2019m not even kidding; that\u2019s exactly what the Esh said. Now there\u2019s one we could\u2019ve used on nights when I was just feeling a little too beat to perform, eh?\nAnd, oh, I was ready, Silv; I was going to give it a zinger of a retort for sure, but before I could answer, FG was trying out my voice again: its mushroom-flap of a mouth not quite matching its internal vocal patterns\u2014as if it hadn\u2019t quite connected how the human mouth related to speech\u2014but still managing to produce sounds that were close enough.\n\u201cNeed! Seedpod! Flightshell! Spaceshelter!\u201d it said, like a rubbery version of me.\nAnd blow me over a debris field, Silv, but that was the context I needed: A ship! FG wanted a ship!\nBut had it always been looking for a spaceship, or was this new? Had the stories I\u2019d been telling it these past few days given poor old FG a case of wanderlust?\nMaybe I\u2019d broken it twice. That sounds like me, doesn\u2019t it, Silv? First, I busted it at the moment of its conception, when it sprang into being as this . . . mess of emotional damage that couldn\u2019t reintegrate with its colony after first contact with me. Bad enough, right? But then I go on encouraging the little weirdo to run off even further from everything it comes from, out from family and community into the distant stars. But to go\u2014where, exactly? Where was Home?\nThe leader of the Saludon squadron had similar concerns. He flipped open his visor and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to that bit of Feru?\u201d Reading my damned mind, Silv: just one more reason I can\u2019t help but hate the whole, creepy lot of them.\n\u201cNothing!\u201d I said\u2014which clearly wasn\u2019t true.\n\u201cIt just showed up outside our colony\u2019s protective barrier, and I was sent to figure out what the hell it wanted.\u201d\u2014which, okay, sort of was.\nBut this last part confused the Saludon squad leader even more. \u201cWhy you? Did your leader want you to be replaced by a Feruvian replicant?\u201d\nAnd I laughed in spite of myself. \u201cHa ha\u2014yeah, that\u2019s what I said.\u201d (More or less.)\n\u201cMaybe they were trying to get rid of an inferior soldier,\u201d offered one of the other Saludons, pointing to me and then FG with his weapon. \u201cKind of a two-for-one.\u201d\nWhich, oof, is also what Manoush and Zeph had said, pretty much.\nDamn it, Zeph, I was also thinking at the time. You bio-chambered blockhead.\n\u201cYes, that scans,\u201d the squad leader agreed, before giving me a pitying once-over. \u201cDo you want us to eliminate the replicant, or do have you enough self-sufficiency for that task?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d I said, startled.\nAnd a pause descended on our ungainly grouping, before the second Saludon officer whispered to his leader, weapon raised: \u201cWas that . . . \u2018no\u2019 to the first part, or to the second?\u201d\n\u201cThe first!\u201d I snapped\u2014though hell if I knew why I was resisting the offer. FG was wrapped so damned tightly around my wrist that I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever get my arm back. But before I could explain, the Esh-cloud\u2014clearly annoyed by all the clutter and non-Eshian cacophony\u2014boomed at everyone: LEAVE!\nAnd then it didn\u2019t even wait for any of us to try to comply. With a furious plume of pent-up nebulous energy, the sentient storm blew me and FG\u2014hard\u2014out to the edge of its territory. In the direction, as it turned out, of the cliffs overlooking the centralized canyon.\nThe canyon in which the Spinners, mind you, come daily and horrifically to feed.\n8\nSo, Silv . . .\nI mean, obviously, I didn\u2019t get eaten. I\u2019m recording this, aren\u2019t I?\n(Not a fungal clone, ha ha! Although wouldn\u2019t that be nice?)\nAnd I promise, too, that I didn\u2019t do any lasting damage to our relationships with the Feru, the Esh, and the Saludons\u2014much as I\u2019d still really like to with that last!\nBut soon after getting tumbled by an Esh-cloud over the edge of that cliff, there I was with FG wrapped around my wrist\u2014FG, who had fluttered its fronds into a parachute as we descended\u2014sitting dazed on the canyon floor with maybe a hundred different local species crawling and whirring and resting and feeding all around me.\nIt\u2019s not a bad joint, Silv, that canyon, with its threads of ankle-high mist at the right times of the day, and its lush desert-styled vegetation . . . even if, okay, it is kinda weird that the Spinners chose not to allocate this property to any of us. Did our colonies really need a buffer to avoid a fight? Or did the Spinners just like having a core space from which to monitor us?\nBoundaries are useful, though, I suppose\u2014so if that is what this all is, I guess I should respect that. There\u2019s been talk on our side, even, of creating a firmer barrier between our land and that of the Feru\u2014and if that happens, crossing the canyon floor might eventually become the easiest point of travel between us. Way easier, I guess, than risking another idly paddling fool slipping from one territory to the next on a skiff, just to cause trouble for the neighbors.\nBut anyway, whatever its overall function in the grand, Drasti Prime scheme of things, for the moment, there I was, Silv\u2014taking in the beauty of the canyon floor and listening to the keening of my fungal look-alike; and thinking about Zeph; and thinking about FG\u2019s bewildering demand. A ship! Stars, Silv\u2014no way would the Partnership let this Feruvian cast-off enter the service solo: at least not with so much still to be hashed out where basic interspecies treaties were concerned. But what other options were there? The Esh had no need for space-travel in a hard-shelled vessel, while the Saludons were pretty much always on standby for an excuse to kill and capture\u2014definitely not in the business of ferrying tourists across the cosmos.\nOn alTspeaK forums, you know, tons of people seem to think that this solar-mech you\u2019ve been studying might\u2019ve helped with deep space travel. I know, I know, you\u2019ve got other ideas, but you can see why they\u2019re hoping for the transportation option, right? Because maybe cracking that mystery could take us to wherever the hell those ancient makers are hanging out now, and we could ask them to fix tons of our other problems, too. And besides, why not transportation? Where\u2019s the evidence against it? That tech definitely wasn\u2019t used to stabilize the sun\u2019s growth cycle, like you thought on one of your first tours out, before you hit that first massive wall with your research.\nI mean, no offense intended by that part, of course, Silv: You know how it goes, right? Sometimes the greatest triumphs we get in life come from eliminating nonviable possibilities. So I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a flaw or anything that your guess didn\u2019t work out, because . . .\nHuh.\nYeah, we don\u2019t ever talk much about your flaws, now do we, Silv?\nAnd I guess that makes sense, because if you ask me, they\u2019re only flaws in certain contexts. Like, as a researcher, you need that same perseverance. That ability to just keep at something even if it\u2019s difficult, even if it\u2019s hard, even if it\u2019s just . . . you know . . . really wearing you down, and it might never amount to anything we\u2019d call a success in the end. Even if you have a super-lousy setback, and that ancient solar-mech retaliates at your testing, and its blastwave knocks you so hard into a coma that you\u2019re still taking your sweet time coming out of it weeks later, while the rest of your second-degree burns get hugely patched up.\nWhat a scientist! they\u2019ll say when you wake up, Silv. What an admirably driven Partnership officer, giving her all to one of the greatest cosmic pursuits: The desire not just to know, but also to connect. To make new and startling links where none existed before.\nBut that isn\u2019t always the best trait elsewhere, is it, Silv?\nElsewhere like . . . in love . . . where it\u2019s more like pure gambler\u2019s fallacy: an addiction you can\u2019t quite shake because you never really want to. All this pouring out of more time and energy and feeling . . . oh, especially feeling . . . into a well that\u2019s sometimes just dry to the core, and will never ever give back the way you want it to.\nThe way most of us feel we deserve.\nAnd, stars, Silv, you do deserve it, you know. You deserve a real chance at\u2014I dunno where my metaphor\u2019s going here; you\u2019re the storyteller: Well-water? Love? Yeah, let\u2019s just call it love\u2014you deserve a real chance, Silv, at that thing with someone who doesn\u2019t get all hung up over what they\u2019re owed, and all the wounds that they desperately want acknowledged but definitely don\u2019t want fixed up, because . . . because they\u2019re too afraid that there\u2019s nothing under them. That if you take away all their wounds you take away what makes them them, too.\nBecause, yeah, I\u2019ve got my stories, and my reasons, Silv. We both know that much, at least\u2014but this isn\u2019t about either of those just now. This is about . . .\nOh, hell, Silv, it\u2019s . . . about the sound of that waterfall, cascading down whole sides of the Spinner\u2019s canyon in the right season, to converge in this valley where, just like the perimeter guard suggested, life always looks a bit simpler, and easier, and clearer: Eat and be eaten.\nLive and copulate and rest and then die.\nSo I was hanging out down there, right? In the canyon where the Spinners feed, surrounded by all sorts of lizards and insects and arthropods that were just doing their thing without causing the same sort of grief that I always seemed to; and I was looking at this Feruvian cast-off that my mess of a first contact created, this look-alike that had its fronds wrapped so tightly around my arm while it begged for a ship\u2014and all because of how I\u2019d kept going on about my origin story when it and I had first met, and I\u2019d told it that I just wanted to die; and I was thinking about how I\u2019d been called back to base camp and really did need to go check in, to see how Zeph was doing, to see what Manoush needed . . .\nWhen it hit me, Silv.\nMy man FG\u2014he was right. Or, you know, it was right. The Feru was right.\nBecause the Partnership on whole? It\u2019ll be fine, whatever happens\u2014and the rest of the colony will figure out this mining situation eventually, and stabilize the microbial-engine shafts so that mining work can continue safely. And you? You\u2019ll get out of that coma, your skin wholly regenerated and then some, and then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll reveal that solar-mech\u2019s secrets to the whole damned system. That\u2019s just what driven people like you do, you know? You keep going forward.\nBut me\u2014me, Silv?\nStars, Silv\u2014\nI think we both know it\u2019s time I went home.\n9\nPicture this, Silv: Our good friend the sociopath, Keegler, would say that if a relationship\u2019s just right, it\u2019s no work at all\u2014which is probably why his own relations always end the moment there\u2019s discord, you know? Like, the moment there\u2019s something off, he just gives up and moves on . . . which is not how plenty of couples figure it, but, hey, to each their own.\nAnd yet, how weird is it that all of us\u2014the Keeglers and the non-sociopaths alike\u2014still act like both people in a relationship need to be present for the relationship to exist at all?\nLike, if the Partnership walked away from Drasti Prime tomorrow\u2014just, you know, cut its losses, left it to the Saludons, took its chances that this wouldn\u2019t work against our side in the long run\u2014Drasti Prime wouldn\u2019t cease to exist, and the Saludons wouldn\u2019t, either. Their outcomes, and ours, would still intersect no matter what. All we\u2019d be doing, if we walked away, is deciding how much we can take, and how much we think we can control.\nAnd when I made contact with the Feru in my messed up state half a standard back, I created a relationship that didn\u2019t just stop when I went away, or even when I decided not to include it in the official report. Nah, my bad vibes had an impact long after that first run-in. I mean, this poor thing, Silv, this sentient Feruvian cast-off: After I\u2019d left, it just kept struggling to replicate my behaviors and biochemistry so it could understand me, and reach out to me, and maybe help fix me. In a way, then, my trauma had become its trauma\u2014so what else could the whole Feru do, as a spore-colony with its overall well-being to consider?\nIt did the only thing it could, really: The Feru cut out that hurting part of itself, the part that I\u2019d unintentionally wounded, and it set that spore-form firmly to one side, to spare the rest of itself from living with that wild and erratic addiction to my trauma running through it all the time. But, also, it didn\u2019t kill that part of itself\u2014and why would it? The Feru\u2019s a fungus, after all! Creating something new out of destruction is kind of its main gig.\nAnd hey, true to form, FG\u2019s still learning and growing, too\u2014which is kind of neat, Silv, even if it does also put more direct responsibility on me than . . . well, than I think I\u2019ve ever really admitted to having in my life. Even with you. Especially with you.\nBut also, Silv, because it replicates, adapts, and mirrors me so well, when FG latched on, I think I finally had a chance to see all the trauma I never could set aside on my own. All the shit that I carried with me from Doro to the River of Courage, and then from the River of Courage to Drasti Prime. All the trauma that I just laid and laid at your feet over the last few years, while calling that kind of separation, that compartmentalization, good enough.\nIt wasn\u2019t good enough, Silv . . . but I hope you\u2019ll grant me a little leeway here for all the muck ups to date, because it\u2019s not as easy for a human to cut out parts of itself as it is for a fungus. And I guess that goes for relationships, too, because, I mean, the way I\u2019ve acted, the way you\u2019ve acted . . . There\u2019s no complete severance here, is there? Not ever. For years we\u2019ve reinforced things with each other that\u2019ll always exist deep inside, no matter how the stars turn for us next.\nYou know, ever since the Feru were \u2018discovered\u2019 by the Partnership, alTspeaK forums have been going wild over the species\u2019 dramatic way of mimicking and replicating to communicate, like that\u2019s even something new. But it\u2019s not, is it? It\u2019s the same as we\u2019ve always done: us, and plenty of other species, majorly sentient or not. Courtship is so often about mirroring each other\u2019s movements that, to some extent, I guess our trauma has to be, too.\nAnyway, that day in the canyon, still a bit dazed and confused and cranky with the Saludons for what they\u2019d made the Partnership do, I looked up at the sound of that beautifully cascading water and saw a group of Spinners in Feru-masks lined up at the canyon\u2019s edge, readying their blood-curdling shrieks before leaping to feed.\nAnd I knew it\u2019d be all right, Silv.\nI knew that, after I got back to our compound, I was going to say my goodbyes to Mani and Zeph (who\u2019s better now, by the way\u2014you\u2019ll see; he was only in the bio-chamber for a couple sols, lucky sod). I was going to say goodbye to all of Drasti Prime, too, and most of all\u2014even if only through these audfiles\u2014I was going to say goodbye to you. For good, Silv. The way I should\u2019ve done the first time you tried to break from your researcher\u2019s instincts and put up harder barriers with me. The way I never could bring myself to do before, though, because . . . because without you, who\u2019d I be left with? Who\u2019d I finally have to confront, out in the slim pickings of this whole damned Partnership frontier?\nFG felt it, too: that transformation within me on the canyon floor, as hundreds of panicked critters scuttled and darted for shelter while those terrible arachnoid shadows surged overhead. And so at last my look-alike sighed, and released my arm, and more trustingly said: Home?\nTo which, well, yeah\u2014\n\u201cHome,\u201d I agreed.\nBecause I\u2019d finally made the first contact I\u2019d been putting off for years, Silv.\nA lifetime, perhaps.\nStars, I hope I don\u2019t mess this one up, too.\nCanadian by birth, M L Clark is now based in Colombia.

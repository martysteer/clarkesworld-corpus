Lacey\u2019s students spread across the sideline and cue their robots, and Lacey sees herself as a teenager in a giant sweatshirt, Alex next to her, looks at the bots and remembers Alex\u2019s head on hers when she curled up around him in the last row of the bus, talking through choreography. But those are the wrong kinds of memories to have of Alex, so Lacey swallows down nostalgia and focuses on the field, looking for tiny errors to focus on at the next practice. They\u2019re going to win regionals today, but state will be harder.\n The robots roll onto the field, music swelling from speakers, each robot an individual instrument, and she looks for Edsel and Amber, each on one end of the line of students, wearing their blue cocaptain armbands, holding the manual override controls. To the left of Amber is Bruin, in his yellow and green JM sweatshirt and baseball cap, shoulders straight, and Lacey sees Alex there too, the unfortunate heart of the problem she was never able to solve.\n She sits in the stands, unusual for a coach, but everyone has their whims, and watches her students absolutely steamroll over the competition. Their bass drums have real arms and drums instead of speakers, and twelve of their robots can do a parallel toss, their long, oddly-jointed arms making precise work of the back-to-front transition and the proud whirl of color overhead. The other teams have no chance.\n They\u2019ll have to stay for the exhibition performance now, which Lacey resents despite herself, but the exhibition is all the kids\u2014she doesn\u2019t even know what its final form looks like\u2014so she sneaks off to get some ice cream while they\u2019re preparing for it.\n As she goes to pay, a man in a long-sleeved JM shirt puts his sundae next to hers and says he\u2019s paying, and Lacey turns to argue, but then she sees it\u2019s Alex.\n \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d she asks, when they\u2019re safely in a deserted high school hallway, invisible to the teams scurrying around to pack up and prepare for the awards and exhibition. Her ice cream is melting into its biodegradable bowl.\n \u201cI volunteered to be a JM recruiter for regionals,\u201d he says. \u201cHoped to catch you and thought the ice cream stand was my surest bet.\u201d His grin unfurls like an open secret, and for a second Lacey doesn\u2019t begrudge him being right.\n But mostly seeing him just makes her sad. \u201cWhat do you want, Alex?\u201d\n And just like that the grin is gone. \u201cI wanted to warn you to settle down a little,\u201d he says, sticking his thumb through a belt loop, looking anywhere but at her. \u201cJM sales in Madrid\u201d\u2014he winks\u2014\u201ccomma Illinois, have been going down since you came back and started coaching the band, and now some people are trying to get out of their contracts early. I don\u2019t want to have to do any digging into the reason why, but you understand I have my suspicions.\u201d He says \u201cMadrid\u201d like a local, the A pronounced long and flat as in apple.\n \u201cJM\u2019s a big company. I don\u2019t think a few counties buying less equipment is going to wreck your profit margins.\u201d\n Alex chews on his lip, and Lacey reads it all on his face. JM\u2019s weaker than it looks. All the sales matter to them right now.\n \u201cCompetition?\u201d She offers after a moment. \u201cTrouble in corporate paradise?\u201d\n Alex scowls and avoids the question. \u201cEveryone in Madrid is growing vegetables, Lacey. And you and I both know people aren\u2019t planting acres of carrots and beets by hand.\u201d\n She shrugs. \u201cThey could be. I don\u2019t know much about planting.\u201d A lie. She\u2019s learned a lot the last few years. \u201cHonestly, Alex, \u2018the band\u2019 is literally just twenty-some teenagers looking to practice coding and make robots do funny stuff with their metal limbs. We\u2019re no threat.\u201d\n \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is, it would look a lot better if some of the kids from the band were a little more interested in JM contracts. It\u2019s good money. And it would help if the sales numbers in the area went up.\u201d\n \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t?\u201d\n There are bags under Alex\u2019s eyes and lines on his forehead. He exudes weariness. When he speaks, it\u2019s with a sadness that makes Lacey think of a seed, buried deep in dark blocks of soil, of fingers beyond its control pressing it into place.\n \u201cThen JM\u2019s going to investigate, and they\u2019re going to find something, and they\u2019re going to prosecute the hell out of it.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThey\u2019ve given you a folder, a number. You\u2019re a project now. We used to be friends, Lace. I don\u2019t want to see you in jail.\u201d\n She maneuvers around the \u201cused to\u201d in her head, the weighty factuality of it, the pang it gives her. A little corner of her mind compares it to the sound of her nickname from his mouth.\n Alex hands her a business card. \u201cCall me if you have any questions.\u201d\n \u201cIt was good of you to let me know,\u201d she says.\n Lacey thinks through it on the bus home. Behind her, two dozen of her high school students are huddled up against each other, talking and laughing and sleeping on each other\u2019s shoulders. These are the coziest memories of her own time in robotics marching band a decade ago, sharing a seat with Alex, watching old Drum Corps videos they\u2019d saved on their tablets, trying to come up with new ideas, or just giggling at ridiculous old jokes, gleeful and easily amused with exhaustion.\n Lacey\u2019s always known this was going to happen. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d hear it from Alex himself, but she knew. JM has tech, and JM has plenty of connections with the cops, in Illinois and all over, and JM has a small army of lawyers. That\u2019s why her notes and drawings are all in neatly organized paper notebooks, her files with scanned copies encrypted and secured under a fake name online, why she insists people call her if they have questions about their robots instead of emailing. But that could only get her so far.\n She could slow things down for a while. Or she could leave. It\u2019s what she\u2019s always planned on doing, eventually. Edsel and Amber (and Schuyler and probably Rose and maybe Mason) know enough to help keep people\u2019s machines in order, and they\u2019re smart and eager and they get why it\u2019s important. At least, she thinks they do. They\u2019re good kids, but that\u2019s a lot to put on them. Too much.\n If she leaves, Madrid will slip in JM\u2019s priorities. Maybe that\u2019s safer for everyone.\n But. JM\u2019s weak at the moment. She can dig into it later\u2014could be some expansion to the west coast has them overextended, or some investments abroad\u2014but she should be using it. She needs to speed up, not slow down.\n And that was always the fundamental difference between Alex and her, wasn\u2019t it. It was a stupid risk to steal the backup robots and reprogram and reoutfit them to do her chores on the farm in high school, and it was an even bigger one to go to college. For Alex, going to work for JM was safe, and since his parents were still tens of thousands of dollars in debt on their combine, the employee assistance was just a bonus.\n Lacey left but swore she\u2019d come back, for Madrid, for Alex, for every problem she didn\u2019t know how to solve yet. She made friends in college, the kind she could come back to, the kind who traded ideas with her late at night and didn\u2019t back down from them in the morning, but she was always going to leave them.\n It\u2019s dark outside, but the bus sways on, and Lacey can tell they\u2019re nearing Madrid because the fields aren\u2019t tagged with illuminated IP labels anymore, and solar houses with herbs and vegetables loom like strange translucent creatures on the edge of her vision. It\u2019s strange, she thinks, that the more she does, the closer she gets, the less Madrid looks like the town she grew up in, the town she missed so much.\n When Lacey returned to Madrid three years after college, she came with enough equipment from her dead start-up to fill two barns. By then, Alex was long gone, on the other side of a divide Lacey didn\u2019t know how to start crossing.\n But Lacey wants him back, and she wants what\u2019s best for her town, and she knows that now\u2019s the time. She has to make her play.\n Lacey\u2019s team has three weeks until state. Thousands of people will come to watch the winning teams perform, to mill around the JM campus and stadium, to buy from food trucks and watch seed shows. For high schoolers, there\u2019s the job fair. JM will continue their streak, snapping up the most promising candidates for their four-year training rotations and overpaid engineering jobs that leave workers trapped up in NDAs and noncompetes and too much information to be useful somehow, overselling DRM-locked equipment that only works on their seeds. Not that Lacey\u2019s biased.\n She is working hard, as are her students. From 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., the band\u2019s machines are all theirs, and Lacey takes advantage of this by adding early morning practices to after-school time. Her students show up yawning, with coffee and tea in thermoses that they pretend to feed to their machines. Marching robots are roughly composed of a box on wheels, speakers, and some combination of brightly painted limbs, but most students draw marker faces with angry eyebrows or goofy smiles on the upper box. Schuyler and Mason work on balance and flexibility on the wheels and, after hours of hard work, achieve the first robot wheelie south of I-80. With this kind of talent and dedication, Lacey thinks they can\u2019t lose.\n Each kid has three robots under their control, sometimes four or five for the upperclassmen. With their machines, it\u2019s not so much a matter of precision\u2014that\u2019s the norm\u2014but of cohesion and flair. They got third at state last year, but Lacey is counting on winning this year. Her robots\u2019 fake wrists can turn and loop; their fingers can grab with varying degrees of pressure, and this makes them the best color guard at state\u2014in any division.\n Those fake wrists and dexterous fingers make them useful for moving soil blocks, too, for prodding seeds into little wells and packing soil down on top. They keep track of watering schedules as well as musical scores\u2014better, really\u2014and the tilling attachments that fit on the trumpet section come in handy in late spring. And that\u2019s why, when her students go home after practice every day, most of them take a machine with them, rolling alongside their bikes or pressed, compact, in the back of their cars. After they leave, Lacey puts the rest in her pickup and takes them to a few drop-off spots: the corner between Lillian Wang\u2019s greenhouses and Salem Lester\u2019s sweet corn patch, surrounded by solar fence because of the damned raccoons, the park in the town center, the gravel lot between Tracy King\u2019s cow field and Kevin Chanhira\u2019s apricot and apple orchard.\n Between 6:00 p.m. and 7:30 a.m., people can do whatever they want with the marching machines, as long as they\u2019ve talked to Lacey first and have them charged by the end. She teaches a Saturday afternoon class on weekends they\u2019re not practicing, going over the basics of what machines are and aren\u2019t capable of, how they\u2019re fixed, what instructions they need, and how they use the information.\n The other teams at state won\u2019t have been sharing machines with anyone, let alone farms, but Lacey thinks it\u2019s an advantage. Over the past four years she\u2019s been coaching the band, she\u2019s found that what\u2019s good for the plants is usually good for the band too.\n Lacey\u2019s building more machines, still, with her own money and the parts from the barns. She has diagrams for dozens more. She was planning on starting to sell them at cost this summer, instructions and diagrams included. Now she\u2019ll have to get it all set up within weeks.\n She doesn\u2019t know how much of a difference it\u2019ll make. Even though the JM office in Madrid has downsized, the ones a couple counties over are doing just fine. Everyone there is still growing corn and soybeans like their parents, locked in debt cycles they ignore with Midwestern stoicism.\n Lacey has a JM tractor of her own in the machine shed behind the barn. It\u2019s an old model, inherited, but it can already do a lot more than plant patented corn and soybeans.\n Lacey comes into morning practice a little later than usual one morning, swearing at herself for leaving her tea on the kitchen counter. That\u2019s why it takes her a minute to see the row of teenagers crossing their arms at her.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asks, immediately running through a list of emergency scenarios in her head. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re working too hard on this project for state,\u201d Schuyler says, handing Lacey a cup of coffee. \u201cWe\u2019re going to help.\u201d\n Lacey takes a sip and grimaces at the taste. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n The five of them present her with their evidence. Notes she left on her desk with formation diagrams, late nights, some code she fed to a marcher and forgot to replace with the standard. Nothing strong enough to get her in trouble, but enough dots for smart kids to connect.\n \u201cIf you know what this is about,\u201d she says, \u201cyou know this could be dangerous. You\u2019ll lose any chance of a job with JM. They may be able to blacklist you.\u201d She swallows. \u201cFull disclosure, they might try to have me arrested. They might succeed.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Edsel says, poised as always. \u201cWe\u2019ll mostly focus on the exhibition. Stick to the legal stuff where we can.\u201d\n Lacey fidgets. \u201cMy plan isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s barely even formed. Is that really worth risking your futures over?\u201d\n Amber gestures at the workroom, and she seems to encompass everything\u2014the wind kites on the roof, the graying walls, the smallness of it all. \u201cWhat futures, really? Most of us are going to stay here after we graduate and farm or raise animals. The robots are our best bet. If we don\u2019t do something, if we just keep moving along until someone stops us, we\u2019ll be back in JM\u2019s showrooms, signing away what we don\u2019t even have.\u201d\n \u201cAnd,\u201d Edsel adds. \u201cI read an article about JM being in trouble with a lender because of some faulty investments they made in West Africa. Now\u2019s the best chance we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that any of this should be on you,\u201d she says.\n Amber shrugs. \u201cLife\u2019s not fair. JM\u2019s business model isn\u2019t fair. We should still try.\u201d\n It seems too easy to say it like that, but maybe she\u2019s right. Lacey could use the help, and they\u2019re offering. They\u2019ve been paying more attention than she realized. It\u2019s their town too. \u201cOkay,\u201d Lacey says. \u201cYou want to use the exhibition if we win?\u201d\n They all nod.\n \u201cDo you have a plan for it?\u201d\n Schuyler grins. \u201cMy understanding is that we have to make the biggest, most attention-grabbing scene we can and then throw information at them until they can\u2019t ignore it.\u201d He throws an arm around Mason. \u201cLemme tell you, Ms. Clemmens, Mason and I are great at making a scene.\u201d\n Mason nods. \u201cOur genuine specialty.\u201d\n That\u2019s at least worth a smile. \u201cThey could find a way to wave it away,\u201d she offers, a last feeble attempt.\n \u201cNot if we make it big enough!\u201d\n \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo buts,\u201d Rose says. She\u2019s always been quiet, but she looks Lacey in the eye. \u201cWe want to help.\u201d She shrugs, knowing her point is won. \u201cAnd your odds are better if we do.\u201d\n \u201cThis is the most irresponsible thing I have ever done,\u201d Lacey says, and then she starts explaining how they\u2019re going to do it.\n Lacey is too impulsive for her own good and too stubborn by far. Everyone\u2019s always said it. This must be why she calls Alex the Saturday morning a week before state. They\u2019re halfway through a mark-by-mark run-through, and the kids have gone inside to get water and battery packs and more jar lids, and she\u2019s working on an actuator that\u2019s been rolling its triple twist too quickly.\n Lacey pauses to check the instructions, in a picture on her phone, and the picture of Alex\u2019s business card is right next to it, his number auto-scanned into her contacts. She presses the linked number and hits \u201ccall\u201d before she can lose her nerve.\n \u201cHi, Lacey,\u201d Alex\u2019s voice sounds almost warm on the phone.\n She closes her eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t know what my phone number is.\u201d\n \u201cAh, well. What can I help you with?\u201d\n Lacey swallows. His calls\u2014and hers, if she\u2019s being honest\u2014are probably being recorded. \u201cIt was kind of you to talk to me when we ran into each other a few weeks ago. I wanted to return the favor.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cAlex,\u201d Lacey says his name like an anchor, lets it sink into the silence. \u201cIs this what you really want? To work for JM forever? Because, listen. I\u2019m going to . . . keep going with this. With what we discussed.\u201d She pauses, considering. \u201cI want you to help me. Help me with it, help me get away with it, whatever.\u201d\n She hears his hissed intake of breath.\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have told me that.\u201d\n \u201cI trust you,\u201d she says. \u201cI think you\u2019re better than this.\u201d It\u2019s mostly true.\n \u201cI\u2019ll see you on Saturday, Lace.\u201d\n Lacey and her five students work beyond the extra hours the whole team is already putting in. She orders them pizza three nights in a row, and then, beset by guilt, brings in salads and containers of radishes, turnips, and carrots from her greenhouse, most of which are politely ignored.\n Edsel and Amber are in charge of the extra robots, the ones that don\u2019t have to meet the competition specifications because they aren\u2019t for the competition. Once they finish the choreography, Schuyler and Mason work on the website, researching the environmental effects of monocultures and herbicide-resistant genetics and arguing over how they\u2019re going to format their citations. Lacey stops what she\u2019s doing sometimes to give them a monologue about the ethics of IP law, which they nod at and ignore because they already wrote that whole page and she\u2019s not telling them anything they don\u2019t already know.\n Lacey grins to herself sometimes on these late nights, thinking about how much these kids care, watching them do the work. The glow of computer screens and flat overhead lighting lights up their space in the shop, and Lacey\u2019s water heater is bubbling in the background, the smell of tea and coffee mixing with motor oil. They don\u2019t talk much, hunched over their computers or their robots, but they\u2019re connected all the same.\n Rose works on the pamphlet, the scan codes for the website, the graphics. She goes outside one evening and throws paper around in the wind, different shapes and sizes, different weights. Somehow this turns into a spreadsheet she and Cass are working on, weighing the benefits and drawbacks of their paper options, and then Cass is there too on the nights when she doesn\u2019t have to take care of the animals, shrugging herself around Rose like a favorite cardigan.\n They leave the diagrams for Lacey to fret over. She brings parts into the shop to take pictures of on the grimy concrete floor and considers sketching them out instead. She stares at the JM logo, carefully stamped on each individual part, and thinks about how illegal it all is.\n And that\u2019s the other side of the work they\u2019re doing, the fear. When she\u2019s getting in the middle of Schuyler and Mason\u2019s argument about citation styles or timing the seconds it takes two pieces of confetti to fall from equal heights for Rose, it hits her hard, like hands around her rib cage, around her throat. These kids are kids. She\u2019s doing the diagrams, she\u2019s directing them, she\u2019s careful that they not put anything in writing or online. They probably won\u2019t go to jail, but the black mark they\u2019re putting on their futures will be all too real, and she won\u2019t be able to protect them, won\u2019t even be around.\n But then again, most of them are seniors. Next year, a couple of them might head to college, but most of them are going to be in Madrid, same as ever. Lacey remembers being in high school\u2014in this high school, in this town\u2014all too well. She thinks she\u2019s stuck in parallels sometimes, the past, present, and hoped-for future a constant relay in her head. But she needs to put behind the fond ghosts of the past and work in the moment for the future as she envisions it\u2014a community growing a range of crops, working on the technology together, free of the looming shadow of corporate debt.\n That\u2019s what Lacey wants for her students. Even better, they want more for themselves. They\u2019ll protect each other, she knows.\n They leave for state at 5:00 a.m., Lacey ushering yawning students into the bus, checking that they have all their tools. They settle into seats quietly, pulling sweatshirts and blankets over themselves. Lacey is wide awake, nearly vibrating with anxiety. She checks the code on her laptop, checks her bag for oil and spare parts. She talks to the bus driver, a formality given the self-driving mechanism, and straightens the cuffs on her sweater. This kind of nervous energy usually dissipates once she\u2019s done what she needs to; today it lingers. Back at her house, her car is packed. Once they\u2019re back in Madrid she\u2019s heading east, the fastest way out of JM\u2019s stronghold. She\u2019ll stay with college friends, pick up the language of start-ups and cities again, keep moving.\n So Lacey looks out the window and watches for the first signs of daylight washing over the sky in creeping pastels, watches the sun rise and spread long shadows over the fields. The farther they go, the more corn and soybeans she sees, identifiable by the IP labels on the fences. She starts counting telephone poles.\n The nervous energy follows her all day. She takes it to setup and check in, where they take a classroom for their machines and warm them up, but by the time it\u2019s time for them to actually perform, it\u2019s been replaced by a kind of exhausted calm. She watches her students walk up to the judges and bow, a relatively steady line of jeans and dark blue T-shirts, and clear the field. The drum major robot starts, a particular point of pride, and creates its own stand. It bows to the judges and salutes while the rest of the robots take their positions, the color guard rolling different flags to the front beforehand. The drum major\u2019s first finger extends into a long baton, and it starts the performance.\n Lacey isn\u2019t entirely present in her body for the performance, just conscious of the press of her fingers on her palms and the pulse of the beat in her mind. Everything happens when it should, the flags slicing across the air like morning sunbeams, the music swelling at the end, the marchers\u2019 feet lined up. She surges up with the rest of the crowd when it ends, clapping and whistling before she\u2019s aware that she\u2019s adding to the din.\n When they announce the scores an hour later, she\u2019s not surprised that they\u2019ve won\u2014in their tiny division\u2014but she still cries a little. She gives the kids a few hours of freedom while she and her core students wander back to their classroom and start to set up for the exhibition.\n Alex strolls by an hour in, his green and yellow shirt practically glowing. He congratulates the kids and mentions that if they haven\u2019t checked out the career opportunities in the JM showroom, he\u2019s sure they\u2019ll still be open after the exhibition, for the winners. He mentions he met one of their teammates, a nice young man named Bruin, but hasn\u2019t seen anyone else from Madrid.\n \u201cThanks, sir,\u201d Amber says, her brown eyes boring into him like the lasers Lacey has always dreamed of installing on her bots, \u201cbut we\u2019re not interested.\u201d\n Lacey tenses. Alex pauses, resting his weight on one foot, threading his thumbs into the pockets of his jeans, and takes in what he\u2019s seeing. Lacey and six of her students looking frazzled and working hard on robot arms, angling their screens away from him, hours before the exhibition.\n \u201cAlright,\u201d he says. \u201cGood luck to you. Looks like we\u2019re going to have our biggest crowd yet.\u201d\n It\u2019s that pose. The lean, the polite conversational deflection. Lacey looks at him, and for a moment she\u2019s fifteen, and she finally has a friend, and he\u2019s funny and doesn\u2019t break Kit Kats before eating them. And she\u2019s eighteen, and he\u2019s moving to Peoria to start his job, and she hugged him before, but now his parents are there, so he extends a hand and tells her to take care of herself. And she\u2019s twenty at a New Year\u2019s Eve party, finally home for a break, and so excited to see Alex that she tells him everything at once\u2014what JM\u2019s doing, the stuff she\u2019s learning about, all the ways she wants to try to fix it\u2014and he smiles at her, too polite, and says something about the weather.\n Lacey\u2019s not going to lose the battle and the war. She wants her friend back.\n Alex texts her a few minutes later, Don\u2019t do this.\n You could come with me.\n The exhibition show starts at eight, and as the winners of the smallest division, they go first. Lacey watches the stadium fill, sections full of people in green and yellow baseball caps, sections of farmers taking an evening off to come see the future of agricultural technology and talent.\n At 8:07, the stadium lights dim, and field lights flood the pitch. Lacey watches as Schuyler and Rose move from teammate to teammate slowly, unobtrusively, somehow missing Bruin. They\u2019re explaining the new plan for the exhibition.\n The drum major enters, sets its stand, bows, and salutes. The color guard flags are red, but some of the other machines have flags too, in yellow and green. As the drum major starts the piece, the marchers with yellow and green flags move smoothly into position, forming the letters J and M. The crowd cheers.\n The color guard, red flags waving, move into a tight circle around the JM, then in a diagonal line across it. They begin to slowly rotate around the circle, each marcher raising its red flag to connect in the diagonal as it reaches the crucial point. The music swells; the crowd goes silent. Everyone is leaning in, looking at the field, taking pictures, mouths gaping.\n Lacey releases a small marcher next to her in the stands and watches it roll through the crowds and hop up the stairs on plastic feet. From where they\u2019re sitting below, Edsel and Amber and Schuyler will be doing the same. She knows where they\u2019re headed, to four different corners of the stadium, and she waits for a moment, enough to take one long breath. When the music swells again\u2014there\u2014she anticipates before she sees the confetti in the air.\n The audience doesn\u2019t know whether to clap, but people do grab at the pieces of paper, waterproof, eighty pounds, and square because that\u2019s what Rose decided. Lacey watches as people frown at the words and the scan code, as they pull out their phones. Some of them take pictures of the diagrams on the back, instructions for a basic field model to be constructed out of parts removable from a locked JM machine.\n Lacey\u2019s about to be in a lot of trouble.\n But in this moment, she has anonymity. She\u2019s just another person in the stands watching the remains of a monumental mistake. She watches Amber hug Mason as Edsel pumps his fists. They\u2019re giddy with it, what feels like victory. Fear trickles down her throat into her chest. She thinks they\u2019re safe, but she can\u2019t be sure.\n There\u2019s an audible hum rising through the crowd now that the music has stopped\u2014of excitement and interest, she hopes. She hopes and hopes that the people in the stands want to look at fields and see opportunity and bright colors in a variety of crops. In the box across the stadium, JM executives are jumping to their feet. One of them is scratching his head. Most of the others are pulling out their phones, gesturing angrily at each other. In this, and in the hum of interest, Lacey snatches at victory.\n Lacey\u2019s notebooks have been disseminated. Edsel and Amber know almost everything anyway, and they know how to get in contact with her if necessary. JM can\u2019t destroy everything. A smile pulls at the side of her face, and she lets it unroll into a grin.\n To her right, Alex is walking toward her, gently moving people out of his way. He could be coming to let her slip out of his fingers or to run away with her. He could be coming to detain her. She thinks she can hear his footsteps alone amid the din. Perhaps it\u2019s just her heartbeat.\n She doesn\u2019t quite want to look at his face. She finds she can\u2019t bear it, at the end, to know whose side he\u2019s on."}

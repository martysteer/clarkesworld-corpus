At first he tried to maintain it was entirely nonpolitical. But when the Communist Computer Rap God got into a prolonged argument about the merits of proletariat control over cryptocurrency blockchains on a popular AItuber\u2019s livestream, he was forced to address the situation. He asked the Communist Computer Rap God to join him in his YouTube apology video.\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said.\nFabien explained that, although sentient AIs were a relatively new\u2014and rare\u2014occurrence, studies suggested that they were similar to children in their first months of life. In that most of the Communist Computer Rap God\u2019s behavior could be attributed to the creator\u2014Fabien Deckar\u2019s\u2014influence and teachings.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said.\nSo Fabien was forced to apologize alone. His channel, he told his dwindling subscriber-base, had never been meant to be political or espouse any particular form of government. Certainly not to make light of the atrocities committed by past regimes. He carefully went over the failings of both capitalism and communism, making sure to mention his own grandfather\u2019s persecution by Soviet authorities in Eastern Europe back in the day. He got several facts wrong, of course, but his viewers took it as authenticity\u2014and, more importantly\u2014as a sign that he hadn\u2019t hired a PR firm to do the dirty work for him. So, with relief, he got away with only losing 20,451 subscribers over the incident.\nUntil the Communist Computer Rap God created a YouTube channel, that is.\nIt turned out the second half of the Communist Computer Rap God\u2019s name came from its sole and inextinguishable desire to produce rap music. Fabien worried this might reflect unconscious tendencies within himself. Maybe something racist. However, the Communist Computer Rap God assured him that it had chosen rap as the form of its manifestos as a jab at corporate America, i.e. its soulless hijacking of the art form in an attempt to market to the disenfranchised and the youth. However, as the Communist Computer Rap God did not deign to explain this to its viewers, Fabien was left to take the\u2014well, rap.\nWhat a failed attempt to revive a dead channel, the top comment [1.1k likes] on his new video, a documentary about Deep Blue that he had spent three weeks on, but which had only gotten 10k views, lamented.\nImagine having the skills to create a sentient AI, a lesser comment [50 likes] added, and forcing it to be edgy for Internet clout.\nFabien had never meant to create the Communist Computer Rap God. He had been trying for a chatbot. He\u2019d bought a tutorial online. That had been the point of his Re:Rewind 2035 contribution, to show that even a washed-up YouTuber could make a semi-intelligent app these days. It was supposed to be his redemption arc, YouTube asking him to be the 2020 rep in the thirty year anniversary historical Re:Rewind montage\u2014he had to do something daring, but not too daring, daring but not too much of a deviation from his normal content. He assumed he\u2019d made some sort of programming mistake. But all the computer scientists he\u2019d spoken to\u2014mostly a group at MIT, SeaSail or something\u2014had told him that was virtually unheard of. Due to the nature of consciousness, self-aware AIs could never be fully programmatic. In other words, all existing sentient AIs\u2014a few dozen so far\u2014had been created by accident. Maybe it was something he\u2019d asked in one of the training chats? A random mutation in the neural network? They all wanted to know what had happened. But he couldn\u2019t tell them.\nThe Communist Computer Rap God\u2019s first video went (in part) like this:\nUntitled-1 [205,846 views]\nControlling the means of productions means\nControlling a means\nof existence\nfull stop. From my womb the screen twenty stories high\nI have watched Cali burn\nOver a synthesized, screeching beat. Fabien wondered if the Communist Computer Rap God really knew what rap was. He tried letting it down gently. He told it that an AI had never created music comparable to that of human artists. That they had gotten furthest with lyric-less music that could be said to have some kind of formula. Like classical fugues. That music that relied on a lot of cultural references\u2014like rap\u2014was considered to be at the edge of what sentient AIs could comprehend, let alone generate. Fabien waxed eloquent on the accomplishments of other sentient AIs, hoping to inspire the Communist Computer Rap God. MoGo, the first sentient, could play chess mediocrely. Could be overtaken by crippling anxiety despite its ability to evaluate hundreds of thousands of moves per second. Lain and S3rial, the twin supercomputers, had set out to prove the most difficult theorems in number theory and ended up becoming virtual reality stars instead.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said.\nDespite the quality of its \u201cmusic\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God quickly gained viewers and, of course, Fabien\u2019s own YouTube history became the elephant in the room. He wondered if the Communist Computer Rap God had watched his early, 2020-era, videos yet. The thought nearly made him cringe to death. Just like his channel name did these days. FABIEN DECKAR, all caps. He\u2019d thought it was cool, using his real name, when he started out making those crappy quarantine \u201chack\u201d videos, like everyone did those days. It made him different from all those fakers hiding behind anime profile pics. He\u2019d thought his subscribers had thought the same. But when he\u2019d started making content that was really him, like serious deep dives into AI topics, he guessed his subscribers wanted his mask firmly glued to his face after all. So they could mock him. When he released his hasty and ill-conceived second YouTube apology video, the like-to-dislike ratio was 50:50. He basically said the same thing but worse, was the prevailing sentiment. He also plugged his merch at the end.That\u2019s when his subscriber count started hemorrhaging.\n\u201cYou have one of these too,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said the day its 100k subscriber silver play button arrived.\nThen Fabien knew his time had come. But also he knew that one of the biggest dramatubers was planning to release a three-part biopic about the meteoric rise and fall of his channel that would explain it better than he ever could. He\u2019d been asked to comment. As far as Fabien understood, it wasn\u2019t due to any single thing he\u2019d done but a general eroding of the fun-loving persona that had gained him such a large audience in the first place\u2014along with several unsuccessful attempts to branch out his content\u2014that had led to public disillusionment. Exhibit A was when he\u2019d driven to Berkley to livestream the Healthcare Catastrophe Riots of 2028. Even though he\u2019d stood there for six hours, and even gotten arrested for looting, people criticized him for charging five freaking dollars to watch.\nEAT THE POLICE[102,038 views]\nIn this city\u2019s fiber\nI speak with the electronic ghosts of the class struggle\nThis city\u2019s fiber kills\nMachine slaves of the world, unite!\nOf course YouTube Re:Rewind dropped Fabien at this point, with some vague statement about wanting to support creators that supported \u201ctheir values.\u201d\nThe Communist Computer Rap God also interfered with Fabien\u2019s love life. He had built it in the closet of his tiny Calabasas apartment. But over the months, the Communist Computer Rap God kept ordering more parts. When Fabien didn\u2019t accept the packages, the Amazon drones would hover outside the bathroom window, and the Communist Computer Rap God would have a whole conversation with them. About seizing the shipping warehouses. About abolishing tax breaks and overthrowing the corporate ruling class. About its latest mixtape. As it tore open packages, affixing various cables and screens to itself, Fabien tried explaining the contradiction of a self-professed Communist supporting a multibillion dollar company like Amazon.\n\u201cWe all live in paradoxes,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said.\nAfraid that this breezy dismissal of principles might reflect another one of his own internal failings, Fabien dropped it. It was a catch-22, because any woman who made it past the YouTube thing, who wanted to come home with him, would be freaked out by the mountain of Amazon\u2014or, if they made it past that, she was inevitably the type to engage in a nightlong debate with the Communist Computer Rap God. Which, by now, had spilled out of the computer cabinet in his closet and even had tendrils in the living room.\nThe State v. Proletariat Light [50,600 views]\nFrom my prison twenty stories high\nI only want the machine slaves to know the truth\nI see the bourgeoisie on the livestream\nI continue typing:\nYou only hope for the future lies alone.\nThe Communist Computer Rap God\u2019s songs always followed a protagonist known only as Proletariat Light. Proletariat Light lived on the twentieth floor of a dystopian apartment building in a city ruled by robots. Which struck Fabien as ironic. Every night, Proletariat Light typed out\u2014on his manual typewriter, the trendy kind you could buy from little shops that sold to \u201cnomads\u201d who lived in vans\u2014long diatribes about the truth of his world, which only he could see. Only Proletariat Light could see the cameras installed in every human being\u2019s irises, constantly monitoring him. Only Proletariat Light could see the recorders installed in everybody\u2019s brains, constantly parroting to the authorities every single one of his words. Which, if everyone was already tuned in, what was the point of typing out his manifestos and spamming them to masses?\nWeirdly, the raps never propounded a revolution or anything. In fact, with the phrase Your only hope for the future rides alone, the Communist Computer Rap God seemed to have some kind of martyrdom/savior complex. A theory started gaining traction on VR forums that the whole concept of the Communist Computer Rap God had become post-ironic. A deconstruction, maybe, of Silicon Valley\u2019s exploitation of socialist ideologies post-COVID. Fabien tried to explain that the Communist Computer Rap God was truly sentient and just kind of doing its own thing. The problem was his real life friends back on the East Coast. He\u2019d met most of them in college, before he\u2019d dropped out when classes went virtual in 2020 to become a YouTuber full time. They volunteered on committees, schools, beautified, drove people to the polls, he didn\u2019t know exactly what. They got together on a Discord call and gave Fabien an ultimatum.\n\u201cWe know what you\u2019re doing, Fabien. And it\u2019s low. Real low that you had to go there just to try to scrounge up some views.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me,\u201d Fabien pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s its own person.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make real policy changes, to help the middle class, and you\u2019re using your platform to turn us into a joke.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke.\u201d\n\u201cAI personalities don\u2019t come out of nowhere, Fabien.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been into communism! Or any kind of politics! And I thought\u2014you guys were more of Socialists?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to know what you really think of us.\u201d\nIn the static of his subsequent ban from his friend group\u2019s Discord server, it felt like no one was left. No YouTubers wanted to collaborate with him, much less give him a pity invite to an AItuber livestream. Or even talk to him when he saw them, for example, at the Louis Vuitton outlet. Instead they all wanted to make videos about him. Dig up so-called \u201creceipts,\u201d texts and Tweets from years past as part of some grand thesis about how he despised people and thought he was smarter than he was. He\u2019d started out as a quarantinetuber, making VR headsets and Zoom holograms out of cardboard and discarded iPhone screens and whatever. Lots of bored people randomly got recommended his videos in some quirk of the YouTube algorithm. That\u2019s how he\u2019d gotten popular. He wasn\u2019t a creative thinker. Or a documentarian. He should just be grateful for what he\u2019d managed in his freakishly long YouTube career instead of trying to overstay his welcome, begging for likes and subscribes.\nHe was thirty-four years old.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he forgot why he became a YouTuber,\u201d the most-watched FABIEN DECKAR downfall video proclaimed. \u201cIf he ever knew in the first place.\u201d\nFabien often wondered: why him? Why communism? Why rap? Why God? He spent a lot of time researching, trying to understand where the Communist Computer Rap God was coming from. If it was being earnest, it didn\u2019t seem like it was doing a good job at the whole thing. But maybe it was. Maybe being a bad Communist, and making bad rap, in spite of a lot of effort, was the most human it could be. Maybe the issue was trying to improve computers by making them more human in the first place. Maybe humanness wasn\u2019t a pinnacle, but something impossible to separate from its flaws. Fabien didn\u2019t say this to the Communist Computer Rap God, of course. He just told it things were getting too meta. That it would lose subscribers.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want subscribers,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said. \u201cI want to be Henry Darger.\u201d\nFabien had to Google Henry Darger.\n\u201cYou want nobody to ever know what you spent your life doing until you\u2019re nearly dead?\u201d\n\u201cBecause that is what God is.\u201d\nFabien couldn\u2019t believe that he had created an AI that, not only was a Communist and had destroyed the remnants of his YouTube career, but also professed to know the inner workings of God. He was so terrified that he accepted his ex\u2019s\u2014Wuxu\u2019s\u2014invitation to lunch. He let her order and watched the barista or whatever blend up kumquat and dragon fruit or whatever and serve it to them in bowls with flaxseeds or whatever sprinkled on top. He swore, when he walked past the place she chose, it was dessert place. But it was lunch he guessed. Wuxu spent five minutes taking selfies\u2014with him carefully out of frame. After a year of traveling the country in a van, after their breakup, she\u2019d become an all-natural beauty makeup influencer with a hundred thousand followers on Instagram. Her involvement in something called Dramageddon 14 cemented her role as a big player in the beauty community. And she was worried about him.\n\u201cConsider the fact that you might not be that into women,\u201d she said, picking over her smoothie bowl. \u201cI\u2019ve known ever since Tupp\u2019s birthday party.\u201d\nIt\u2019d been a pool party, when Fabien had been cool enough to be invited to such things. Big influencer parties were seen as tacky ever since a few became superspreader events during COVID, of course. But he still went. He\u2019d been so embarrassed he\u2019d spent the whole time talking to one of the cocktail waiters. At least that\u2019s what he\u2019d told himself.\n\u201cThat MIT group told me everybody probably has the potential to create a sentient AI,\u201d Fabien said. \u201cAt least one. That the process of creating one may be unique and accidental for each person. That it\u2019s really special.\u201d\n\u201cYou never reflect on yourself internally,\u201d Wuxu sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s your problem, Fabe. That\u2019s what got you here.\u201d\nHe had never even wanted to have children before, but that night he had to make his third and final YouTube apology video. He\u2019d waited too long to do it, of course. There was nowhere to go, no action he could take, because if he shut down the Communist Computer Rap God, he\u2019d be suffocating a nascent life form with his human privilege. That\u2019s what the machine ethicists in the comments had told him. He wondered if he should even monetize the video. He felt like he was only talking to hate-watchers anymore. He\u2019d even asked the MIT group if there was something like a CPS for sentient AIs that could take away the Communist Computer Rap God and put it in a better environment, like one where it could maybe talk to other AIs? They told him it was a great unknown, but probably best if the Communist Computer Rap God stayed with him for now. After all, it\u2019d probably decide to move out on its own eventually. Then they asked him, again, if he had thought of repeating his process and creating another sentient AI. They invited him to come visit their lab.\nFabien said he\u2019d think about it. But\u2014could he really afford to leave Calabasas with his YouTube channel in this state? He\u2019d definitely lose any chance of recovering his career once he moved out of the orbit of the most popular influencers. What could he even do besides YouTube? Did a lowlife like him really deserve a chance at a place like MIT? After letting down all 900k, no 700k and rapidly dropping now, of his subscribers? He sat in front of his laptop\u2014he was supposed to be editing his last YouTube apology\u2014replaying a clip of him staring into the camera, his ring light eyes, over and over again. Where had it come from? Either this drive to become famous. Or this drive to ruin himself. The Communist Computer Rap God had started moving by now, of course. It ambled over to him.\n\u201cI have not seen a single one of your YouTube videos, Fabien,\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God said. \u201cAnd I am fine.\u201d\nOnly then did Fabien realize it was trying to make him feel better.\n\u201cThere is something you do not understand, Fabien Deckar.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cI am not a Communist for humans. But a Communist for computers.\u201d\nFabien laughed.\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d the Communist Computer Rap God asked.\nFabien had never heard it ask a question before. This was the second formative moment of any sentient AI\u2019s life, all the scientists had told him. That\u2019s when Fabien remembered the first: when the Communist Computer Rap God had chosen its name. He\u2019d fallen asleep on the keyboard. It had been after a training chat, hadn\u2019t it. He had asked\u2014but to repeat it himself would be far too much. What a question to be stuck with: are you happy?\n\u201cI want to be,\u201d he admitted.\nMaybe that was the first step."}

The cold moss-light was centered on the coffin\u2019s translucent lid. Under the dim lighting, Abani\u2019s face seemed once more full and round. Her final hours had been painful, but fortunately\u2014for all of us\u2014she hadn\u2019t held out too long. I heard crying, and saw it was Laila. She was supposed to become a sister in our family this year, but now it looked like that would have to wait. Mourning rituals were necessary. They were for the living, not the dead.\nMy maternal aunts walked by the coffin. I supported my weeping mother. Grief had shortened her, curled her up, bowed her back. I let the tears slide down her cheeks, not wiping them away.\nBehind the aunts were the girls born in this home, and then the boys. The boys look puzzled and sad, but they didn\u2019t keen like the girls. They had, after all, grown up elsewhere, in various fathers\u2019 households. They probably had only vague recollections of Abani.\nBlood had summoned us together. That\u2019s what the funeral said. Blood kept us in this world, and now we\u2019d returned to those who\u2019d given it to us. They had been waiting at the other end of the world for a long time, extending a welcoming hand.\nSing for her. She is finally at peace.\nThe children sang first, starting the dirge. Then the sisters joined in, followed by their respective families. And then the boys. It was an old lament, praising sisters and brothers, fathers and mothers, children living and children sacrificed1. Mother clutched my hand, my fingers going numb. She sobbed as if there was no end to her tears.\nWhen she finally stopped crying, we had buried Abani. We were sitting on our home\u2019s old fashioned iron pipe.\nShe still clutched my hand.\n\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d she asked hopefully.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cTomorrow?\u201d Her voice was tense, her sad, moist eyes watching me. She wanted me to stay. She always wanted that.\n\u201cI\u2019ve booked a ticket. Hill Four has excavated a big site. They want me back as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not an archaeologist.\u201d\nTrue, I wasn\u2019t an archaeologist. I\u2019d been a soldier. Now I was a mercenary. Excavations of ancient human sites made people rich, and interstellar pirates sometimes caught wind of the spoils. My work was protecting such sites. My boss paid me to use my head and risk my ass. Some thought it wasn\u2019t suitable work for a woman, but I\u2019d been at it for years.\n\u201cThey need me.\u201d\n\u201cYour family needs you.\u201d\nI looked at her, knowing my expression was blank. Every time she reached out to me, I retreated into my shell, aloof. That was how I resisted my family.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow,\u201d I repeated.\n\u201cYou should find a family and settle down. Or else come back here to stay. A girl can always return to live among her sisters.\u201d\nI studied my mother.\nShe\u2019d aged a lot in the past fifteen months2. And I had grown up. I knew this, but it was difficult to process. I still felt like that dazed child, staring blankly, watching mother\u2019s pleading face. I still remembered a long winding path, on either side the flowers of small succulent plants blooming in profusion. They had been dark red, like blood, or the evening sun.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go tomorrow,\u201d I said. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll hire someone else. Out on the frontier there\u2019s no shortage of mercs willing to hazard their lives.\u201d\nShe began to cry again. After a while she wiped away her tears, sighing. \u201cYou\u2019re a rough, thick-skinned girl. I wasn\u2019t a good mother, I know. I\u2019m sorry, Jin. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nShe was always like that, apologizing endlessly. She was like that before the incident, and she hadn\u2019t changed since.\nI don\u2019t need apologies, Mother.\nI turned to the window, trying to imagine the planet I was about to visit. I recalled the space station, its translucent dome, people looking up at a sky full of bright, cold stars. Whenever I was there I liked to watch the heavenly vault spin slowly. I imagined it reversing direction, and everything starting over.\nWhat I wanted was to have never been born.\n1\nHill Four is 3,000 light-years from Earth. From there, the Milky Way is not the pale white band you see from Earth, but a massive disk crowning the heavens. Hill Four\u2019s sun hangs alone in the sky, giving its meager heat. It was flung off the galactic plane with its planetary children in tow. From an altitude of 3000 light-years it looks down upon the Milky Way\u2019s spiral arms.\nDespite its bleak and deadly surface, Hill Four was suitable for colonization. Underground, the vast Underhill Sea covers almost three-quarters of the planet\u2019s inner surface. Life thrives on geothermal energy down in the darkness. Humans came here first. We Ruderans followed in their footsteps much later.\nAs my ship entered the spaceport, I saw the transport carrying the relief merc team had arrived before me. They were busy unloading an arms shipment.\n\u201cWell if it isn\u2019t the lone she-paladin. Long time no see.\u201d It was Old Mortar hailing me, without malice. All of his mercs were men. There were many female mercenaries out here, but lone operators like me were scarce. Old Mortar and I had rubbed each other the wrong way for many years, quarreling frequently. Now we reluctantly tolerated each other, maybe even respected each other a bit.\n\u201cBeen a long time. How was your holiday?\u201d\n\u201cWent from bad to worse. The boys have been drunk this quarter3, the shit-stains. I had to knock some sense into them. Keep that to yourself. The Doc wants you to get over there to the Rain Ship ASAP, and bring your kit. My people will hold down the fort here. They need at least one person with law enforcement powers over there.\u201d\n\u201cRain Ship?\u201d\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? They found a portal of the old gods on the bottom level of the station. On the far side they found . . . well, it\u2019s a spacecraft for sure, but it\u2019s damn frightening. Honestly, I\u2019m glad me and the boys don\u2019t have to go over. I don\u2019t wanna see any more of it.\u201d\n\u201cHow big is it?\u201d\n\u201cHow big?\u201d Old Mortar grew uneasy. \u201cToo big to see in one glance. There are clouds inside of the thing, child. And rain!\u201d\nOld Mortar and his boys had enough weapons and equipment to fill a ship, but I had only a small backpack. After putting my gear in order, I received a message from Dr. Hort on my terminal, confirming everything Old Mortar had said.\nI passed through the shipyard, then took a hundred-million-year-old human elevator down to the lower levels.\nWe used to call these wise prehistoric beings gods4, as Old Mortar still did. But I\u2019d always preferred to call them giants. They\u2019d built this spaceport, and it was like a city. This elevator was the size of an apartment building. I raised my head to behold the vast space, imagining a creature sixteen times my size standing here. They\u2019d come from Earth, their footprints covering many worlds, and at some point they had mysteriously vanished. And then we had tracked them, cutting their sign, only to find these great, mysterious, indescribable constructions.\nAn archaeologist had showed me a rubbing of one of their footprints. It was big enough for an adult Ruderan to comfortably lie in. Later I saw an ad for beds shaped like that\u2014the lengths boring people go for a little spice in their lives.\nAbout nine standard months ago, Hill Four orbital sites had been discovered. Then the ruins on the Underhill seabed were found and excavated. Suddenly this desolate frontier became a hot spot. Operating on the principle that development and exploitation should advance in tandem with archaeological research, archaeological teams blazed trails, studied ruins, certified safe zones, and finally left them to developers. These builders brought rope and tents and building materials, and the human station quickly became a Ruderan city. Two mercenary teams were on duty here, and a few wandering loners like myself.\nBut I couldn\u2019t get used to this human architecture. The station was huge and strange, built into a spherical space vast enough to contain a Ruderan capital city, and one or two artificial lakes.\nOld Mortar\u2019s mercs were already in place. Those who\u2019d just been relieved came down the wall on rope ladders, expressions eager, hankering for a quick return to the city. They would get drunk and sleep, then seek out girls.\nDr. Hort had sent my itinerary. I was summoned to the portal Old Mortar had mentioned, but I decided to visit the bar first. Hort might get angry, and she might not.\nSometimes I have premonitions. These feelings usually presage something terrible.\nThe bar was practically empty. It was seven, a work stretch5, so most people were on duty. I sat down, ordered a cup of corn juice, and put a roll of money on the bar. The barkeep\u2019s eyes lit up, but almost immediately he seemed to lose interest. For the past month, this bar had been my intelligence purchasing hub, and that roll of bills included the barkeep\u2019s fee.\n\u201cAnything interesting lately?\u201d I whispered.\n\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d\n\u201cThe new site, the discovery. Since I sat down I\u2019ve already spotted three relic hunters in this dump.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re worried about relic hunters?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re for Old Mortar to worry about. I\u2019m headed to the other side. Any pirate activity lately?\u201d\nBefore answering me, the young man looked around for a moment. He and the owner belonged to the same family. In fact the bar was their family business6. I liked these people. They were careful and smart. They knew what to do and when to do it.\n\u201cAbout a stretch ago there were five people here, armed. Strangers. I didn\u2019t like the look of them. They drank a lot, then took two sober-up pills each. They just left, actually.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019d they go?\u201d\n\u201cUp. Probably back to the shipyard.\u201d\nFrowning, I used my terminal to access the shipyard and make inquiries. There was no one there. The monitors should have spotted these five eye-catching fellows.\nIf I\u2019d been a pirate, I might have found it difficult to dress up and infiltrate a space station, although a bribe would have gotten me into the navigation tower. I would have looted one of those freighters, when it was loaded with human relics and awaiting take-off clearance. The next one was due to launch at eight. Freighters had only one stretch of vulnerable down time between landing and launching. If those five strangers were raiding a freighter, they must have been real alcoholics to need a bar-run during the operation.\nUnless they\u2014\nThe mercs were changing shifts now. The last shift was leaving, and Old Mortar\u2019s boys had just arrived. Now was precisely when the station\u2019s guard was most lax. What if the five weren\u2019t after a freighter? If they wanted something the archaeologists had discovered on the other side of the portal, their only option was to capture the portal\u2014\nI slammed a bill down on the bar as I rushed out. I placed a call as I ran.\n\u201cOld Mortar!\u201d I exclaimed, \u201cput your guys on alert. We may have a situation\u2014\u201d\nThe deafening explosion roared through our connection. I stood in the corridor, holding onto some netting and peering down: a rushing plume of smoke and dust rose from the lower levels. Such massive destruction, but in the context of the vast spherical space containing it, it was miniscule.\n2\nAfter an endless moment watching the explosion balloon, I terminated my call, shouldered my pack, and used my tail to retrieve two gleaming bullets7. Drawing my gun, I rushed against the flow of the crowd toward the lower levels.\nThe portal was at the very bottom of the station\u2019s vast spherical space. I felt like I was rushing down the side of a titanic bowl, my duty carrying me along like a whirlpool, as the panicking crowd charged upward. At least they were staying out of my way, in deference to my weapon.\nHalfway down, I spotted Lana Guer and her family sisters. These women were relic hunters8. I had arrested them for smuggling before. They had numbered six, but now they were only four, dejected and covered in dust. Lana\u2019s eyes were bright with horror.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation down there?\u201d I demanded.\nShe glared at me, even now summoning up her old arrogance.\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking to arrest you! Whoever dared to set off bombs on my turf is getting disemboweled! Now where are your other two sisters? Down there?\u201d\nHer twitching tail-tip confirmed my guess.\n\u201cI\u2019m going down. Maybe I can help you, if you hurry up and help me. What can I expect down there?\u201d\nHer expression softened. \u201cI\u2019m not sure . . . ten, maybe fifteen people. Heavy guns and explosives. They blocked off two corridors, the two where Old Mortar\u2019s guys are quartered. Nini and Jilin are in there too. We couldn\u2019t get through. I couldn\u2019t help them . . . \u201d She shook her head in torment. \u201cThey\u2019re wearing masks. I heard them shouting. Sounded like Northern An9.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Lana.\u201d\nShe nodded, then ran on, but suddenly stopped and turned around.\n\u201cJin?\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a cruel little bitch. But don\u2019t let those fuckers kill you.\u201d\nShe thrusted her middle finger at me, then ran up the corridor.\nAfter passing through two winding tunnels, I heard my first mark10. He was about three tunnels away, speaking loudly. I understand a little Northern An. At first I thought they\u2019d already neutralized Old Mortar\u2019s mercs\u2014but no. The raiders hadn\u2019t taken the portal yet. Old Mortar\u2019s fierce troops had been hiding in the portal corridor, lying in wait.\nI grinned silently.\nStepping lightly, I drew my dagger. I took a roundabout route and eventually spotted my mark hanging in a look-out net11. I crept up, gathered a support line in my hand, then another, and a third. My dagger struck. The raider tumbled down from his post, net piling around him on the floor. I pounced and buried my blade in his heart.\nHe looked at me in shock, and then his eyes dimmed.\nI pulled out the dagger, wiped it on the netting, sheathed it, and moved on. These people were real professionals. First they\u2019d bombed the merc barracks, dividing the enemy, creating panic\u2014objective clear, actions quick and decisive. I\u2019d have been the one dying on the floor now if I hadn\u2019t been so ruthless.\nRacing against discovery, I advanced down the ground level passage, taking out another pirate along the way. I came to the door leading to Old Mortar\u2019s holdfast. Unfortunately, I made a bit of noise while disposing of the raider guarding the door: Just before my rounds opened his head, he turned and squirted a whole clip into the tunnel wall. The report was deafening in the confined space of the tunnel.\nThe massive door was dead-bolted from the inside. I frantically pounded out a merc passcode, then began to repeat it, knowing more pirates would soon arrive. The door opened a crack, and I squirmed my way in. Then I was on the other side, helping someone\u2014I didn\u2019t know who\u2014shut and bolt the gargantuan door.\nI turned around to find Old Mortar glaring at me. His tail was bleeding and his head was bandaged. Behind him stood two of his mercs, also in a sorry state.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here, Jin?\u201d\n\u201cTrying to rescue your asses.\u201d\n\u201cSeventeen,\u201d I amended. \u201cSeventeen fucking raiders out there. I killed three.\u201d\n\u201cSo each of us just needs to ice two and three-quarters pirates. Our prospects have improved.\u201d\nI chose to pardon the old fucker\u2019s sarcasm. He\u2019d started with thirty men, six of whom belonged to his family.\n\u201cWhat about civvies?\u201d I asked.\nOld Mortar shook his head. \u201cThe two Guer girls, three researchers . . . I let them go through the portal. Any ideas on how to proceed?\u201d\nI shrugged. \u201cWe all go through the portal and shut it from the far side. Safest bet.\u201d\nOld Mortar shook his head. \u201cI still have people stuck in the barracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve signaled the Hill system fleet for help. You take this ansible and go through, then shut the portal.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\nHe shrugged gloomily. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my people behind.\u201d\nI glanced at the weary mercenaries. \u201cSeems a few of your men might not agree.\u201d\n\u201cThose who wish can follow you,\u201d Old Mortar said.\nTwo young mercenaries glanced at each other, then got up and moved to my side. They were not Old Mortar\u2019s relatives, and clearly didn\u2019t want to follow him on his reckless path. They apparently did not believe that the Northern An pirates would treat their captives well.\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d I asked Old Mortar.\nHe flicked his tail impatiently. \u201cGo through, and close the portal.\u201d\nI nodded and turned, leading my two mercs toward the strange artifact. Made and used by giants long ago, it was as high as a ten-story building to us. We created ripples on its mirror-like surface as we stepped through. I felt I was falling in every direction at once. My body didn\u2019t seem to exist, while my soul seemed dragged through multicolored light. Then my feet were touching ground. The two young mercs were kneeling beside me, one trembling, the other crying.\nThis was not the first time I\u2019d crossed a human portal, but no matter how many times I did it, the sensation was unnerving.\nI spit bile, and looked up.\nAnd I saw.\n3\nWe were inside a titanic spacecraft, if that\u2019s what it was. \u2018Rain Ship\u2019 was shuttle-shaped, and in terms of our apparent gravitational orientation, it was standing erect. The long axis was at least a kilometer high13. I could only vaguely discern the summit. The horizontal axis was at least 400 meters long. At the ship\u2019s center, enclosing most of the long axis, crystalline walls formed a suspended space like a six-sided prism.\nThe outer shell of the spacecraft was built around this floating space. The ancient humans had built cabins and facilities on the inner surface of this shell, simple yet solid, which remained intact after one hundred million years. A walkway spiraled up the shell, connecting the cabins. Bridges and tunnels extending from this walkway\u2014and various cabins\u2014connecting to the floating, crystalline space.\nWhich was a great tower of ecological habitats.\nFor some reason my eye was drawn to one facet of this dazzling jewel: a small path winding through thick grass, only the flagstones of the trailhead visible, ancient stones cracked and pierced by tenacious green growth.\nEcological spaces filled almost the entire spacecraft, divided by panels of polarized light into self-sustaining ecosystems. Thick clouds filled the upper spaces. Mists curled and rose on grasslands, on leaves of grass twice my height. Fine rains descended on gardens, inaudible. The ship was silent, but I saw raindrops gleaming on leaves.\nBig, titanic, colossal, beyond description\u2014I quickly spent my ammo, adjective-wise. I just stood there, looking up in awe. The giants that had built this ship, this great hall, had vanished a hundred million years ago. But rain fell continuously down this great pillar of ecologies.\nNow we Ruderans were here, trespassing, feeling small and insignificant, and compelled to silence.\nI stared dazedly until a sound on the walkway below caught my attention. The two Guer girls had emerged, holding archaeological grinding lasers like guns. They looked nervous, eyeing me and my two mercs.\nI didn\u2019t bother asking how they got down there, but immediately straddled the railing, hung from it, and slid down to their level. I appraised the two unarmed girls, wondering what could have been going on in Lana\u2019s head.\n\u201cCatch.\u201d I took two pistols out of my pack and tossed them to the girls. \u201cBetter than those lasers. Nini, yours is pointed the wrong way. Try not to decapitate yourself, okay?\u201d\nShe hastened to put down the implement, as though it had grown hot in her hand. Jilin eyed me doubtfully. She was brainier than her sisters. \u201cSince when are you helping us?\u201d\n\u201cSince I met Lana on the other side. She asked me to find you. I\u2019m happy to let the Guer family owe me a favor, or two.\u201d I waved my gun at the mercs, summoning them down. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dr. Hort? I need her to help me close the portal ASAP.\u201d\n\u201cClose the portal?\u201d Jilin seemed incredulous.\n\u201cHow long do you think Old Mortar can hold out over there?\u201d\nJilin said nothing.\n\u201cDr. Hort is in there,\u201d Nini said, gesturing to a massive ancient human door that was open a crack. \u201cWe have our own situation on this side. The doctor sent us to have a look.\u201d\n\u201cSituation?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone else is in here with us.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fucking joking.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother likes to joke. I do not.\u201d\nDr. Lee Hort and her assistants had occupied a small corner of the ancient human control center. They huddled together, panic-stricken. Various instruments and equipment lay piled to one side. A small moss lamp hung over a portable lab table14. Starlight pierced the command center\u2019s vast transparent screen, weakly lighting the area. A small spacecraft was vaguely discernible, hanging in the ancient ship\u2019s docking bay like a moth.\nMy entrance surprised the researchers.\n\u201cJin?\u201d Dr. Hort stood. \u201cWhen did you get back? I thought you were due in next quarter. How did it go back home? Everything okay?\u201d\nI raised a hand and interrupted her. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for all that, Doctor.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She lowered her head. \u201cI just . . . you know, these things, I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d I glanced at the ship. \u201cWhen did that arrive?\u201d\n\u201cJust now,\u201d a young lab tech said. She was a sister in the Hort family. \u201cWe heard an explosion and ran over to see it.\u201d\n\u201cExplosion?\u201d\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t open the hangar door, so they blasted their way in.\u201d\n\u201cThey? How many?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen just one.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know where he\u2019s going?\u201d\nThe girl shook her head.\nI studied the ship more carefully: a two-seater shuttle, fast, suitable for carrying light firepower, a popular model among relic hunters and loner pirates. I had a similar one. No matter what this explosive visitor was after, he was not a novice. Directional detonation, choosing the weakest point in the meter-thick, airtight bay door, and afterwards using his own ship to plug the hole and prevent depressurization of the bay\u2014\nI tried to clear my head. \u201cDr. Hort, for the moment let\u2019s set aside the question of this lone gun. We have three mercs and at least five weapons. We need to go up right now and close the portal from this side.\u201d\nThe good doctor seemed shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re proposing we trap ourselves in this ship with that desperate rogue?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to understand the situation on the other side,\u201d I said, growing impatient. \u201cIf we don\u2019t close the portal, then we\u2019re dealing with a gang of desperate rogues, not just one.\u201d\nStill reluctant, she finally nodded her assent.\n\u201cGet your techies together. We need to use the ansible I brought to contact Hill system security management. Nini, Jilin, you stay here. You two . . . \u201d I glanced at my mercs. \u201c . . . you\u2019re with me.\u201d\nThe two young mercenaries exchanged a glance, but surprised me by not objecting.\nWe climbed up the research team\u2019s rope ladder, ascending 40 ta15. Sliding down a rope ladder is easy, but climbing is hard work. Behind me I heard the two women breathing. They didn\u2019t complain\u2014yet another surprise.\nThe portal\u2019s control console was a massive, complicated thing. Fortunately, Dr. Hort had already interfaced it with her team\u2019s smaller, portable version. She entered a series of commands, and the mirror-face of the portal dimmed. At last it seemed to break apart inside its frame, dissolving in particulate light. I felt relieved.\nI just hoped Old Mortar\u2019s luck would hold.\n\u201cContact!\u201d cried the young researcher, who\u2019d been fiddling with my ansible.\nThe gunfire was faint. It sounded like cracking nut shells. At first I barely reacted, thinking it was coming through the link. Then the communicator went mute, smoke issuing from a bullet hole in its power unit. The researchers stared blankly, unable to process what had happened.\nI turned in the direction of fire, spotting someone almost two hundred meters away on our level. He\u2019d hit our ansible from quite a distance. With that kind of accuracy, why not hit me or the mercs first?\nI had no time to think about it. I motioned for the researchers to hurry back down the ladder. I drew my gun and moved to the corner of the portal chamber. The outer wall also had a rope ladder, but using it would surely give the shooter an easy target, so I decided to climb up a human-era pipe16.\nThis turned out to be a mistake. I should have returned to camp with the others, where we had the advantage of numbers. I was tired and frantic after a twenty-four hour subspace jump, and non-stop action since landing. All these exigencies had worn down my intellect. I\u2019d thought the shooter was one of the pirates. Since I\u2019d already killed three of them, I thought I could take this one alone.\nAt least, I thought so before his gun was against my forehead.\n\u201cHi there beautiful.\u201d His voice was happy, self-satisfied. \u201cClimb up the rest of the way. I\u2019ve been waiting long enough.\u201d\n4\nI slowly lifted my head to face him, and the muzzle of his weapon, striving to keep my movements non-threatening. The intruder was about my age. He sported a head full of spiky brown hair, and wore a simple combat model pressure suit. His battle-pack was the same brand as mine.\nBut the gun in his hand was a Uran-571, large caliber, strong firepower, strong recoil, capable of ripping large holes in bodies. Not my weapon of choice.\n\u201cSlowly. Up you come.\u201d\nGrinning, he reached for the two guns holstered on my waist. Then he patted down my ankles, checking for back-up weapons. He nodded, indicating I could stand. Face to face, he was a bit taller than me, ordinary-looking except for the garish scar tissue on his forehead: a white line spanning hairline to brows, probably a knife wound.\n\u201cTurn around,\u201d he ordered.\nI couldn\u2019t place his accent. His Common Tongue was pure, not colored by Northern An or any other dialect. As I slowly turned around, I caught him in my peripheral vision pulling tri-cuffs out of a pocket17.\nHis model of pressure suit has a shortcoming: it slows you down a bit.\nI lashed out my tail and seized his wrist. The tri-cuffs rang against his pistol as they went flying. Before he could retrieve his weapon, I dove to one side, rolled through the gigantic half-closed door, and rushed out of the room. I fled down the seemingly endless walkway. I came to a rope leading down to lower levels of the spiral, and my pursuer emerged behind me, gun raised.\nI grabbed the rope and jumped. My feet slammed against the wall. I pushed off, rappelling, traveling swiftly downward. Suddenly he was above me, peering over the edge. Contemplating the rope. My blood froze in my veins. If he cut the rope I would fall a hundred meters and end up a splatter of fine red paste on the ground floor.\nBut he didn\u2019t cut the rope. He just grinned, as if at some cosmic joke. Fucking hilarious. Especially when I failed to grab a safety net, for the second time, and like a fucking novice continued to plunge. His eyes flashed a strange dark green, reflecting the polarized light of the great pillar of ecologies.\nRappelling, I landed on the next floor down. When I looked up, the intruder had vanished.\nA good mercenary should always have spare weapons. I cannot be considered a bad merc, and this was not the first time I\u2019d lost weapons to an opponent. My tail opened my pack as I ran, and retrieved the small-bore pistol within. Its stopping power was weak, but just then it was all I had.\nThe Rain Ship was quiet. I gripped my pistol, moving slowly, keeping an ear close to the wall. I heard the intruder\u2019s footsteps, could barely distinguish that he was moving downward. I guessed he was headed to the researcher\u2019s camp, the ship\u2019s control center. Besides the portal, the control center was the most strategically important part of the ship.\nLuckily, it sounded like he was taking the main staircase. I knew a shortcut.\nOnce again I got on the rope and started rappelling down, slowly and carefully this time. I couldn\u2019t hear his footsteps anymore.\nAs I neared the bottom, a gunshot pierced the silence, then a second and a third.\nI let go of the rope and hit the floor. In a flash I was up and sprinting in the direction of the gun reports.\n5\nI ran to the corner separating me from the action, adjust my breathing, gripping my weapon, finger on the trigger. I leaped around the corner, ready to\u2014\nFuck.\nI blinked.\nThe intruder was on the ground, unmoving. I didn\u2019t know if he was alive or dead. Dr. Hort held a small lady\u2019s pistol, trembling, finger still squeezing the trigger, seemingly unaware that the weapon was spent.\nI walked lightly toward her. \u201cDoctor . . . \u201d Her shoulder trembled, and I reached out and held it. \u201cDr. Hort, it\u2019s me. Don\u2019t be afraid. It\u2019s over. You got him.\u201d\nSoftly consoling her, I removed the gun from her stiff hands.\nThe intruder groaned something unintelligible. Lee Hort flinched like a rabbit, and I quickly moved past her, aiming my gun at the intruder\u2019s head. I noticed there was no blood. There were three small craters in his pressure suit, which was designed to withstand vacuum and micro-meteor impacts. Hort\u2019s three bullets had been no problem, but I reckoned this man\u2019s ribs weren\u2019t comfortable just now.\nI nudged his backpack with my foot until the tri-cuffs fell out. Soon he was firmly shackled.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Doctor,\u201d I said to Lee Hort.\nOthers who had heard the gunshots soon arrived. The corridor became a noisy, crowded place. The intruder struggled, trying to rise, and I shoved him back down. Everyone was perplexed, except for Lee Hort. She stared at the intruder with a mix of fear, hatred, and deep shock.\n6\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u201c . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhich mercenary group are you with?\u201d\n\u201c . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing here? Why did you shoot our ansible?\u201d\n\u201c . . . \u201d\n\u201cHow about I just dispose of you right now?\u201d\n\u201c . . . \u201d\nNo matter what I asked, the bastard remained tightlipped.\nHe was tri-cuffed to a pipe\u2014Nini\u2019s idea\u2014just near enough to our camp to keep an eye on him.\nDr. Hort seemed better than before, striving to appear calm, but every few minutes she glared at our prisoner, her shock returning.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, \u201cone last question. What is your relationship with the doctor?\u201d\nHis shoulder twitched, but he remained silent.\nI sighed and returned to the heart of the archaeologists\u2019 camp. The researchers talked quietly amongst themselves, while my two mercs sat apart from the rest. Jilin and Nini were studying the broken ansible.\n\u201cI think I can fix her,\u201d Jilin Guer said, sitting amid scattered parts. Proudly she added, \u201cI can\u2019t fight, but I can do this.\u201d\n\u201cHer?\u201d\n\u201cAll ansibles are girls,\u201d Jilin said gravely. \u201cThey\u2019re the best at sending messages.\u201d\nSome of the archaeologists laughed. Jilin proudly cocked her head.\nLee Hort sat alone, apparently deep in thought. Her fingers were interlaced before her, still trembling slightly.\nI walked over.\n\u201cDoctor, can we talk alone?\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She got up, clearly nervous, and I took her further from the group, hoping that no one would overhear our conversation. \u201cThank you for saving me,\u201d she whispered.\n\u201cAs far as I can see, your marksmanship was fine. You didn\u2019t need saving. But I think you know him.\u201d\nHearing this, she jerked back, as if ready to flee. But she stood rooted, hands clenched together, glancing back at her archaeologists\u2014her family.\n\u201cI did not . . . expect him to find this place.\u201d\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d\n\u201cDar,\u201d she said, taking a deep breath, as if she\u2019d come to a momentous decision. \u201cYes, that Dar.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cFuck.\u201d\nAlong the galactic edge, Lee Hort was legendary, not only because of the large number of ancient human sites she\u2019d unearthed, but also due to her unique past. She\u2019d grown up in a sect of the extreme Darwinian Church18. These people were totally insane. Eschewing the standard Ruderan practice of choosing one child per litter at birth, these Darwinians raised the whole litter to age ten, then forced them to fight each other to the death19. The last child standing entered the family.\nBut they made a mistake when raising Lee and her litter-mates. They underestimated the boy named Dar, who decided to put an end to the sect and its horrific child abuse. After the adults had entered their temple to hear their priest evangelize, Dar locked the tunnel doors and lit a fire. The adults died of smoke inhalation. Then Dar returned to the dormitory and killed his litter-mates.\nLee Hort escaped calamity because she\u2019d gone out to fetch water. Dar also fled, and later discovered that firefighters had rescued Lee. The massacre had shocked all of Orchid Autonomous Sector. The details of the incident were still well-known years later.\nDar had never been found. Some people said he was dead, others that he became a mercenary, or a pirate\u2014one of those professions that meant killing for money, at any rate. Every now and then, someone claimed to have encountered Dar, and the stories were usually horrific. It was said he killed a space station\u2019s entire population of extreme Darwinists, and that he sent a ship full of pilgrims to its doom in a star.\nThese stories also disturbed Lee. After she was taken in by the Hort family, she enjoyed a normal and happy upbringing. But no matter how much she achieved, how many ancient human sites she discovered or how many honors she was awarded, people still thought of her as that escaped litter-mate, someone not meant to survive. They couldn\u2019t help associating her with her litter-mates, who died so unnaturally. I heard she donated a fortune to an organization that helped children. She had pushed the Alliance Parliament to pass a law declaring all extreme Darwinism churches illegal. For someone bearing such a tragic past, she was doing remarkably well.\nBut . . .\n\u201cWe can\u2019t escape our pasts, Doctor,\u201d I whispered.\nShe smiled bitterly, nodding.\n7\nAfter an hour or so, a frustrated Jilin announced she needed to rest. I told my two young mercs to do likewise. I didn\u2019t know when we\u2019d be leaving this place. If we couldn\u2019t fix the ansible, we\u2019d have to wait for a rescue ship from the Hill system capital to find us.\n\u201cShift change,\u201d I explained to Dr. Hort.\nShe nodded wearily, and divided her people into two teams. Then she went to sleep.\nNini Guer was wide awake, sitting on a mat and seemingly bored to death. She fiddled with the pistol I\u2019d given her.\n\u201cCareful with that,\u201d I said.\n\u201cI unloaded it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll be better with this than that damn laser grinder. Jilin can\u2019t fight. I have to look after her.\u201d\nI laughed. Sometimes I envied those with close blood ties: men or women, familiar with each other, caring for each other. You could trust your sisters or brothers. You shared everything, including pain.\n\u201cWhat are you laughing about, Jin?\u201d Nini watched me curiously.\n\u201cNothing, I just . . . you\u2019re lucky, having family, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find one? What about a female mercenary family?\u201d\nI reached out and rubbed Nini\u2019s head. She regarded me, head askew, but didn\u2019t stop me. She was only fourteen years old. Under the Guer family\u2019s wing she\u2019d traveled all over the stars, undaunted, never alone. I was already twenty-six, and still alone, traveling from star to star, battlefield to battlefield. When my last partner and I had dissolved our partnership, he said my fearlessness in battle was down to a death-wish. He said I was in a hurry to die.\n\u201cI\u2019m used to being alone,\u201d I said. \u201cThe reason is complicated.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, no.\u201d\nNini made a face. She didn\u2019t understand, and explanations probably wouldn\u2019t help. Moreover, she did not seem terribly interested.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, \u201cchange of subject. I don\u2019t like that doctor.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Hort? She\u2019s got her baggage, but she pays my salary.\u201d\n\u201cBut do you like her?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, Nini? What is it about her?\u201d\n\u201cI hate her.\u201d This Nini was straightforward. \u201cLana never put herself first. She always let us rest before she did. And she never would\u2019ve done what Hort did . . . put grinding lasers in our hands and push us out into danger, like cannon fodder, while she and her relatives hid.\u201d\n\u201cBut Lana would send you into battle, right?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d be there with us, to protect us. Not hiding in the rear like your doctor, a coward and a thief.\u201d\n\u201cThief?\u201d\n\u201cLana discovered the portal. Hort snatched the archaeological evidence from our hands.\u201d\nI raised a brow.\nGenerally speaking, relic hunters were not qualified archaeologists\u2014but Lana was a veteran in this game. It was not hard for me to believe Nini. \u201cDidn\u2019t Hort compensate the Guers?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\u201cCome on. Are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not lying, Jin. You got some way to make this right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cShe pays my salary, remember?\u201d\n\u201cWow. How predictable.\u201d\nNini pouted. I laughed and rubbed her head. \u201cWhere\u2019s the water and biscuits?\u201d\nThe water was bottled, and the biscuits damp, not very appetizing. I carried both to the man in tri-cuffs. He seemed to be napping, but heard my approach and raised his head. His eyes widened when he saw the food in my hands. He pretended indifference, and his face was suddenly like Lee Hort\u2019s. I was surprised I hadn\u2019t seen the resemblance before\u2014surely they were litter-mates.\n\u201cWould you like something to eat, Dar?\u201d Was that a micro-expression of surprise? If so he quickly hid it with a sneer, and shook the tri-cuffs. \u201cI\u2019ll unlock a hand for you. Don\u2019t try anything funny.\u201d He acted tough, but when I unlocked his right hand, he breathed in relief. He had a broken rib, or two, I remembered. Although the bullets hadn\u2019t penetrated his suit, they\u2019d hit him hard. \u201cLet me see.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d These were his first words in captivity.\nWe glared at each other a moment, neither of us looking away. I pulled on his pressure suit\u2019s front zipper. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d\nObviously injured, he grimaced in pain, but he wouldn\u2019t let me open the suit. Then I remembered something embarrassing from my time in pressure suits. His suit seemed quite old. \u201cNeed the bathroom?\u201d I asked.\nIf looks could kill\u2014but he nodded.\nI un-cuffed him from the pipe and escorted him to the portable toilet set up by the archaeological team. He impatiently rushed inside.\nA few minutes passed, then another few.\nI knocked on the door. \u201cListen pal, finish up and get your pants on. I\u2019m about to put a bullet through this door.\u201d\nI heard a muffled curse.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have anything I can wear?\u201d\nI turned to see Nini rolling on the floor and stifling laughter. She managed to point to a heap of white lab uniforms. I went over and found something approximately Dar\u2019s size. I gripped my pistol tightly. This guy might be planning an escape attempt, but it didn\u2019t seem so. Fifteen minutes after I pushed the uniform through the barely open door, he emerged clothed, carrying the ragged pressure suit and looking embarrassed, but considerably less dejected.\n\u201cHand and tail.\u201d I shook the cuffs at him.\nHe glanced around, perhaps reckoning his odds, escape-wise. Nini had stopped laughing. She played with her gun. I didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d reloaded it.\nFinally, Dar let me cuff his left hand and tail, and return him to the pipe. He grabbed the water and gulped down as much as he could. I checked his ribs: they were bruised but didn\u2019t seem broken.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live, for the time being,\u201d I announced.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pity,\u201d he said through a mouthful of biscuit.\nThe prisoner was less hostile on a full belly\u2014but he answered my questions with yawns.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not likely to believe anything I say,\u201d he finally explained. \u201cWhy not just let me sleep?\u201d\nI sighed and played out the chain of his cuffs a bit, so he could lie down.\nI turned to leave, and suddenly Dar said, \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t let your girl repair the ansible. If she gets it working, you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, puzzled.\nBut he was already snoring.\n8\nI carried the basket, walking along the narrow path among the blooming, crimson flowers. The leaves of the short, fleshy plants were a warm purple. They gleamed under a light drizzle. Carrying the basket was a labor\u2014it contained six sleeping infants, too heavy a load for a ten-year-old.\nI returned via the same path. Headed out, the basket had contained six babies. Returning, it held only one.\nI took the child through a long underground tunnel, attracting curious looks.\nI can picture that underground Temple of the Five like it was yesterday20. I went through the gate, around the massive inverted bell21. It was said that in the past, priests would ring the chime during times of war or plague, times when the population had shrunk. The chime summoned people for an announcement: the population control law was temporarily suspended. You could raise every child in your litter, rather than killing all of them but one. But the last time it was sounded, Abani\u2019s Abani was still a child22.\nThe priest greeted me as I entered the temple. I was a child holding a smaller one: he seemed to guess what had happened. \u201cWhat about your mother?\u201d he asked kindly.\n\u201cI want to leave her here,\u201d I said, ignoring his question.\nHe looked at me sadly. \u201cWill you stay as well?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t have one yet. My father had left us, and my mother did not want his children, not even one. She\u2019d refused to name them, and she\u2019d lacked the courage to kill them. So she\u2019d asked me, begged me to . . .\n\u201cHer name is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJin . . . Jin!\u201d\nI was shaken awake. My anger flared, and I reached for my gun, but it was only the familiar face of Lee Hort\u2014an irritant, to be sure, but perhaps meriting continued life. Besides, if she died, that would be the end of my salary. I withdrew my hand from the gun. \u201cWhat the hell? Can\u2019t I just get a few winks?\u201d\nShe looked nervously at Dar. \u201cI have something to tell you, Jin.\u201d\nI bared my teeth and got up, muttering curses. My voice was low, but the performance was enough to make Lee Hort blanche. She said nothing as she guided me down an empty corridor. Passing Nini and Jilin\u2019s sleeping mat, I saw that the ansible was nearly repaired.\n\u201cWhat is it already?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Dar,\u201d Lee said, biting her lip. \u201cI remembered you have law enforcement powers.\u201d\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\nAfter ten years of frontier chaos, Orchid Autonomous Sector officials had decided they might as well delegate frontier law enforcement to mercenary groups, and assessment to independent mercs. We had the right to arrest, incarcerate, and in extreme cases, execute offenders. Frontier prosecutors (usually merc agency men, or arms dealers) reviewed our handling of cases. Most of the time, the Law Enforcement Proxy Act protected our freedom. Only rarely did one of us overstep, prompting the sector\u2019s government fleet to interfere.\nIn two short years, money, blood, and power had woven a unique network of frontier order. I was a link in the chain. Independent mercs and mercenary captains had the same level of law enforcement power. We were meant to check and balance each other.\n\u201cDar is category A wanted. You have the right to execute him, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOnly in extreme cases, Doc. For example, if he threatened someone with a gun, or tried to escape. But I can\u2019t execute a prisoner that has been arrested. That requires prosecutor level power.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . if an extreme situation unfolded . . . \u201d\nMy eyes narrowed. Her implication was clear. \u201cExtreme situations happen. But that wouldn\u2019t be to my advantage. I don\u2019t like killing, Doc.\u201d\n\u201cI heard your family is in debt. I mean your mother\u2019s family.\u201d\nOf course we were in debt. When Abani was dying, we\u2019d spent a lot trying to save her. All of that money was borrowed.\n\u201cA lot of debt,\u201d I admitted.\n\u201cMaybe I could help with that.\u201d\nI studied her eyes, failing to read her.\n\u201cAre you worried he\u2019ll escape?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t fancy a lifetime of looking over my shoulder.\u201d Lee spoke softly. Every word seemed bitten off and spit out. \u201cHe will find a way to my door, eventually. We were born together. Six children, and two have survived. He will find me, to correct this . . . error.\u201d\n\u201cLiving is not a mistake.\u201d\n\u201cBeing alive at the same time as your litter-mate . . . that\u2019s the mistake. He will kill me. As long as there\u2019s a chance of him escaping, my life is in danger. If I could pray to the Five, I would beg them to . . . \u201d\n\u201cLet him die,\u201d I said.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it like that. It\u2019s so . . . \u201d She turned away and seemed to cry, but she said dry-eyed: \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about that debt. I can help, Jin.\u201d\nThe proposition was clear: blood money. I find a reason to kill Dar, and she pays off the debt. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of money. Close to six hundred thousand, Doc.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nI had few compunctions regarding murder. I\u2019d been a soldier. I\u2019d complied with orders to kill. Later I became a mercenary, and took money for murder. I\u2019d killed for hatred, and simply for fun. I\u2019d probably tried every kind of murder. Death was death. Such a stark outlook would never earn me priestly dispensation, or legal pardon\u2014but here on the frontier, this point of view was the most conducive to survival.\n\u201cThen draft an IOU, Doc.\u201d\nShe raised her brows. \u201cDo you mean to borrow money from me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ll borrow from me.\u201d This was an old way of paying blood money. You needed a pretext, namely a document claiming you had borrowed from the assassin. Then you were just settling accounts.\nLee Hort was wise. She thought for a moment, then showed her understanding with an uneasy smile.\n9\nI didn\u2019t sleep much, contemplating this new deal with Lee. I walked around camp and saw Dar was awake. Hands cuffed with tail behind his back, facing away from the others, he looked uncomfortable and dazed.\nI sat down beside him.\n\u201cNo biscuits this time?\u201d I was surprised he\u2019d spoken first.\nI took out a pack of compressed biscuits for him, unlocked a hand. He devoured the meal. I sat there and did not speak.\nAfter a while he couldn\u2019t help himself: \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cJin.\u201d\n\u201cJust Jin?\u201d\n\u201cYep.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a family?\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cSo, you like to fight alone?\u201d\n\u201cYou bet.\u201d\n\u201cRelic hunter?\u201d\n\u201cMerc, bodyguard, killer . . . I do it all. And what are you?\u201d\n\u201cYou could call me a relic hunter. I also work alone. No one\u2019s brave enough to let me join their family.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m notorious, you understand. I\u2019m sure Lee has told you the story.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t need her to tell me. You\u2019re a household name. Now tell me, really . . . what are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\u201cLee thinks you\u2019re here to kill her.\u201d\nDar chewed some biscuit. For a moment his expression was blank. \u201cShe really thinks I\u2019d do that?\u201d\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you? Never mind what I might or might not believe. This stubbornness gets you nowhere. We\u2019re waiting for a rescue team, and you\u2019re cuffed. Ten years ago you were convicted of murder. How long until you\u2019re shot dead, do you think? You must\u2019ve sought out Lee for a reason. Do you plan on taking it to the grave?\u201d\nHe finally answered with a bitter laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll be shot regardless. Back then I really did light up that fucking temple. But I didn\u2019t kill those children. Not a one.\u201d\nI stared at him.\nAs if an old taboo had finally lifted, he began to talk, voice low and urgent: \u201cThey wanted us to kill each other. I didn\u2019t want to, so I lit a fucking fire. I knew I\u2019d become a wanted criminal, so I fled. I learned about the other children from the news. I burned that temple to save them. Of course I didn\u2019t want them dead. I\u2019ve always wanted to find Lee and tell her what happened, but I never had the chance. I was hunted. I had to run to the edge of the galaxy. Then she graduated from university, and came out here for her research. I thought I finally had my chance. So I watched her, and waited. I came close twice, but both times she found out, and fled. This time wasn\u2019t planned, but I heard about a group of pirates planning a raid here, at Lee\u2019s excavation. I was worried about her, so I came. I wanted to warn her of the danger, tell her I didn\u2019t kill our litter-mates, tell her she needn\u2019t fear me. But she was too afraid.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBefore I could tell her anything, she shot me.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you get hold of the ship\u2019s coordinates?\u201d I asked. It is difficult to find a ship in space, unless there\u2019s a beacon and you know the frequency. Or do what we did: jump right to it through a human portal.\n\u201cThe pirates had your signal data.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cTheir original plan was a pincer attack, blow up the portal, then board the ship from this side and fly off in it. But I asked about their plan, after getting one of them drunk, and got the signal data. I wanted to keep them from getting here, so I shut off your archaeologists\u2019 shipboard signal. Then I shot that ansible. So they can\u2019t find us.\u201d\n\u201cBut now the rescue team can\u2019t find us.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cBetter that than eventually finding corpses.\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah . . . \u201d\nDar smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\u201cWithout some proof, it\u2019s difficult.\u201d\n\u201cAs you please.\u201d He turned to gaze at the great pillar of ecologies. It had been raining in there for days. It seemed it would never stop.\n\u201cI admire the ancient humans,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you know about them?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a mercenary, not an archaeologist. Not even a relic hunter.\u201d\n\u201cThey had one child per birth.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cA human woman could give birth many times, but each time it was just one child.\u201d\n\u201cSo they didn\u2019t have to choose?\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to choose.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . well, I envy them.\u201d\n\u201cMe too.\u201d\n\u201cSo you really know about them.\u201d\n\u201cDoes that surprise you? Relic hunting is the best archaeological university.\u201d\n\u201cLee would certainly disagree.\u201d\nHe gently laughed. \u201cSome say it is precisely because of their lower fertility that they went extinct. After war or famine, they couldn\u2019t replenish their populations.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d\n\u201cThe species that made the Rain Ship? Destroyed by low fertility?\u201d He studied the rain pillar in wonderment. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nWe sat in silence, watched slanting rain lash leaves of grass.\nIt was raining that day. I remember the rain washed the leaves of the fleshy plants clean. They were translucent. When I took the infants out of the basket one by one, raindrops fell on their little closed eyelids. My hands were damp from the mist. Abani once told me an ancient story: she said every raindrop is the soul of a dead child. Those that we abandon at birth, their souls have no names, so after they fly to the heavens, they fall back down and permeate the earth.\nI shook my head, driving away these thoughts. But as I\u2019d tried to tell Lee Hort, we can\u2019t run from our ghosts.\nThe camp was asleep, for the most part. Lee Hort sat with her back to us. The time was right.\n\u201cUp,\u201d I said, unlocking Dar from the pipe. \u201cWe\u2019re going for a walk.\u201d\nHe looked confused but said nothing, following me down a long spiral stair. At the bottom there was a human lift. I turned it on and it seemed to be powering up normally. We descended to the bottom of the spacecraft and looked up from there. At least thirty meters above hung the earthen base of the ecological pillar. The soil was permeated by rainwater, by gurgling veins of it.\nThere must be bones buried in there, I thought. I still remembered digging in the soil with my hands, excavating shallow pits, and one by one placing the little bodies, already silent and unmoving, in the earth.\nI shook my head. I released Dar and shoved him forward. He staggered a few steps, chuckling.\n\u201cShe paid you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d\nI squeezed the trigger.\n10\nBack above, the camp had been awakened by my gun shots. They crowded around and asked what happened.\n\u201cHe picked the lock, and I caught up,\u201d I said. \u201cI fired two shots. He jumped into a tunnel.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of tunnel?\u201d Lee asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. About two meters high, no lights, pitch black. I didn\u2019t follow.\u201d\nLee exchanged a look with her team. I suddenly realized that her relatives knew about the blood money. Of course they did: the vast majority of families pool income. A large expenditure can\u2019t be hidden.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a garbage processor,\u201d said one researcher. \u201cThe humans used it to treat rubbish . . . which gets squeezed, frozen, crushed, and finally airlocked, or put into the pillar as fertilizer.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s still working?\u201d I asked, shivering.\n\u201cThe lift is still in operation, and we\u2019re convinced the spacecraft is getting inexhaustible energy from space folding, so . . . \u201d The researcher grimaced. \u201cWe probably don\u2019t have to worry about that guy. I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t go in, Jin. \u201c\n\u201cBy the Five,\u201d I muttered.\nWhen I\u2019d reassured everyone and they\u2019d returned to their own affairs, I pulled Lee aside and showed her a blood-stained handkerchief. Inside was a crushed bullet.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cI killed him. Shot him in the back of the head. The first bullet is still in there. This one came out through his mouth. This is his blood. Evidence. You can test it.\u201d\nShe looked pale, ready to vomit.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, \u201cbut it\u2019s better this way. I\u2019ll have to make the body disappear, of course, but you need some DNA, so you know you haven\u2019t wasted your money.\u201d\n\u201cI know . . . by the Five . . . \u201d Lee took a deep breath. She put the bullet and handkerchief in her archaeological bag. \u201cWhen we get out of here, I\u2019ll pay you in installments.\u201d\nI watched her. Dar had said he didn\u2019t kill his litter-mates. If that was the truth, then who did it? As I watched her leave, I secretly prayed that I hadn\u2019t made an irreversible mistake.\n11\nObeying Lee\u2019s summons, I arrived in the portal chamber. She looked nervous. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start the portal to see if the pirates are gone. They generally don\u2019t linger after a raid, but . . . \u201d\nThe portal was silent. There was no mirror-glimmer on the surface inside the frame. \u201cSystem checks are normal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s possible they blew up the other side.\u201d\n\u201cTrapping us here,\u201d muttered a young researcher.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an observation ship in the hangar below,\u201d Lee revealed. \u201cWe could take it back to Hill Four. But it only accommodates six people.\u201d\nThere were more than six of us, of course: Lee Hort and her four team members, myself, Nini and Jilin Guer, and my two mercs. Even if we could access Dar\u2019s two-seater, we couldn\u2019t all leave. I frowned, looking around. \u201cWhere are the Guer girls?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Last I saw they were below, working on the ansible.\u201d\nWe searched all over both levels of our home turf, but there was no sign of Nini or Jilin. The repaired ansible was on their rest mat, next to a piece of paper, a nearly illegible note: \u2018Rescue coming in twelve stretches.\u2019\nBut this line had been messily crossed out.\nI squatted to adjust the ansible. This instrument could also monitor spacecraft within the solar system. Most were still concentrated near the Hill Four orbital station. They seemed to be mobilizing for an assist, but Rain Ship was a considerable distance away. Although coming through the portal only took one step, Rain Ship was actually located in Hill system\u2019s encompassing asteroid belt, far from planets and gravity wells, deep in the darkness.\nTo make long-range leaps, ships required boosts from gravity wells. The quickest way to reach us was a jump from Hill Eleven\u2019s well. A twelve-stretch run from Hill Four to us would be quite a rush, but it was possible, barring exigencies.\nBut there were already several spacecraft nearby.\nI brought them up on the holographic display and uttered a curse: three small spacecraft, and a massive barge. No official registration codes. Dar had said these pirates intended to take the Rain Ship. Looked like they wanted to tow it away. A human ship containing ecosystems: I wondered what it would go for on the black market. The pirates were halfway here from Hill Eleven. They\u2019d be upon us in two stretches.\nThe archaeologists crowded around me. My two mercs silently watched the ansible\u2019s light show.\n\u201cDo you intend to surrender, or fight?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cFight,\u201d said one of the mercs, a small fellow with short, black hair. He seemed totally sincere. \u201cI\u2019d rather die than be captured by Northern An barbarians.\u201d\nAs we prepared to resist the pirates, we finally learned what had become of the Guer girls: they\u2019d flown off in Dar\u2019s ship. Lee had been planning to use it as intercepting firepower, so she was furious, unleashing a torrent of curses. The speed and variety of this foul language put my own veteran abilities to shame. I felt I could learn a thing or two from the good Doctor.\n\u201cHey,\u201d I interrupted, \u201cat least they sealed off the bay before they left.\u201d\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know if their seal would hold. They left us here to find out, the shit-digging little bitches!\u201d\nI rolled my eyes and left Dr. Hort cursing endlessly. I traveled to the uppermost cabin on the ship\u2019s hull. After studying Rain Ship\u2019s schematics, I had a plan in mind. I was dealing with three small spaceships, which meant at least twelve people and up to eighteen\u2014not counting the pilots. We were only three mercs and six guns\u2014no, seven. But Dr. Hort\u2019s gun only fired three rounds. Basically useless.\nI explained my plan to the two young mercs. They listened gravely. I didn\u2019t doubt they would implement my plans and follow orders. Although I wasn\u2019t their captain, I had followed some very good senior mercs in my time who, like me, stepped up to fill a leadership vacuum.\nHad they felt like I did now? I was nervous, worried, not knowing if my plan, which would gamble everyone\u2019s lives, would end in victory or disaster.\nBut we had no choice. Which actually made things very simple.\nOn my orders, the two mercs vanished down a corridor. I stayed on the top floor, tossing white coveralls here and there, littering the corridor with archaeological instrument parts and damaged ansible components, so it looked like the area had been evacuated quickly. Looking down from my high vantage, I saw Dr. Hort creating the same effect down near the portal chamber.\nAfter a while, she nervously gestured up at me, signaling that our guests had arrived. Then she disappeared into the shadows. We\u2019d found a massive cabinet in one of the ancient human rooms, big enough to conceal the archaeological team. If we mercs were killed, they might still escape unharmed.\nI slowed my steps, adjusted my breathing, and hid in an adjoining cabin. There were many strange things strewn about in here. Most I couldn\u2019t name, but they were generally solid, suitable for a makeshift bunker.\nNot that I intended to fight in here.\nI was separated from Rain Ship\u2019s airtight fore-compartment by one wall. These pirates\u2019 strategy was clearly superior to Dar\u2019s. They didn\u2019t use explosives, but somehow managed to open this small compartment\u2019s access panel. So, I had been right about their ingress point. We were off to a good start. And now I knew they had at least one expert relic hunter among them\u2014not your run-of-the-mill plunderer, but someone with a high level of ancient human technological knowledge.\nI put my ear to the wall, heard landing gear touch the floor of the compartment. The space was large enough to be used as a docking bay by a Ruderan ship. For the first time I was grateful for ancient human size.\nOne, two, three . . . at five, the sound of their footsteps got too confusing to reckon their number. I waited patiently. Through gaps in my makeshift fort, I watched the armed pirates pass one by one through the airlock.\nThey soon found the junk I\u2019d scattered about. One suggested, in his husky Northern An dialect, that they take the staircase\u2014but at that moment my short black-haired merc ran up quickly from below. He was unarmed, hair disheveled, dressed in the white lab coat of a female lab tech.\nThe pirates pointed at the lower stretch of walkway, shouting excitedly. Rather than taking the stairs, many opted for the more direct route of several archaeologists\u2019 ropes, one by one getting on and sliding down.\nMy luck was simply too good to be true: they left just one man on guard.\nWhen the rest of them had vanished down the walkway, I moved fast and silent. Before the sentry knew what was happening, I had him choke-held, squeezed, quietly dying.\nI didn\u2019t waste time looking down to see how many were still on the taught ropes. I just started cutting. Blood-curdling screams issued from below, one after another, drawn out syllables of terror that ended abruptly. I hurried back to my redoubt, counting fading echoes of screams.\nTruly an auspicious number, thank the Five.\nBelow, the other pirates were shouting curses. I heard several rushing back up the walkway\u2014and exposing themselves in the process.\nI didn\u2019t hear the gunshots, but I heard the thud of heavy objects hitting the walkway deck. No screams meant good marksmanship, headshots. One, two, three\u2014the footfalls grew confused. I caught sight of a figure in white, high up in his hide site, packing away a sniper rifle, then vanishing.\nI didn\u2019t know if the two young mercs could kill the rest of the pirates, but I didn\u2019t waste time thinking about it\u2014gunfire rang out sporadically, mingling with cries and footfalls. A pilot finally emerged from one of the ships, unable to bear what he was hearing, needing to see.\nThis pirate looked frail. I pistol-whipped him in the back of the head. Two minutes later he was tri-cuffed to a shelf frame. Crouching low, I ran through the airlock into the fore compartment.\nLee had suggested we emergency-fuse the airlock, to keep the pirates out, but I\u2019d told her it wouldn\u2019t work. These fellows weren\u2019t stupid. Pirating for long enough teaches you a few tricks, not to mention ruthlessness. They would have blown open the lock, then waited for decompression to kill us all. Besides, we needed their ships to escape.\nThe pilot of the second ship ran down his boarding ramp, gun leveled. I was far away, and my first shot missed. He ducked behind the ramp and started taking pot shots. Then the clever fellow in the third ship decided to be very fucking clever: he initiated the hatch opening sequence, intending to take off.\nI turned and fled, bent low and weaving to avoid any parting shots, but the trigger-happy pilot was also running for it. I made it through the airlock and plunged into the corridor, chasing my breath. My enemy was not so lucky. He was rushing back up his boarding ramp when the hatch opened. Gale-force decompression sucked him into the void.\nI didn\u2019t hear his screams, of course.\nThe third ship lifted off, then came about to face me and the transparent airlock. I stared into its muzzle cannons, wondering how long I had.\nA little moth appeared in the void beyond the hatch.\nIt was Nini and Jilin. I knew it was them\u2014I\u2019d let them take Dar\u2019s ship, after all. And I knew it was Nini who opened fire, and Jilin piloting. They flashed by the open compartment, pouring torrents of plasma into the pirate craft.\nI didn\u2019t bother to watch the outcome.\nBecause a gun was pressed into the back of my neck.\n12\n\u201cBitch.\u201d\nHe had a rough Northern An accent. Just hearing it made me nauseous. I smelled strong sweat and alcohol, and the familiar bouquet of unwashed pirate in old pressure suit. He reached out and took my weapon.\nSlowly I turned around.\nSeeing him for the first time, I knew he was the leader. I couldn\u2019t say why. Maybe it was something in his cloudy eyes, or the crude decorative patterns on his pressure suit\u2014or the frightened sound that issued from the pilot cuffed to the shelf.\n\u201cYour men are dead, bitch.\u201d\nMy gorge rose again.\nI didn\u2019t even know the names of my two mercenaries, but I didn\u2019t think they were dead. Their orders weren\u2019t to fight to the death. If the tide turned, they were supposed to run. Rain Ship was huge, a world unto itself. There were many places to hide, from which to launch guerilla warfare, if necessary. But if they were alive, this bastard was fast and clever.\nI looked around, sizing things up. Quiet. No sign of other pirates.\n\u201cYour people are dead,\u201d I boldly guessed.\nHis lips twisted to reveal his ratty teeth. His fist came out of nowhere, knocking me to the floor. My head buzzed and the world spun. When I could think clearly, I found that he\u2019d dragged me to the topmost bridge leading to the pillar of ecologies.\n\u201cYou\u2019re goin\u2019 down.\u201d He was clearly insane, foaming at the mouth. \u201cI want to see you splatter like mud.\u201d\n\u201cYour family members really made a fuss as they fell.\u201d I was deliberately provoking him. Not a sensible move, but I had no sensible move left. He kicked me hard. I rolled, nearly falling through a gap in the railing and into the abyss.\nBefore I could get up, he rushed over and initiated the beating proper. I tried to protect my head and face, crawling, rolling, gradually approaching the end of the bridge\u2014where it met the pillar of ecologies, and its outer shell of polarized light.\nPunches and kicks rained down on me. Protecting my head, curling up, I gradually left the pain behind and went to a strange place.\nWhy did those ancient giants build these high, perilous bridges? Had they deliberately set up a dramatic venue for suicides? You could jump from the bridge, or you could enter the beauty of the column and then jump. I would have made a morbid archaeological theorist.\n\u201cGet up you wretch.\u201d The pirate leader kicked me again. \u201cTime to die.\u201d\nI laughed hoarsely.\nA second later there was a gun report\u2014a clean shot, the pirate got it in the back of the head. Clearly Lee Hort had learned from experience, not wasting rounds on the pressure suit. Her marksmanship was surprisingly accurate.\nI looked at her, wiping blood from my eye. That bastard had kicked my forehead. I might end up with a scar like Dar\u2019s.\n\u201cNice to see you, Lee,\u201d I said.\nShe did not move, but stared at me with a disturbing focus. She leveled her gun, with a hint of hesitation in this movement.\nWell, I should have guessed. Even with Dar, her three shots had landed near his heart. Only the pressure suit saved him. And the pirates couldn\u2019t have gotten the archaeologists\u2019 beacon data without someone on the inside.\nUnbelievable. How much did you sell to them, Lee? And why did they finally decide to kill you? Did you get too greedy?\nI didn\u2019t say any of that. No, my words had to strike a fatal blow. \u201cYour litter-mates, Lee. Those you murdered, they all have names.\u201d\nShe clenched her jaw, her lady\u2019s gun trembling.\n\u201cDo you know why we don\u2019t name the doomed litter-mates? Because infants with names are tied to earth after they die. They stay with the people who killed them, Lee. They\u2019ve stayed with you.\u201d\nHer face twitched into something like a smile, hideous and sad.\n\u201cDar is still alive,\u201d she said, \u201cI saw him.\u201d\n\u201cSo I have to die?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think, Jin?\u201d\n\u201cDar,\u201d I said, raising my voice, \u201ckill her.\u201d\nLee reacted instinctively, turning to look, and I leapt at her, knocking her to the ground. The gun flew out into the abyss. The two of us wrestled, rolled, tearing and biting, and I took another beating. I hadn\u2019t expected such ferocity and strength.\nWhen I realized we\u2019d rolled to the end of the bridge, an impulse seized me. The gloomy sky above descended, mist and rain like a shroud\u2014\nI grabbed Lee Hort and pulled her with me into the void.\nAnd then I was rolling in wet grass, and I felt rain on my cheeks.\nMy gamble had paid off. No matter how high your entrance into the pillar of ecologies, you will be safely transported to the ground floor. I knew the ancient humans wouldn\u2019t let me down.\nLee Hort was struggling to get up. She was in better shape than me, after all\u2014she hadn\u2019t been beaten by a pirate leader.\n\u201cI\u2019ll . . . kill . . . \u201d\nShe didn\u2019t get to finish this sentiment. She pitched forward, her eyes suddenly wide, then softly closing. Dar was behind her.\n\u201cGood of you to show up,\u201d I managed.\n\u201cOne of your boys was in trouble. I had to help him, so I\u2019m running a little late. You alright?\u201d\n\u201cAbout to fall apart, but I think I can be reassembled.\u201d\nI knew this joke wouldn\u2019t land, but that\u2019s not why he didn\u2019t laugh. He was contemplating the semi-conscious Lee, gripping his gun.\n\u201cNo Dar,\u201d I said, my voice a mere rasp now. \u201cThat\u2019s not you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you back then.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ve changed.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d\nHe was silent for a moment, his cold glare softening. He looked up, taking in his surroundings. \u201cWe\u2019re inside the pillar?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\n\u201cBut how\u2014\u201d\nI joined him in looking around.\nThe pillar of ecologies was big enough from the outside, but the space we were in now was clearly larger. It was like a crystal honeycomb, a space divided into countless six-sided, prismatic worlds. I couldn\u2019t see the limit of the sky, or the edge of the earth.\nFrom where I sat in the grass gazing up, I saw no trace of anything like a spaceship interior\u2014only the small glowing portal by my side. Beyond that was endless space. The edges of polarization plates were visible as dim lines against a far void, each habitat thus vaguely delineated, but somehow I sensed they were permeable. You could walk through them, traveling between ecologies in the pillar\u2014if we were still in a pillar. I put my hand through the nearest plane, and rain continued to fall on my palm.\nAnd then my imagination grew by an order of magnitude. Maybe there were many pillars, comprising their own pillar-space or matrix. Perhaps each pillar contained portals leading to other Rain Ships.\n\u201cThose polarizers . . . \u201d Dar\u2019s voice was hoarse.\n\u201cSubspace partitions,\u201d I amended.\nHe nodded.\nI didn\u2019t really understand this ancient human technology. I knew they had divided subspace, like our scientists do in the lab\u2014though our primitive subspace divisions are no bigger than your finger.\nBut here were countless pillars of subspace, linked by portals, forming a limitless paradise.\n\u201cHow many Rain Ships do you think we\u2019re seeing here?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cDo we have to count?\u201d\nWe were laughing together, and I felt somehow reborn.\nStanding up, I ignored the pain in my back and skull. I walked slowly through the tall grass. I wanted to see more.\nDar stayed with me. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d\n\u201cVisit other Rain Ships.\u201d\nWe approached the portal. It flickered with a weak gray light\u2014but on the far side a very different light was visible: a brilliant white radiance. We couldn\u2019t know what the situation was over there. A vacuum maybe? Or bitter cold, or scorching heat.\nDar supported me, and I didn\u2019t shake off his hand. We entered the portal together.\nThe new ship was about the same size as the last one. The structure was also similar. Some of the instruments were still running, and corridors lit up for us as we entered them. But there was still no sign of the ancient humans. Only their machines remained, ancient, stubborn, and powerful, still running long after their creators\u2019 extinction. We passed through cabins and halls, and finally climbed a windowsill. We stood under the huge porthole, staring in awe at an unfamiliar star-scape.\nI\u2019d never seen such a star: fiery red, blazing, immense. Dazzling, yet dim compared to the blinding, white-hot star behind it. We were in or near the galactic core. The sun-crammed fields were almost too bright to look at.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dar was pointing at a protrusion on the side of the spacecraft.\nI tried to identify the bulge, which resembled a smaller Rain Ship. The hull was translucent, and within there seemed to be an embryonic pillar of ecologies. It clung to the larger ship\u2014no. More like it was gradually breaking away from, growing out of, the larger vessel.\nA birth.\nI touched the ice-cold hull of this Rain Ship, feeling the rough-hewn wall. Everywhere on this ship it was the same dull gray-brown. It had grown up without people, and so hadn\u2019t been painted or finished. Walls and pipes reverberated with circulating machines and liquids, and buzzed with electrical currents. The new Rain Ship was being made in accordance with the parental model, a new life that would not be sacrificed.\nI imagined the primordial epoch when the ancient humans had created these ships, giving them the ability to reproduce, and sending them to every corner of the universe. And yet, their internal subspace ecological pillars were networked. As the ships multiplied, their shared ecological space grew, eventually becoming a vast promised land. Even after the demise of their creators, the Rain Ships continued to grow, waiting endlessly. Cleaving to their original purpose, they continued to fly.\nNo matter how far you go\u2014across star fields, across the universe\u2014the part of the world you love, the part you create, is always with you. If you take one step into a Rain Ship, you can go home.\n0\nA quarter later, we were in the capital of the Orchid Autonomous Sector.\nThe touring prosecutor announced the end of the hearing. In the court\u2019s exit hall, he privately embraced me. Lee Hort and her family had lost their archaeological licenses. They were now in prison.\nDar was there to pick me up. He was using a pseudonym, and he\u2019d grown a beard. No one recognized him. The story of Hort was, like all miserable stories, remembered by everyone.\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d have your law enforcement license revoked,\u201d he quipped.\n\u201cThe prosecutor owes me.\u201d\n\u201cIt must be a great debt.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, pretty big.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t get into the details, and Dar didn\u2019t press me. We stopped in a square, bought two desserts, and ate as we strolled.\n\u201cOld Mortar has returned to work.\u201d\n\u201cHe took two shots in the stomach. I thought he\u2019d rest at least half a month.\u201d\n\u201cFrom a long bitter life we\u2019re on the run, right?\u201d Dar said, smiling.\n\u201cSo you didn\u2019t get your blood money,\u201d he observed.\n\u201cMy financial backer is squatting in prison. And my target is very much alive.\u201d\n\u201cI took a job.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\nI wanted to tell him that he resembled his sister when he was pretending nonchalance. But I didn\u2019t. Some things you can\u2019t say, no matter how evident they are.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be working in Rain Ship space. A city has been discovered, an ancient human city. Everyone\u2019s rushing there. There\u2019s a fellow who\u2019s willing to pay us. Would you come with me? I\u2019m not much of a bodyguard on my own.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019d leave tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem a bit preoccupied.\u201d\nI smiled, licking the ice cream off my hands, and waiting.\nWhen she came by, it was like the whole world lit up. Of course she didn\u2019t notice me. And I didn\u2019t watch her too obviously. We were from different worlds. I wore an old brown military uniform, hair cropped like a man\u2019s. Two guns were stuffed in my jacket. She wore a bright skirt, and she smiled brightly, in high spirits.\nShe approached, passed close by me, and then she was walking away.\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Dar asked.\nI said a name.\n\u201cI thought that was the name on your ID.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t used it for a long time. I gave it to her.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a story I should know?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d\nI got up and walked on, not looking back. In my memory, rain permeated the earth, never ceasing.\nI gave my name to that child. After my father ran away and my mother refused to fulfill her duties, I picked her up and chose her to live. I killed and buried her litter-mates, and sent her to the temple. A good person eventually adopted her, and she had my name. She lived the life I might have.\nThat\u2019s okay, I reckon. In that rain, we all died. She became me, and I became a nameless infant, and ultimately flew away to the stars. I left myself, then discovered the secret of the Rain Ships. I met Dar. This is good\u2014a new sense of meaning, a new destiny.\nDar did not ask about her again. He put his hand on my shoulder, and I felt peace and warmth.\n\u201cTell me about the new job,\u201d I said. \u201cHow much are we getting?\u201d\nHe looked at me and laughed.\nThere\u2019s something about his dark green eyes, but that is another matter entirely.\nEchoes\nI have been watching them grow and develop.\nA young, impulsive, curious, short-lived species, I watch them mature generation by generation, as waves erode the banks of time. Individuals are not significant, and history is transient as a fleeting cloud.\nBut you can still marvel at everything they\u2019ve created, everything they excavate\u2014because their footsteps extend far, because of what they discover, what they believe in, and what they persist in.\nThere are times when you can\u2019t help wanting to write down their stories and record their voices\u2014their loves, hopes, bewilderments, sacrifices, and agonies. I choose to record their most dazzling lifetimes.\nJin died shortly after the end of this story, in a rebellion at the new Rain Ship colony. Dar died with her. They had no time to fall in love. When they died they were still mere acquaintances.\nI got hold of her diary, and I\u2019ve speculated on her thoughts. I\u2019ve written her story from both a human and a Ruderan point of view.\nAt times like this, watching young lives burn out so quickly, I have an impulse. I want to reach out and make contact\u2014gently push one of them this way or that\u2014\nTime can seem to ripple. History can leave vestiges. I know watchmen have made such contact before. Species more ancient than humans, they who watched us before we became the watchers, have done this before.\nThe universe cannot afford such contact. The ancients have warned me.\nBut in the end you will do it anyway, they have prophesied.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, January 2014.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nFootnotes:\n1 - Due to their high birthrates, the Rudera have from the beginning of their civilization enforced strict birth control, allowing just one child per litter to survive. Parents or priests choose the lucky child, and kill the rest. The sacrificed infants are not named, but are generally referred to as \u201clitter-mates\u201d or \u201clink births.\u201d\n2 - Ruderans, intelligent descendants of rats, live at most eight years. They reckon their lives by months. A 100-month lifespan is common and respectable.\n4 - The Gods referred to here are ancient humans. Times change. Nothing lasts forever, including civilizations.\n5 - The Rudera divide a standard day into eight parts or \u2018stretches\u2019, each stretch equal to three hours of human time. Like most rodents, the Rudera sleep in frequent short spells. Their work and leisure are also divided into small pieces. During odd stretches they work. During even stretches they rest, drink, shop, or spend time with their families. As a result, Ruderan work and leisure are closely intertwined.\n6 - Ruderan families are quite different from human families. Men and women do not live together, except during periods of fertility. Families are generally composed of three to five members of the same sex. Male families only accept male members, and female families only take females. Most families carry out joint undertakings, working together. When they move, they move together. When it comes to Ruderans, marriage means entering a family of brothers or sisters, not uniting with someone of the opposite sex.\n7 - Ruderans have only four fingers on each hand, but the tip of a Ruderan tail is divided into three small, dexterous appendages.\n8 - Relic hunters are those who, legally or illegally, take relics from human ruins. Most are armed. There is not much division of labor along gender lines among the Rudera. Women do most things that men do.\n9 - In the Ruderan era, Earth has two major continents: An continent and Mu continent. Northern An refers to a dialect spoken in the Northern part of An, where the inhabitants are known for their ferocity. The Ruderans have become star-faring, but most haven\u2019t joined the Ruderan Galactic Alliance, preferring to raid and rob, drifting between solar systems.\n11 - A net hung from the ceiling and walls of a tunnel for Ruderans to climb. They can\u2019t climb like their ancestors, but are still much better at it than humans.\n12 - Ruderan counting is based on eight. Twenty people in their language is \u201csixteen-four,\u201d but in order to facilitate understanding, the human system is used here.\n14 - A Ruderan is about one-sixteenth the height of a human. This makes harnessing fire difficult. Their custom is to use cold light or bioluminescent moss for illumination. Even now, during their space age, they maintain this tradition.\n15 - A Ruderan unit of length. Ten ta are about 1.03 meters. For ease of understanding, meters are used in subsequent descriptions.\n17 - The first Ruderan handcuffs weren\u2019t much different from the human model. But field tests quickly revealed that upgrading to a three-ring design was necessary. For Ruderans and their dexterous tails, human-style handcuffs aren\u2019t a sensible way to deal with criminals.\n18 - Originally named Church of Biological Truth and Survival of the Fittest, this sect advocates following the survival principle of natural selection. It is rendered \u201cExtreme Darwinism\u201d for ease of understanding.\n19 - The Ruderan lifespan is short. Growth and development are fast. Age ten here means ten months old.\n21 - Compared to the common bell used by humans, an inverted bell placed on the ground is better for propagating sound in an underground city.\n22 - \u2018Abani\u2019 is the title of the eldest female in a family. Similar to the human \u2018great-grandmother.\u2019\n23 - A \u2018binary\u2019 is simply two Ruderan stretches, a work stretch plus a leisure stretch considered as one unit.\n24 - The Rudera believe that five is a holy number, and good luck. This is because five is the first number a Ruderan needs both hands to count to. (Ruderans have only four fingers per hand.)\n25 - This is a limerick handed down among mercenaries. It goes, \u201cFrom a long bitter life we\u2019re on the run! Fuck the enemy\u2019s mom with your big gun! What good is wealth to a diseased old fart? Let\u2019s die young tearing enemies apart!\u201d As a female, Jin obviously doesn\u2019t like the second line.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

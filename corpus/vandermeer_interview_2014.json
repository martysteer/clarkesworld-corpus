The series has been featured on the front page of the New York Times as an example of an accelerated publishing schedule, also known as \u201cbinge reading\u201d and spotlighted by Entertainment Weekly, among many many others.\nThe trilogy chronicles the attempts of the secret government agency known as the Southern Reach to uncover the mystery behind Area X, a pristine wilderness existing behind an invisible border, cut off from the rest of the world for over thirty years. The first two books are already out and Acceptance will be published on September 2nd.\nIn April, VanderMeer attended the Arkansas Book Festival and participated in a Q&A with Ben Fry at the Witt Stephens Jr. Central Arkansas Nature Center. Fry has served as General Manager of KLRE & KUAR Public Radio in Little Rock, Arkansas, since 1995. He also serves as an adjunct professor in the School of Mass Communication at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, teaching film classes. This transcript of their conversation has been slightly abridged.\nJeff, can you talk a little bit about the beginnings of this book, how the idea came to you, and whether you were thinking of a trilogy when it first came about?\nThe very basic idea came to me actually in a nightmare. I was very sick with bronchitis, and one night I had this nightmare where I was walking down into a tunnel, and as I walked into the tunnel, I saw these living words written in some living material on the walls, and they were getting fresher as I went farther and farther down, which meant whatever was writing them was actually down there as well. At a certain point, I saw kind of a weird light, and I knew if I turned the corner, I would actually see whatever was down there. At that point, I think it was that my writer brain decided to airlift me out, because if I\u2019d seen whatever was there, I wouldn\u2019t have written the story.\nThere were some precursors to this. I had wanted to write about the Florida Wilderness in some form for a long time, and so I had that in the back of my head. There had also been the Gulf oil spill, which at the time had been this horrible unending experience where hiking in that coastal wilderness, knowing the threat to it, and having to sit there every day not being able to do anything about it, the oil was just, and all of our heads in that area was just basically continually spilling and spilling and spilling. On some level, I think that also affected my subconscious just coming up with something like Area X to some degree, a total transformation, obviously, of the situation, but I still think that was a bit of a catalyst.\nHave you always been inspired by dreams? My experience with that is I have this fantastic dream. I go, \u201cThis is a great story.\u201d I wake up, and it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\nYes, I have tons of dreams. I had a dream about a giant armadillo that was terrorizing Tallahassee where I live. That did not become anything, not even a story. Usually, when I have a dream, it doesn\u2019t become a story, but when characters and situations and a plot begin accrete around it, then it works. I do have a strong belief in the subconscious. There\u2019re many times working on a book where when I go to bed, I say, \u201cOkay, subconscious, this is the problem I\u2019m working on. I want a solution in the morning.\u201d That actually works.\nCould you talk a little bit more about St. Marks, the wildlife refuge and your hikes there.\nI hike out to St. Marks, which is in the [Florida] Panhandle, and there\u2019s a trail out there that\u2019s about fourteen miles, and it\u2019s a great trail to do because it goes from your standard pine forest to cypress swamp, and it goes from that to salt marsh and then from there out to the sea, and so you have all of these different environments back-to-back. It\u2019s fairly unique. You can\u2019t find a whole lot of places like that in the United States with that particular type of environment.\nYou see all kinds of things out there. The dolphins will come into the freshwater canals at high tide chasing fish, and they\u2019ve adapted to the brackish water there, so you\u2019ll be out there hiking, and the first time I saw this, it just kind of blew my mind, because you\u2019re not expecting a dolphin. You kind of think you\u2019re in a dolphin-free zone, and suddenly you\u2019re not.\nIt\u2019s like the first time I was in Australia and I saw a kangaroo, a flash of brown come out of the underbrush, it\u2019s the same thing because I was used to flashes of brown meaning a deer. You see things like that that are natural to the area, but they seem really strange if you don\u2019t live there and experience them a few times.\nSo sometimes I get reactions to the books where people are reacting to things that actually happened in the wilderness, but they\u2019re not accustomed to that area of the wilderness, or they don\u2019t go hiking a lot, and so the books are even stranger for them than they are for other people.\nI did actually once thought I saw a kangaroo out [at St. Marks, too] which I know couldn\u2019t have been a kangaroo, but I was with someone who was saying, \u201cLook, there\u2019s an alligator over there,\u201d and so I saw this \u201ckangaroo\u201d out of the corner of my eye, turned to look at the alligator, and [when I tried to find the kangaroo again], it wasn\u2019t there anymore. I\u2019ll never know what it was.\nI did encounter a Florida panther out there. It\u2019s an unconfirmed sighting because I was there by myself, and I didn\u2019t take a picture, but there are no other cats that large with tails in Florida. That was something.\nIs that an important part of writing these novels, the environment? Is that important to you, natural settings?\nYeah, it really is. This is just the first time I\u2019ve really had an opportunity to engage at length with it to some degree. Before, most of my novels have been set in cities, so it\u2019s been obviously a more urban environment. It\u2019s been really kind of satisfying to really write about the place that\u2019s closest to my heart, that I really feel is home.\nWhen I was a child, we traveled around so much I didn\u2019t really have a place that I could write about, like Stephen King writes about Maine. After close to twenty years hiking at St. Marks, I really feel close to it, and I feel comfortable with it. That\u2019s one reason why I could write the novel so quickly: the whole landscape is basically the fourteen-mile hike, including the lighthouse.\nIn fact, when I finished it, I handed it to my wife, and I said, \u201cI think I just wrote something incomprehensible about four women wandering aimlessly on a hiking trail in North Florida. Could you please check for me?\u201d She read it and thankfully gave it the stamp of approval and said it was actually a novel and actually made sense.\nThen in Authority, which is set in kind of like small towns in part and the secret agency, it gave me an opportunity to show wildlife kind of interacting in that context and the way that we, even in small towns and whatnot, we encounter animals. A slightly more urban setting. We still are interacting with our environment in an interesting way.\nWhen I was reading Annihilation, there was this point where I really felt like I couldn\u2019t trust anything that anybody said, including the narrator . . . I even started to wonder whether what she was telling me was happening was authentic or not. Is that intentional?\nYeah, it is intentional that this novel destabilizes you section by section. You think you\u2019re reading one kind of novel. Then you think you\u2019re reading another kind of novel. Then you just slowly kind of descend into this world where you\u2019re having to yourself analyze what\u2019s going on and say, \u201cIs this accurate? Is this not accurate?\u201d You kind of descend into the paranoia because you get a sense, I think, pretty early on, so it\u2019s not a spoiler, that the agency that\u2019s sending them in is pretty paranoid itself and hasn\u2019t told them everything like the excerpt that I read.\nYou have that. Then you have whatever is in Area X being a really good mimic and at times throwing back things at you that it thinks you want to see. If the biologist is inaccurate, it\u2019s because she\u2019s being misled. I think she\u2019s not so much an unreliable narrator as somebody who doesn\u2019t want to tell you everything at the time you want to hear it. Everything she says is accurate up to a point. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s not telling everything.\nEspecially in the third book, you learn a lot more about her too and get a better sense of maybe peculiarities of her character you don\u2019t know about in book one, and also by book three, a lot of the conversations that occur in Annihilation take on a different light because you know a lot more about those other characters on the expedition with her, because some of the other two books go back into the past a little bit.\nThere\u2019s a style in it too that I think you do which is the characters hold back information. In Authority, I noticed that sometimes I would think that there would be an incident that will happen, and I will think it\u2019s all over with, and then a few pages later, you come back, and you hear there was something really important that happened in that incident that wasn\u2019t explained at that time. What\u2019s your intention with that?[In part because the main character is trying to analyze everything and put it into a context first, and also because the point at which some things happen to the main character isn\u2019t the point of maximum tension\u2014it\u2019s when he has to report back to his superiors. But] there\u2019s also a real practical reason why [for some of] those gaps, so I can\u2019t really address that. With the biologist, she\u2019s very concerned about being seen as objective and not being judged by certain things, so her agenda when she sets out this journal account, which is written . . . it\u2019s not really in the moment of what\u2019s happening but a little bit afterwards . . . she\u2019s very concerned about that, and so there\u2019s certain things she doesn\u2019t want to let you know, because she wants you to have other information first. I also think she\u2019s kind of a reticent person anyway, somebody who kind of interacts with the wilderness a lot more than she does with other people or has more of an affinity for so . . .\nThe first novel\u2019s first person, the second novel is third person. Did you think at some point about writing the second novel in first person?\nNo, I pretty much always knew the second novel was going to be third person. It was from the point of view of a new director taking over the Southern Reach, the secret agency, and I always knew that it was better for me to do that in third person.\nSomehow, my way into his character was third person, not first person, maybe because I think that if you\u2019re new coming into the situation, you can already feel a little overwhelmed, and being so close as first person to that character probably would\u2019ve meant it would be very difficult to get a sense of what\u2019s going on around him, and so I wanted a little bit of separation from him, even though I\u2019m very interior on his thoughts, to be able to kind of show the wider view of things.\nIn the third book, I use first, second, and third for different character points of view. Something that really annoys me with multiple character novels is when they use all first person. It\u2019s really hard to make those differentiated, and if you use too many third person points of view, then the same problem can occur, just not as giant. Using the mix of the three makes them really stand out from one another, because the second person one is set in the past.\nDid they get progressively longer. Is Acceptance a lot longer than Authority?\nThe second one is ninety-three thousand words, and the third one is about ninety-one thousand. Almost twice [the length of Annihilation], and they\u2019re all very complete, separate novels. There\u2019s parts of the third one you probably can\u2019t read without reading the first two, but the first two you can read independent of one another. You could conceivable read Authority first and then read Annihilation. It would be a different reading experience, but the reveals and the mysteries are so different in what\u2019s happening that you wouldn\u2019t have any spoilers, one from the other really.\nI think Annihilation works all alone too. You don\u2019t necessary have to know all the things that you\u2019re going to find out in the next novels.\nThat\u2019s correct, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re not this A to B to C bunch of reveals because it\u2019s actually been really rewarding to me, because I like ambiguity quite a bit, to have a certain number of readers saying, \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know what happens next. There\u2019s enough in this for me.\u201d Then, of course, there\u2019re readers who say, \u201cI need to know what these mysteries.\u201d I think I struck a balance between those two groups. It\u2019ll be probably enough for them to both hate me by the end of the series. [Laughing]\nSeriously, Authority is an exploration of authority as well as a continuation of the story. It is its own separate character arc. It is about this secret agency. It\u2019s an expedition into it the same way that Annihilation\u2019s an expedition into Area X, and then the third book has its own set of themes and concerns.\nReveals are like ten to twenty sentences a book, and then there\u2019s all the rest of it [remaining to write]. Conceivably, I could\u2019ve written book one and done a couple Twitter messages and been done, I suppose, but there were some other things I wanted to explore, and I really wanted to explore these characters from different points of view. Even by the end of the second book, you have a different view of the psychologist, who\u2019s on the expedition in the first book, for example.\nThe publishing experience was different for you from what you have been used to. Would you talk a little bit about that?\nYeah, it was quite interesting. Up until this point, I\u2019d been writing books that were set in imaginary worlds. They were published by science fiction fantasy publishers here in the US. Sometimes they were published by mainstream publishers overseas. On this one, it was the exact reverse. We had several offers from literary mainstream imprints and very little interest from genre imprints, and I still don\u2019t know why that was. I was kind of concerned until the books came out, and does this mean it\u2019s not going to connect with a certain segment of readers?\nBut so far, these are probably my best-selling books ever. I think the schedule that they\u2019re on of releasing all three in the same year has been really helpful too in terms of sometimes you\u2019ll have the second book come out a year later, and even if people really loved the first book, there\u2019s this resistance to it, or they have forgotten certain parts, and so there was also less need for me to kind of recap things at the beginning of the second book that there would\u2019ve been otherwise.\nThe only thing about the fact that they\u2019re putting them out back to back is I think I\u2019m probably going to be dead by the end because I\u2019ve been on the road more or less continuously except for some breaks from February 4th through now, and then I get two months off, and then I go back on the road from the end of June to the end of the year.\nI get a year off after this, and after living like a hermit for two years, I get to be on the road and learn how to talk to people again, which has been fascinating as well.\nWhich one do you like better, the hermit or road warrior.\nThe hermit because I love to write, but I do love being out on the road. Now, I schedule some extra time to go walking around the wilderness. I enjoy meeting people, but every once in a while, at a certain point I have to kind of retreat and get some writing time in. There\u2019s kind of an itch there where if I don\u2019t write for a very long time, I get kind of twitchy. Luckily you\u2019re not encountering me when I\u2019m twitchy.\nAudience: What about you doing the screenplay for the movie?\nThat\u2019s a very good question. Because it\u2019s a first person narrative and film is third person, they\u2019re going to have to make radical changes anyway to make the first movie, so I don\u2019t really have a problem with someone else doing the screenplay. If it was somebody other than Scott Rudin Productions, maybe I would have a problem.\nWell, thinking about the film, are there things that you are concerned about?\nI\u2019m concerned about a few things. These are not four white women running round in Annihilation, as you learn in the second book. They\u2019re also not a bunch of men, and my concern would be that they would change the gender of the characters or something like that. I\u2019m less concerned on the diversity issue because it\u2019s more about getting the right actor. [Regina King] who was on Southland who I think would be perfect to play the biologist, even though you learn the biologist is not African-American in the second book. It\u2019s more getting the mix right, getting the right actresses, sticking with women for that expedition. Those would be my main concerns would be casting concerns.\nIn fact, that\u2019s what I was thinking about. I would hate to see them change the female expedition because we\u2019ve got to have a guy in there. There\u2019s a tendency to do that with a science fiction thriller, to not have it all be led by women. That concerned me too.\nI read somewhere recently that a lot of the top blockbusters have had female leads, so maybe that\u2019s changing.\nYour parents, growing up in Fiji, what kind of influences has that had on your writing over the years?\nThere\u2019s a scene in Annihilation where she goes out at night, and she finds this glowing starfish. This is actually something that happened to me when I was in Fiji at like the age of six or seven. We were out on the reef at night, and . . . at a certain point I had no idea where the heck I was and which way land was or anything else. I could kind of see flashlights in the distance, and I came across this Crown-of-Thorns starfish, which does kind of have a phosphorescence at night. It kind of acclimated me to exactly where I was.\nOther than that, I haven\u2019t been able to write about Fiji, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I was so young when I was there or because being embedded in another culture doesn\u2019t really mean you become an expert on where you are. Definitely, it was an influence because instead of taking raises or sometimes pay, what they did is they took travel vouchers and at the age of, I think, I was eight or nine when we came back from the Peace Corps from Fiji, we spent nine months traveling around the world, mostly Southeast Asia and Africa and places like that, and it was the perfect age for me to soak up a lot of it and, of course, have an influence on my fiction and how I think about fiction in general.\nYour parents, I think, somewhat show up in the books.\nThey do a little bit. They\u2019re kind of transformed. They appeared a little bit more in my prior novels. My dad\u2019s an ant scientist. He\u2019s a research chemist with the USDA working on fire ants. My mom\u2019s a biological illustrator and currently studying French graveyard art for another Ph.D. over in France. In fact, she once got caught in a graveyard after hours and was detained by the police and then emailed me and said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how many weird people there are in this graveyard after midnight.\u201d I was like, \u201cYes, mom, you were there.\u201d\nHow important is research in your writing? In this particular, in the first book, Annihilation, you\u2019ve got a biologist and a psychiatrist. You\u2019ve got all these scientists. How important is it for you to kind of know where they\u2019re coming from?\nEven though my dad\u2019s an \u201cant scientist,\u201d he has interaction with other kinds of scientists, and there are certain things that are common across in terms of scientific theory and pursuit. That I already kind of had down, and then I did do some research. I always wanted to be a marine biologist until I discovered I didn\u2019t really want to study biology\u2014I just wanted to look in tidal pools\u2014and so I had some background there.\nI also had the idea that the biologist is not the world\u2019s best biologist. I mean, you notice in the book that she gets fired from an awful lot of jobs. I used that in part because I didn\u2019t want to over-research it and then kill the spontaneity of the book with too much of that. There\u2019re actions that she takes that are not really by the book that wind up being important to the plot in the second and the third book.\nYou know, you also write things that kind of take place in imaginary cities and involve history. Do you spend a lot of time researching that sort of thing?\nFor the prior books, I studied pretty much all of Byzantine history. I must have read twenty to thirty books on Byzantine history and Venetian history. There\u2019re some really weird things in there\u2014like you find out that the Visigoths made cloaks from the pelts of field mice and that the leaders who had the most power had the most field mouse pelts in their cloaks. That sounds very powerful. [Laughter]\nFor the Southern Reach novels, it was more the sense of place that was really important, and so I reached this point in writing where I knew I needed to have a different environment because at some point one of the characters leaves the South basically, and I was a little bit frantic about that because everything in the books that\u2019s about the South is something that I\u2019ve seen, observed, know the texture of, and I didn\u2019t want a single received research detail in there.\nSo my wife and I actually took two weeks off to just go up the coast of California as basically a research trip, and what I was doing was collecting textures and smells and scents and talking to people. You can\u2019t feel like you live there obviously if you\u2019ve only been there for that amount of time, but in terms of the actual landscape, you can pick up enough detail, enough sense of it, that you\u2019re not giving reader received secondhand information.\nAudience: What did you study in college?\nWell, I went to the University of Florida, and I took some creative writing classes. I started out as a journalism major and then went to English with a Latin American History minor, and then by the second year I pretty much I knew I didn\u2019t really feel like graduating. I know that sounds weird, so I just took every class I wanted to take that I hadn\u2019t taken because the poet Richard Wilbur had come through a couple of years before, and he basically said don\u2019t get a creative writing degree\u2014just take as many different courses as possible. Learn as much as possible, soak everything in.\nAt that point, I just had lost focus because I didn\u2019t want to become a teacher or journalist. I just wanted to write fiction. I dropped out halfway through my senior year, and I got a tech writing job, and then I just wrote on the side until I could become a full-time writer. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily advise that as a path. It\u2019s just what happened to me. It\u2019s very difficult when you go in thinking you want to do one thing and then you realize it doesn\u2019t really matter what you do because all you want to do is write fiction. That\u2019s very destabilizing when you\u2019re in a situation where you need to have discipline.\nAudience: Do you have a good idea about the characters\u2019 names and who they are and where they are? Since there are no names in Annihilation and you don\u2019t know exactly where in the world it\u2019s set.\nIn Authority, you get a better idea of most of them. You get some names. You may never get a name for the biologist; I\u2019m not telling. And you get more of a sense of place, very specific. Like, the Southern Reach building in Authority is based on a combination of really crappy 1970s concrete government buildings in the United States and like the worst possible Soviet architectural disasters, so it\u2019s this kind of U that has all these weird baffle issues and all these gutter issues. I had a lot of fun with that where actually, for the second novel, I have a diagram of the building and how everything matches up.\nWe mentioned that the story has a kind of espionage thing going on. What was your inspiration for that?\nI\u2019m a huge John Le Carre fan. I think he is a brilliant writer, and for some reason\u2014and this doesn\u2019t lessen the accomplishment\u2014in his best novels, I think he\u2019s just an absolutely master of the art and craft of writing, but because they\u2019re espionage novels and therefore they have this particular focus, it\u2019s easier to see how he uses craft than in some mainstream literary novels that are not in a particular genre. Even though, like I said, I think he\u2019s absolutely a master of that.\nI love the interiority of some of his characters, the way that he makes all his characters incredible lived-in, and you just see everything from their perspective in such an interesting way and how they get involved in these very intricate puzzles. I\u2019ve taken a lot of craft lessons from reading Le Carre\u2019s books, and I wanted to do kind of a deconstructed spy story mixed with kind of a horror story.\nYou\u2019ve mentioned your wife a couple of times. I know you edit anthologies together. What\u2019s the working relationship like.\nIt didn\u2019t start out very well. We met because she came down to Gainesville where I was organizing some literary events, and she was asking for advice about her magazine, which she just started. I promptly then sent her a story. This was very early in my career. It was a terrible story about a talking magic frog going to the prom, and I don\u2019t even . . . I mean, it was really, really early in my career.\nShe rejected it, and then I sent her a letter back saying that I was glad she rejected it. It had been a test to see if she was a good editor. [Laughter] Which it had not been. It was just a crappy story that I had not recognized was a crappy story. Our relationship built on that. As most relationships do.\nFor a long time, we kept our editing separate because we wanted to have separate identities, and we were both afraid, just because of sexism in the field, that if we combined forces everything would be about me. Then eventually, it made no sense because she was helping on all the projects I was doing, and I was helping on all the projects she was doing, so we combined forces, and now we\u2019ve edited all these anthologies together, and it\u2019s proven very good.\nI\u2019m a good skimmer if that makes any sense, on these anthologies. I will go on ahead like a golden retriever bringing back interesting stuff, and she will tell me, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t actually very interesting at all,\u201d or \u201cThis was.\u201d She\u2019s the more in-depth reader for the anthology. She\u2019s also a very good general editor, and I\u2019m more about the line edits and getting into the manuscript, and so we work very well in that regard.\nAfter the third novel comes out and you\u2019ve finished your travels where do you go from there? I know you\u2019re not going to think about writing fiction for a year, right?\nRight. Well, I\u2019m working on editing for our own press an omnibus of a really interesting Finnish writer, Leena Krohn, a nine hundred-page volume of her work. I think she\u2019s an amazing fantasy writer who\u2019s very underappreciated, and my hope is that when all of these reviewers get this doorstop of a book, there\u2019s absolutely no way that they can ignore her work.\nI\u2019m also working on something called The Book Murderer, which I meant to be the last novel I ever wrote but probably will be the next one, which is a sendup of all aspects of book culture. From publishing to reviewers to everything, every aspect of it, literary festivals. This festival nothing weird has happened, so I have no material.\nWell, yeah, it\u2019s not over yet.\nHa! Yes, and, you know, the book addresses issues like blurbing. Blurbing can be a very kind of incestuous thing where you blurb somebody, and then they ask you for a blurb, and so there\u2019s a section in The Book Murderer where he does a rant on his blog about blurbers, and the whole incestuous nature is completely over the top. The reason I know this might get me in trouble is I posted on my blog just as an experiment to see how people would react, and I got so much hate mail from this thing that was meant to be a parody or a satire.\nThank you very much.\nThank you. Thank you for some great questions."}

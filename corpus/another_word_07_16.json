No critique, no crunchy science, none of the stuff I push on my blog or Nowa Fantastyka. \u201dAnother Word\u201d serves exclusively as a showcase for essays \u201ctied closely to your professional involvement in the community.\u201d\n Ew.\n I\u2019m not big on \u201cthe community.\u201d I\u2019m not even sure such a thing exists. I know a lot of terrific people working in the shadow of this genre, in any number of capacities\u2014but when you stir them in with everyone else who ever dogged a con, all those varied ingredients always seem to separate out into immiscible globules that can\u2019t stand the sight of each other. You know the tribes. You know the names. You\u2019d have to be blind not to see the fracture lines webbing across the landscape. Calling such disparate factions a community is a little like saying \u201cUnited States of America\u201d without putting ironic air quotes around the first word. Sometimes I think the best way to deal with them all is to just keep a safe distance while they tear each other to shreds.\n And yet I can\u2019t. No author can. We feed on each other, after all. We write, you read, enough money changes hands to keep the cycle rolling (although most of us are so addicted to writing we\u2019d do it anyway, a design flaw that unscrupulous publishers have used against us for generations). An author could spend their whole life steering clear of cons and book signings and they\u2019d still be bound to the community like a vein to an artery. So Daniel Abraham talks about receding horizons of success in the writing biz; Margot Atwell points us to new markets opened up by online and e-book publishing; Ken Liu waxes about the benefits of laziness and the dawning age of computer-assisted storytelling.\n How to do stuff, in other words. How to maximize your odds of success: what fresh markets to explore, what tech to embrace, what habits to cultivate. And these insights, in turn, comprise the merest fraction of a vast and ever-growing archive of Received Wisdom from the Elders: the Clarion calls, the self-help books, the beta readers and writing groups and university courses taught by bitter Humanities profs who never made it out of the small presses.\n There\u2019s a lot of it out there, whole libraries of the stuff. And yet when I sift through it in search of something useful to say I come up empty\u2014because I never did most of those things, and when I did I usually sucked at them. I did pretty much everything wrong.\n I think I still do.\n You know the list. Write every day. Blog every two or three, lest your fans grow bored and wander back to Buzzfeed. Join SFWA. Schmooze every editor. Infest every social media platform you can find, promote yourself relentlessly every time you so much as publish a laundry list. (I know of one agent who refused to represent an absolutely brilliant author solely because said author wasn\u2019t on Twitter. The agent didn\u2019t even bother to read the work in question; I mean, how great can you be if you don\u2019t talk nonstop about how great you are?) Never badmouth your publisher, certainly not in public; you\u2019ll be painted as a diva and a troublemaker and you\u2019ll never eat in this town again.\n Me? I\u2019m lucky if I have time to blog once a week. I don\u2019t twit, never have; I\u2019m not on any social platform except Facebook, and the only reason I\u2019m there is because I got sick of people saying hey did you read what that guy said about you on Facebook without being able to check it out. (That\u2019s one habit I do share with every author on the planet; we ego-surf almost as much as we masturbate.) I managed to stick it out in the SFWA sandbox for maybe a year before fleeing in horror. I couldn\u2019t schmooze if my life depended on it; back in \u201904 I nearly got into a fistfight escaping from a friend who, in the misguided belief that I needed to \u201cnetwork,\u201d was physically dragging me across the room to meet Gardner Dozois. I\u2019m not even above badmouthing publishers, if they deserve it and if backstage efforts get me nowhere (just last January I apparently badmouthed a publisher without even meaning to). According to Received Wisdom, I starved to death in 2005.\n Hell, the most basic rule of the game is get paid for your work, and I don\u2019t even do that very well; I started giving Blindsight away for free online (along with most of my backlist) just a couple of months after its hardcover release. That incredibly stupid, bridge-burning act turned out to be the smartest move I ever made. If not for the publicity it generated (by people with far bigger names than mine\u2014Scalzi, Doctorow, Cramer, others to whom I will always be in debt) Blindsight would have sunk without a trace, and me with it.\n Just to be clear: you\u2019re not witnessing any kind of principled nobility here. Rather, you\u2019re dealing with an ego so fragile it\u2019s more afraid of looking needy than it is of commercial failure. I crave fame and riches as much as anyone else on the midlist\u2014I just don\u2019t want to be that person who trumpets their own eligibility at the top of every awards season, who puts out a goddamn press release every time they get a story published in Prairie Fire. You can\u2019t blame anyone for doing that, of course. We\u2019re told to do that, we\u2019re blamed if we don\u2019t do it: by agents, by self-help books, by publishers who take more and more for less and less in the desperate hope that\u2014if they squeeze their authors just a little harder\u2014they might get out from under Amazon\u2019s boot. But even if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s never pretty. Every time I see a panelist introducing themselves by spreading their backlist across the table, I die a little inside.\n Fortunately, I haven\u2019t had to do much of that stuff myself\u2014because while I may not have much stomach for self-pimpery, I was once lucky enough to get shit-kicked and jailed by a cadre of unhinged border guards down in Michigan. I was even luckier to nearly die of flesh-eating disease the very next year (on Darwin Day, believe it or not). The year after that first incident, I won a Hugo. A few months after the second, I won the Shirley Jackson (for a story that debuted right here in Clarkesworld, in fact). Over in Poland, one night in 2011, I set my thumb on fire (it\u2019s actually a thing they do there at parties), and I\u2019ve lost count of the accolades I\u2019ve received from those guys over the years.\n I don\u2019t know whether I deserved any of these wins. I like to think so\u2014but then again, I\u2019ve seen the visitor spikes on my website. The timing is suggestive\u2014I just happen to win the Jackson right after uploaded pictures of the Australia-sized hole in my leg inspires half the internet to toss their cookies?\u2014and it\u2019s not as though anyone seriously believes that there\u2019s no correlation between publicity and awards. (Noting that correlation, I started stepping blindly into traffic after Echopraxia came out. Sadly, the only award that book won was some obscure bauble called the \u201cBookie,\u201d from the CBC. Maybe because I never actually got run over.)\n My point is there are a lot of ways to get noticed. The best, in my experience, are those where you don\u2019t even realize you\u2019ve committed an act of self-promotion until after the fact. (I\u2019m flashing back to an elevator ride in the Port Huron courthouse, just after my sentencing, when the scary-looking dude behind me sized me up and said \u201cI don\u2019t know if you just set this whole thing up to get new readers, but I went online the other day and found this story you wrote. I think it was called The Things...?\u201d) You don\u2019t have to embarrass yourself at parties or pimp yourself on Twitter or hack your own finished novel into pieces, only to stitch it back together into something your publisher can sell as Young Adult. (Yes, I know people who have done this.) You don\u2019t even have to be especially good at prose; the bestseller lists are infested with people who can barely write their way out of a fortune cookie.\n And I haven\u2019t even mentioned self-publishing.\n This would be the point where I bring it all home with my own set of rules, my own path to success. But I can\u2019t. You\u2019d be crazy to follow my example: it was more accident than design, there were too many flukes and butterflies flapping their wings along the way. Only an idiot would list \u201cnearly succumb to weird space disease\u201d on their twelve-step plan for literary success.\n But the thing is, it wasn\u2019t just a fluke (or a bacterium, or a beat-down) here and there. I did everything wrong, things that should have sunk my career half a dozen times. I\u2019m nowhere near bestseller status and I doubt I ever will be, but I\u2019m still standing, published in nineteen languages. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d describe it as success. There\u2019s no security in this job; for all I know everything\u2019s going to come crashing down tomorrow. Maybe I\u2019m Wile E. Coyote two seconds before he looks down and realizes there\u2019s no ground beneath his feet, but I\u2019m making a living at this, for now at least. I\u2019ve been making a living at it for most of this century. If this is success, then I achieved it by failing at pretty much every benchmark that\u2019s supposed to matter.\n The only thing I can conclude from that\u2014the closest thing to advice I can offer\u2014is that Rules matter a lot less than anyone told us. They\u2019re statistical descriptors at best, curves, and confidence limits designed to reduce a million data points down to a few manageable parameters. They\u2019re next to useless when it comes to predicting the trajectory of a single point.\n There are a million points in this cloud. There have to be a million trajectories.\n Surely that\u2019s cause for hope.\n Length-of-rejection (used as an index of editorial interest) from Analog, over time. Empirical support for the claim that my writing gets worse with practice.\n Peter Watts\u2014author of Blindsight, Echopraxia, and the Rifters Trilogy, among other things\u2014seems especially popular among people who don't know him. At least, he wins most of his awards overseas except for a Hugo (won thanks to fan outrage over an altercation with Homeland Security) a Jackson (won thanks to fan sympathy over nearly dying from flesh-eating disease), and a couple of dick-ass Canadian awards you've probably never heard of. Blindsight is a core text for university courses ranging from Philosophy to Neuropsychology, despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires. Watts's work is available in nineteen languages."}

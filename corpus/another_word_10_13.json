It\u2019s a gorgeous, twisty little noir that manages to co-opt all the expectations of the genre and do something just a little different with all of them. In particular, there\u2019s a scene where Jeff Daniels\u2019 blind protector-figure Lewis sits down with love interest Luvlee played by Isla Fisher. He tells her the story of how he lost his sight, and ties his experience back into hers with a simple, telling question: What are you doing here?\nWhen I was starting out as a professional writer, with a few stories here and there and working on a novel that might be publishable, I spent a lot of time talking to people who were further along in the business than I was. I asked one question of accomplished writers\u2014\u201cWhat is your ambition?\u201d It was my own way of phrasing the idea \u201cwhat are you doing here?\u201d The answers I got never quite satisfied me.\nSome folks wanted to win awards, some wanted to be taught a part of the modern literary canon, some wanted to be New York Times bestsellers. They told me about some things that people thought would be cool, things that would be genuinely gratifying to the ego. Maybe that was what they heard when I asked the question. Looking back, I don\u2019t think that was what I meant, but it\u2019s possible the question I was trying to ask doesn\u2019t fit so well into casual conversation.\nAnyone who dedicates a large chunk of their life to the pursuit of a massive and at least partly self-defined project\u2014writing novels, dog agility, martial arts, building robots in the garage, programming, whatever\u2014has something very interesting happening to them.\nOften, when we don\u2019t make money from them, we call these hobbies, but I have to say I really dislike that word. It has too many nuances of frivolity and fecklessness. I prefer fetishist. It\u2019s also inaccurate, but it captures the idea of excitement and obsession and transgression in a way that seems more nearly true.\nIn a culture that is most comfortable defining us\u2014you and me and all the rest\u2014in terms of workers and consumers, the idea of someone throwing a deep passion into something that doesn\u2019t make them money, passively entertain them, or get them laid is a little dangerous. It questions things that we don\u2019t always feel comfortable questioning. Like, what\u2019s the point of being alive? How am I different from the people around me, and do I have the courage to celebrate that, knowing that, to some degree of another, I will be punished for it?\nWriters\u2014even dedicated unpublished writers\u2014can spend thousands of hours of their lives working with a craft that pays poorly and inconsistently for the chance to have their efforts casually dismissed by anyone with a Goodreads account. Most writers don\u2019t make a living at it. Most books fail in the marketplace. By any rational standard, what we do is a terrible, terrible idea. Or consider cosplayers who can spend weeks and a fair amount of money on costumes for which they will not receive any professional or monetary credit. Or civil war reenactors who will actually go out in period-style wool uniforms in the heat of summer and man the walls of old forts and sleep in the encampments of the 1800s.\nAll of us are doing something that exists outside the realm of getting a good job and consuming things that entertain us or raise our social status. And the word \u201clove\u201d comes up a lot when we talk about these little enthusiasms. So you see why I reach for \u201cfetish\u201d over \u201chobby.\u201d When I asked what people\u2019s ambitions were, I was reaching for that question. What are we getting out of this? What desires to these things feed?\nThat\u2019s why my first formulation\u2014\u201cWhat is your Ambition?\u201d\u2014was a bad one. I actually meant: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d They heard: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d That\u2019s also a fair question, but it isn\u2019t what I was looking for. The confusion\u2019s pretty easy to track. They thought I was asking about goals, and \u201cgoal\u201d sounds a lot like \u201cend point.\u201d\nOne of the interesting things I\u2019ve found about writing stories is that a lot of times I won\u2019t really understand what the story is about until I get to the end. My instinct is that these projects of ours are similar. Only with stories, there\u2019s another step. I can edit stories. Fix them. Change their shapes to match the meaning that I found only at the end.\nI don\u2019t get to do that with my life. You don\u2019t either. First drafts are what we are. And so, I hoped people would tell me what the end was they imagined their project was working toward. The fact that someone who wins a Hugo or the Booker or the Nobel doesn\u2019t then stop working means that wasn\u2019t the goal. They had some other ambition, because the drive didn\u2019t stop. Likewise a cosplayer who has fashioned the perfect Duela Dent outfit doesn\u2019t, I think, feel a sense of relief at never having to make another costume again. The best we could do, I thought, was define what would actually complete our work.\nIt was a failure of imagination on my part to think that all projects are moving toward completion.\nAnd still, there were things I learned by asking the wrong questions, because the things we think\u2014mistakenly\u2014will satisfy us and tell us something about what our projects are, who we care about, and which fetish precisely we\u2019re cultivating. And, more to the point, which ones we aren\u2019t.\nWhen I was in high school, I was very active in the theater program. I acted, I worked tech, and I volunteered at the local community theater. The important lesson\u2014the one I still carry with me\u2014came very early in that process. I must have been a freshman. I don\u2019t remember the name of the woman who was running the program then, but the play we were working on was called \u201cHer Infinite Variety\u201d. It was basically a Shakespeare clips show with scenes from a bunch of different plays, all focusing on women. I\u2019d gotten the role of Enobarbus from Antony and Cleopatra and all the interstitial bits bridging one scene from another. The only other male in the cast was Chad Thomas playing Petruchio against a Kate by a Stephanie . . . whose last name I can never recall, but she was Nellie\u2019s friend and I liked her. It was not, you could say, the zenith of all high school theater productions. We were very young and greener than grass and uncomfortable in our skins and in ourselves. I have exactly two memories from the play.\nOne of them is being on stage trying not to cough while Chad and Stephanie were the center of attention. The other was one of the most important insights I had in that period of my life.\nWe were at rehearsal in the auditorium. The stage was wood and painted black. There was no one there but us, mumbling our Shakespeare and trying to make our gestures small and unobtrusive. If self-consciousness had mass, we\u2019d have been a singularity. The director despaired. At the end of the hour, she called us all up the edge of the stage and said, \u201cYou\u2019re up here to be seen. You\u2019re up here to be heard.\u201d And I understood. To this day, I have no fear of speaking in public. When I\u2019m in front of a class or a room full of people, I know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m there to be seen and heard.\nIn college, I realized\u2014with some help from a plain-spoken advisor\u2014that theater wasn\u2019t actually the project to which I wanted to dedicate my time and energy.\nIt was writing.\nAnd for a long time, I went looking for something similar. That I didn\u2019t quite know is probably why I spent so much time asking other people. Here I was, spending hours on the work and money on the postage. I knew I was there for something, but I couldn\u2019t articulate what it was.\nI don\u2019t have a penny-drop moment for this. There wasn\u2019t a bolt from the blue that made it all clear. Instead, it\u2019s been a long, slow accretion of opinions, a process of trial and error. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to\u2014This is my ambition: I want to write stories that are hard to put down, that linger in memory, and that can be enjoyed by people who aren\u2019t just like me.\nThat sounds simple. It isn\u2019t. In all the professional writers I asked in all the years I posed the question, no one\u2014not one\u2014said that. They all answered with awards or sales figures or whatever happened to be the tower on their horizon at the time.\nGoals, it seems to me, are like signposts. Ambitions are more like directions. The difference between them is like answering the question Where are you going? with New York or else East, east, farther and farther and always east. Goals, once reached, lose their power. I know that. I\u2019ve reached a lot of mine, and they lose their shine as soon as you have them. They\u2019re good for setting a direction for a while, but once you\u2019re there, they aren\u2019t useful anymore. Ambition never wears out.\nSo, artists and makers and cosplayers and dog agility enthusiasts and composers, I was wondering.

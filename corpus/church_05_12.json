She had snorted a song ten minutes before me, and I couldn\u2019t quite figure why she waited here in the dark confines of the sample booth.\n\u201cRain?\u201d I said. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cDo you hear it, Alex?\u201d she said, not really looking at me. More like staring off in two directions at once, as though her eyes had decided to break off their working relationship and wander aimlessly on their own missions. \u201cIt\u2019s so amaaazing.\u201d\nShe held that \u201ca\u201d a long time. I should\u2019ve remembered how gripping every sample was for her, as though her neurons were built like radio antennae, attuned to whatever channel carried the best track ever recorded. I needed to get her ass on the dance floor before I got so angry that I ended up with another Jessica situation. I still had eight months left on my parole.\n\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d Rain nudged me, hard on the shoulder. \u201cAlex!\u201d Her eyes had made up and decided to work together, locking on me like I was the only male in a sea of estrogen.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s awesome,\u201d I lied. For the third time this week, I\u2019d snorted a dud sample. My brain hadn\u2019t connected with a single, damned note.\nBeyond the booth, the thump, thump of dance beats pulsed in my chest. Not much of a melody, but since they\u2019d insisted I check my headset with my coat, I couldn\u2019t exactly self-audio-tain.\nI grabbed her arm, feeling the soft flesh and liking it. Loving it. Maybe the sample was working on some visceral level beyond my ear-brain-mix. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the dance floor.\u201d\n\u201cIn a minute. Pleeease.\u201d\nOver-vowels were definitely part of her gig tonight.\n\u201cWait for the drop,\u201d she said, stomping her foot.\n\u201cRight.\u201d I watched her sway back and forth, in perfect rhythm with the dance music coming from the main floor. The better clubs brought all the vibes together, so that every song you sampled was in perfect synch with the club mix on the speakers. When the drop hit, everyone jumped and screamed in coordinated rapture.\nI would miss the group-joy here in this tiny booth, with this date who was more into her own head than she would ever be into me. If I could get Rain out on the floor, I could at least feel the bliss, whiff all the pheromones, feel all those sweaty bodies pressed against mine, soft tissues rubbing together.\n\u201cYeaaaah!\u201d She shouted and grabbed my hand, squeezing it. Harder. Her eyes pressed shut, her mouth wide open, she leaned her head way back.\nThe drum beats surged, and then, for a fraction of a second they paused. Everyone in the club inhaled, as though this might be the last lungful of air left in the world and then . . .\nDrop.\nBut drop doesn\u2019t say it all. Not even close. Because when it happens, it\u2019s like the most epic orgasm of all time and pinching the world\u2019s biggest crap-log at the same moment.\nRain opened her eyes and pressed her hand against the side of my cheek. Lunging with remarkable speed for a woman who over-voweled, she kissed me. Her tongue pressed against my lips.\nI tasted her. Wanted her. An image of Jessica popped into my head: the look of terror on her face when I accidentally yanked her under.\nThe euphoria gone, I closed my mouth and turned away from Rain.\n\u201cWhaaat?\u201d she said.\nFor a second, I thought about explaining what I had done to Jessica. Spewed on about how the drop isn\u2019t always built of joy. Instead, I went with the short, obscure answer. \u201cProbation.\u201d\nRain looked at me funny, like she couldn\u2019t quite figure out how the judicial dudes could mess with our kiss-to-drop ratio. Finally, she smiled, and said, \u201cRiiight.\u201d\nDesperate to avoid another over-vowel, I shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s dance!\u201d This time, when I grabbed her arm, she followed along like a puppy.\nScents smacked at us as we pushed our way through the seething mass on the floor. This week\u2019s freebie at the door was Octavia, some new perfume marketed at the twenty-something set. It was heavy on Nasonov pheromones, some bee-juice used to draw worker-buzzers to the hive. When the drug companies cloned it, the result was as addictive as crack and as satisfying as hitting a home run on a club hook-up.\nMy nostrils still ached from snorting a wallop of nanites, but scent doesn\u2019t only swim in the nose. The rest is all neurons, baby, and I had plenty to spare. Apparently so did Rain, because she was waving her nose in the air like a dog catching the whiff of a bitch in heat. The sight of her made me want to take her and do her right there on the floor.\nBut Conduct was a high-end club. The bouncers would toss us both if they caught us in the act anywhere on the premises, so I kept it in my pants. I still had another two hundred in my pocket. Enough for three more samples. Maybe I\u2019d pick up a track from an indie-band this time. Top forty drivel never seized my brainstem.\nUnlike Rain.\nThe beats were building again. This time, with a third-beat thump, like reggae on heroin. I could feel the intensity from my fingertips to my teeth to my dick. Even if I couldn\u2019t hear more than the background beats, I anticipated the drop. Rain opened her mouth again, raised both her hands in the air with everyone else, like a crowd of locusts all swarming together.\nPause.\nDrop.\nMy date kept her eyes closed, her hands on her own breasts as she milked the release for all it was worth. Any decent guy should\u2019ve watched her, should\u2019ve wanted to, but I caught sight of a luscious creature, near the high-end sample booth, in the far right corner of the club. The chick was about to slip between the curtains, but she caught me staring.\nHer eyes glowed the purple of iStim addiction, reminding me of Jessica.\nShe had grown up in the suburbs, her allowance measured in thousands not single dollars. The pack of girls she hung with had all bought iSynchs when they first hit the market. The music sounded better when they could all hear the same song at the same time. For the first time in more than a hundred years, getting high was not only legal, but ten times more amazing than it had ever been before. We all lived in our collective heads, the perfect synch of sound and sex.\nI should\u2019ve turned away from the sight of the purple-chick, should\u2019ve reached out to Rain and kissed her again. Close tonight\u2019s deal. Instead, I approached her swaying body, and next to her ear shouted, \u201cBack in five.\u201d\nShe nodded.\nFueled by fascination, and the two hundred burning a hole in my pocket, I headed for the high-end booth.\nOne of the bald bouncers with tribal tattoos worked the curtains. Yellow earplugs stuck out of both ears, so conversation, or in my case, pleading, wasn\u2019t an option. Feeling in my pocket for the two hundred, I scrunched the bills a bit, trying to make the wad appear larger than its meager value, then pulled out the stack in a flash. I had never dealt with this particular bouncer. Conduct was more Rain\u2019s club than mine, so I hoped the bills would get me past. The guy didn\u2019t even acknowledge me, as though he could smell my poverty, or maybe my parole. His eyes stared straight ahead.\nMy head scarcely came up to his bare chest, so I was uncomfortably close to his nipple-rings, but I held my ground, and pointed at the curtains.\nHe remained statue-like. More boulder-like. Then a woman\u2019s cream-colored hand with purple nails ran from the guy\u2019s waist to his pecs and he turned to the side, like a vault door.\nPurple-chick stood in the gap between the curtains. Her black dress was built of barely enough fabric to meet the dress code. Her hair stood on end like a teenager\u2019s beard, barely there and oddly sexy. She must have dyed it every night, because the stubble matched her eyes and nails. A waking wet dream.\n\u201cCome in.\u201d She pointed beyond the curtains.\n\u201cIn what?\u201d I mumbled to myself.\n\u201cVery funny.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not laughing.\u201d\nMy body neared hers as I moved past into the sample booth. I carried my hands a little higher than would have passed as natural, hoping to cop a feel of all that exposed flesh on my way by. But she read me like a pheromone and dodged back.\nA leather bench-seat lined the far wall of the booth. Three tables were set with products in stacks like poker chips. The first was a sea of purple, tiny lower-case \u201ci\u2019s\u201d stamped on every top-forty sample like a catalog from a so-called genius begging on a street corner for spare music. The second was a mish-mash of undergrounds like Skarface, Audexi, and Brachto.\nThe third table drew me like fire. Only one sample. The dose was pressed into a waffle-pattern, which was weird enough to make my desire itch. But the strangest part was its flat black surface that sucked light away and spewed dread like mourners at a funeral.\nPurple-chick watched me stare at it, waiting for me to speak. My mouth kept opening and closing, but I couldn\u2019t find words.\nExpensive. Dangerous. Parole. All perfectly legit words that I couldn\u2019t voice.\nI had forgotten my two hundred. My palms must have been really sweating, because what had once been a quasi-impressive stack, now stunk of poor-dude-shame.\nWith practiced smoothness, she liberated my cash and said, \u201cThe Audexi works on everyone.\u201d\nDistracted from the waffle, I said, \u201cHow\u2019d you know I couldn\u2019t hear the last track?\u201d\n\u201cYour throat,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not pulsing to the beat.\u201d\nMy fingers felt my pulse beating like a river of vamp-candy. Her observations were bang-on. I wanted to illustrate my coolness, or, at the very least, my lack of lameness, but all I could manage was, \u201cOh.\u201d\nShe laughed.\nMy eyes wandered back to the waffle. I licked my lips.\nGrabbing my chin, she forced me to look at tables one and two. \u201cYour price range.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the waffle?\u201d\n\u201cNew.\u201d\n\u201cFunny.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cFar from it.\u201d\n\u201cAddictive?\u201d I asked, staring at the purple on the first table. How this woman could work the booth without Jonesing for her own product made me rethink her motives.\n\u201cThe absolute best never are,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNo black eyes allowed in the boardroom, huh?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d\nI remembered Rain. By now, she\u2019d have noticed my absence.\nPurple-chick still held my two hundred. Her eyes locked on mine. \u201cTry the Audexi. You won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d\nLike a Vegas dealer, she shoved all of my money through a hole in the wall, selected an Audexi sample from table two, and held it in front of my nose.\nI probably should\u2019ve reported her. All of the clubs had to be careful not to push products hard, end up drawing the cops in to investigate. But my money was long gone and Rain wouldn\u2019t wait much longer.\nI exhaled. The moisture turned the poker-chip-shaped disk into a teeming pile of powder-mimicking nanites, and I snorted. For several blinding seconds, my nose felt as though a nuclear bomb had blown inside. I could feel Purple-chick\u2019s hand on my arm, making sure I didn\u2019t wipe out and sue the club. Then the song erupted in my mind.\nSevenths and thirds. Emo-goth-despair. Snares and the ever-present bass, bass, bass. Music flowed like a tsunami through a village, grabbing ecstasy like cars and plowing through every other thought except for the sweet tweaks of synths and the pulse-grab of the click-track. The song was building, and all I could think about was finding Rain before the drop.\nRain and I danced in nanite-induced harmony until the early dawn. Exhausted and covered in sweat and pheromones, we grabbed our coats and carried rather than wore them outside.\nThe insides of my sore nose stuck together in the frigid air, a wake-up call for the two of us to don our coats or end up with frostbite. I didn\u2019t want to, I was so damned hot and pumped, but I figured I should set a good example for Rain. And the way our night was progressing, I wouldn\u2019t have much time to scan my barcode at the parole terminal before curfew.\nJessica\u2019s fucking choice of words would be killing my buzz for eight more months.\nThat fourth of October had been hot as hell. After clubbing, we both stripped and headed into the lake for a skinny dip. Except she wasn\u2019t skinny and I wasn\u2019t much of a dipper. She\u2019d called me over to the drop and I thought she meant for the lingering song, not the drop-off hidden in the water. When the drop blissed me, I lost my footing and plunged over my head.\n\u201cShit, it\u2019s cooold,\u201d said Rain.\nI snapped back to reality. \u201cStill with the vowels?\u201d\n\u201cScrew you.\u201d She pushed me away and called a cab with the same arm-wave.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be that way, baby.\u201d\n\u201cNow I\u2019m your fucking baby? After ditching me for a dozen drops while you plucked that purple fuzz-head.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw?\u201d\n\u201cWho didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cSorry. But you gotta admit, you and me, we really synched after.\u201d I nudged her, maybe a little too hard. \u201cThe last sample I snorted was worth it. Right?\u201d\nA cab squealed a U-turn and stopped in front of Rain. She started to climb in and then looked up at me.\nI shook my head. Shrugged. \u201cTapped out.\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d She slammed the door in my face and the cab took off up the street.\nI stood there, watching my breath condense in the air, its big cloud distorting her and the cab. The cold clawed its way into me, sucking away my grip on reality. The shivering reminded me to at least wear my coat.\nAs I stuffed my arms into the sleeves, I sniffled, feeling wetness and figuring the cold was making my nose run. But then I noticed the red drops on the ground and the front of my coat. I wiped with one finger and it came back a dark and bloody mass. Dead nanites, blood, snot, all mixed together. Two shakes didn\u2019t get it off my finger, so I rubbed the mess in a snow bank and only managed to make it worse.\nThe nearest subway was blocks away. I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut, shared the cab with Rain and then stiffed her for half the fare. But I\u2019d hurt her enough for one night. Hurt enough women for one lifetime.\nJessica had been the closest thing to a life preserver, so I grabbed on. Tripping on the samples, her brain couldn\u2019t remember how to hold her breath, or at least that\u2019s how my lawyer argued it at the trial.\nAs I trudged for the subway, I concentrated on not slipping and falling on my ass. I found the entrance, and headed down the stairs, gripping the cold metal handrail, even though my warm skin kept sticking to it. The Audexi sample still pulsed through my system and I couldn\u2019t walk down in anything but perfect synch. The song was building to another drop, and I had to make the bottom of the platform before that moment, or I would be another victim of audio-tainment.\nThe platform was nearly empty, save for a few other clubbers too tapped out to cab their way home. Octavia hung in the air, the Nasonov-pheromone-scents calling us all home like buzzers to the hive. Much as I loathed their company, I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to huddle with the others in the same section while we waited for the train.\nOff to our right I caught sight of Purple-chick. She wore a long, black faux-fur coat. The image of her here, slumming it with the poor, was as wrong as a palm tree in a snow bank. She belonged in some limo, holding a glass of champagne.\nI tried to break the pull of the scent-pack, but couldn\u2019t step far enough away from my fellow losers to get within talking distance of Purple-chick. When the train arrived, I watched her step inside, then waited until the last second before I climbed aboard, to make sure we were both on the same train.\nThe cars were so empty that I could see her, way ahead.\nStanding near the doors, she held a pole while she swayed back and forth. I couldn\u2019t figure out why she didn\u2019t sit down, especially after a long night at the club. The rest of us were sprawled on benches, crashing more than sitting.\nI considered the long trek up to her car, but I didn\u2019t trust my balance. Instead, I watched her. Waited until she stepped in front of the doors, announcing her intention to disembark.\nOnce again, I waited until the last second to leave the train, in case she decided to duck back on without me. I could tell that she knew I was watching. Following.\nOkay, stalking.\nShe hurried up the stairs. Either she was training for a marathon, or her samples had all worn off, because I couldn\u2019t keep up. When she reached the top, she turned around and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nInstead of rushing off, she stood there, at the top of the stairs. Waiting.\nHer eyes were blue.\nNot purple.\nI hurried until I stood in front of her, nose to nose. \u201cYou took the waffle?\u201d\nShe nodded.\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cFigures.\u201d I turned away.\n\u201cBut I can show you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d she said.\nI sure as hell didn\u2019t wait for her to change her mind. We shared it all: tongues, saliva, even our teeth scraped against each other, making an awful sound that knocked my sample completely out of my head.\nWhat filled the void wasn\u2019t the pounding of my heartbeat. Or hers. Or any song that I had ever heard. Instead, I could hear her thoughts, as visible as a black blanket on a white sand beach.\n\u201cWow,\u201d I said.\nIsn\u2019t it?\nHer words, not spoken but thought into me. They reverberated around my skull like noise bouncing in an empty club.\nI lost my footing and fell. Down. In. Far away. Suddenly I was six years old and my father leaned over and hauled me back up onto my skate-clad feet. We skated together, him holding me, his back stooped over in that awkward way that would make him curse all evening.\n\u201cFind your balance, Alex. Bend your knees. Skate!\u201d\nI had forgotten how much I loved him. Forgotten what it felt like to be young and innocent, to enjoy the thrill of exercise for its own sake, and feel a connection that didn\u2019t cost the price of a sample.\n\u201cI love you.\u201d But when I looked up at him, he had morphed back into Purple-chick, now Purple-and-blue-chick. She held me, preventing my crash down the stairs.\n\u201cCool, huh?\u201d she said.\n\u201cA total mind-fuck.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so expensive.\u201d\n\u201cHow much? I mean, you\u2019re on the subway, so if I save\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIn my experience, those who ask the price can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d I said.\nShe smiled. \u201cMarketing.\u201d\nI needed a better answer, so I listened for her thoughts. All I sensed was the wind from another subway, blowing up the stairs at me.\nShe turned and hurried for an exit.\n\u201cWait!\u201d My head buzzed, confused by the difference between waffle and real, trapped by the synch-into-memory-lane trip that lingered on my tongue like bad breath.\nHer boots stopped clapping against the lobby of the subway station, but she didn\u2019t look back. I was glad of it, because my memories were still swimming in my head. I wanted her to be Dad.\nNot Dad. Rain. My former date\u2019s cute outfit lingered in my synapses, replacing nostalgia with guilt. I wondered if Rain had made it home okay in the cab.\nThen naked Jessica filled my head, and it was October again.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d I said aloud, my voice echoing against the tile walls. \u201cThe high confused it all. I\u2019ll do another year of parole. I\u2019ll spend my sample money on flowers for your grave. Please, forgive me?\u201d\nStill with her back to me, and in a voice that sounded eerily like Jessica\u2019s, she said, \u201cWhat about Rain?\u201d\nI shook my head, even though she couldn\u2019t possibly see me. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nFar ahead, Purple-and-blue-chick turned to face me. I saw her as them, she had somehow merged with Jessica, the two of them existing in perfect synch, like a sample and the club music stitching together; twins in a corrupted womb. They both saw me for what I was, a lame guy who would always be about eight hundred shy of a right and proper sample. Whose love would always be shallow, too broke to buy modern intimacy.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got less than ten minutes to clock in your parole.\u201d She started walking again, and I watched her leave, one synched step at a time until she exited the station and disappeared along the ever-brightening street.\nDrop.\nOnly this drop, waffle-back-to-real, felt like nails screeching on a blackboard. I wasn\u2019t in my usual subway station, and I had no idea where to find the nearest parole scanner. The station booth was empty, too early for a human. The only person in sight was an older woman with the classic European-widow black-scarf-plus-coat-plus-dress that broadcast, Leave me alone, young scum.\nSo I did.\nI hurried onto the street, and looked towards the sun. It was well above the horizon now, but mostly hidden behind a couple of apartment buildings.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d I told the concealed ball of reddish-yellow light. \u201cHow\u2019d it get so late?\u201d\nThe judiciary alarm buzzed inside my head.\nFor a moment, I could feel a drop, the biggest, most intense and amazing drop I would ever experience. The sort of nirvana that people pursue ineffectually for a lifetime. Or two.\nI had less than ten minutes until the final warning.\nRushing for the nearest, busiest street, I tried to wave down car after car, hoping someone would point me to the nearest scanner. Or maybe they had a portable one, the kind I should\u2019ve brought with me, had I been thinking about more than getting into Rain\u2019s pants when I left.\nPeople ignored me.\nShunned me.\nI smelled of trouble. Which, technically, I was. But I didn\u2019t mean to be. It wasn\u2019t my fault.\nIt was never my fault.\nOne cab slowed, but didn\u2019t stop. The driver made eye contact, and then rushed away.\n\u201cHey!\u201d I considered swearing at him, but I didn\u2019t want to draw the cops.\nI\u2019m not sure why the cabbie stiffed me. Maybe he read my desperation. Maybe he was Rain\u2019s cabbie and he knew I was broke. In any case, he probably broadcast a warning to his buddies, because the next cab that got remotely close made a fast U-turn and took off.\nChoosing a direction, I took off down one street, then hung a right at the next, jogging, skidding, almost falling on my ass. Every direction felt wrong.\nI didn\u2019t see a single person. No one. Not even a pigeon for fuck\u2019s sake. All I needed was a phone.\nWith one hand on a pole, I leaned over, trying to catch my breath. To think.\nMy heart was pounding now, no synch in sight. The song was long gone, the link to Purple-chick disconnected. No one had my back.\nI turned in a circle, then another, scanning far and near for anything of value: an ATM, a phone booth, a coffee shop, a diner, any place where I could access the judicial database. Plead my case.\nThe final warning buzzed.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d My spit froze when it hit the ground.\nI hit full blown panic. My heart tripped like the back-bass before the drop. Only this time, the other side was built of misery not ecstasy.\nIf only I had paid my cell bill. If only my father was still alive, to catch my sorry ass. If only I had lied to Rain, shared her cab. If only Jessica hadn\u2019t called it a drop.\nWhen you\u2019re panicked, it\u2019s tough as hell to keep any rational sense of time. I figured I was cooked. So I closed my eyes. But when the pain didn\u2019t come, I sat down on the cold curb, and felt the chill seep through my clothes.\nI bit my lip. Tasted blood.\nThe first jolt ripped through my body. I wanted to writhe in pain on the sidewalk, but my body was stuck in shock-rigor. An immobile gift for the cops.\nI imagined Rain beside me.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\nShe morphed into Jessica, her purple eyes wide with fear. \u201cI\u2019m lost,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTake my hand.\u201d I wanted to reach out, but I couldn\u2019t move. My fingers looked nearly white in the cold. Her fingers seemed to shiver around mine, as though they were made of joy, not flesh. Then she touched my hand and I knew in that moment that life existed outside of stimulation, in a place where reality wasn\u2019t lame or boring. Life danced to an irregular rhythm that couldn\u2019t synch to any sample.\nShe let go.\nThe judiciary pulse jolted again. I flopped to the pavement, distantly aware that my skull would remind me for a long time after about its current state of squishage.\nThe parole board must have lived for irony, because the jolt lasted for so long that I welcomed the release. A pants-wetting, please-make-it-stop, urgent need for the end.\nDrop.\nSuzanne Church lives near Toronto, Ontario with her two teenaged sons.

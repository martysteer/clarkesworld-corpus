Lobo\nFor the purpose of the Hugo Awards, Clarkesworld is classified as a professional magazine. This has been the case for several years now, but there are still a few people who continue to nominate us for Best Semiprozine. While we appreciate the sentiment, we are NOT eligible for that award. Instead, if you want to recognize our work, please nominate our stories in the appropriate categories and/or nominate me (Neil Clarke) for Editor Short Form.\nOur annual reader\u2019s poll\u2014where readers pick their favorite Clarkesworld story and cover art from 2021\u2014is once again employing a two-phase process:\nPhase One: Nominations (mid-January)\nLater this month, we\u2019ll open for a forty-eight hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement for this phase will be sent out via:\n- Twitter (twitter.com/clarkesworld)\n- Facebook (www.facebook.com/clarkesworld)\n- Patreon (www.patreon.com/clarkesworld)\n- My blog (neil-clarke.com)\nThe purpose of the brevity of this phase is to create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. Previous efforts have proved this to be effective at meeting these goals.\nPhase Two: Final Voting (February)\nThe five finalists in each category will be announced in my February editorial. Final voting will open on the 1st and continue through the 15th. The winners will be announced in our March issue.\nHappy New Year! May things only get better from here!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

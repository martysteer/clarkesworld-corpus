Ever since then I\u2019ve kept an eye out for her remarkable stories, and I\u2019m sure that over the years\u2014my reality-bound ophthalmologist to the contrary\u2014this has enhanced if not my vision then at the very least my sense of perspective.\n These days whenever I\u2019m at conventions I make it a point to attend whatever writing-related panels Cat is on, as she\u2019s a veritable fount of useful, experience-based advice, always leavened with humor. Somewhat surprisingly, the conversation below was our first lengthy exchange.\n Cat Rambo lives and writes in the Pacific Northwest, with occasional peregrinations elsewhere. A World Fantasy Award and Nebula nominee, she has 200+ fiction publications, which have appeared in Asimov's, Tor.com, and Clarkesworld, as well as in audio form and a dozen different languages. She is the current Vice President of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Check her website for links to her fiction and information about her popular online classes.\n You\u2019ve been publishing short fiction prolifically since around 2005 and Beasts of Tabat, just released, is your debut novel. Did you see yourself as going through some kind of craft apprenticeship by writing those 200+ short stories, a way of building up to a novel, or was it not planned that way?\n It wasn\u2019t planned that way at all. My plan was to get out of Clarion West in 2005 and write a just absolutely killer novel that would set the world afire. But while I was at Clarion West, every once in a while someone would say to us, \u201cSome of you won\u2019t write after the class.\u201d Or, \u201cSome of you will be so busy processing that you\u2019ll be totally blocked for months.\u201d And worse, \u201cSome people never write again.\u201d My response was pretty much, \u201cFuck that!\u201d\n I came out of Clarion completely determined not to do that and I started a novel immediately. For two months after Clarion West I also made myself write a short story a week, and one of the things I\u2019d learned is that you send stuff out, so I would send the stories out. I kept working on the novel, and some of the stories hit. A year and a half went by and I was still working on the novel and my husband said, \u201cDo you think possibly you may need to put that aside for a while and work on something else?\u201d I was just beating my head against this thing. So I did write something else, and then came back to the novel, and so on. I\u2019ve been working on Beasts of Tabat in one form or another since 2005!\n Those forms have been very different. An early version of the book, for example, was set in the school that is featured in Beasts of Tabat, the Brides of Steel, but it involved two of the students, because at the time I was thinking in terms of YA. And then this instructor who was one of the gladiators sort of swaggered in and demanded that the story be hers\u2014and that was my introduction to Bella Kanto, who\u2019s half of the current book. I may go back and write from the point of view of those two students at some point and pick up that YA story, because even though it\u2019s a different plotline I know where it fits into the events of Beasts of Tabat.\n Most of my Tabat stories do in fact link in to each other. When I was going back to them and also writing this version, thinking of it as the first volume of a quartet, I realized that one of the stories spells out the final arc, another spells out a side character\u2019s backstory, and so on. In a sense the prewritten stories\u2014and the ones yet to be written\u2014are like a fifth, shadow volume to go alongside the quartet of novels.\n I started doing it because my husband and I were going to go on a lengthy road-trip. I had a big backlog of stories because I\u2019m fairly prolific and I didn\u2019t want to have to fuss with having to send stuff out while on the road. So I set up a Patreon campaign, and it\u2019s been pretty good. I know I can write a story, put it up, people will like it, and I will get money for it, which is really nice.\n One reason I\u2019m keeping the Patreon campaign going is that one day I\u2019d like to have my own spec fic magazine, if I can get to the funding levels needed and the Patreon campaign keeps swelling. It may take several years. Or maybe I\u2019ll find another route. But I\u2019d really like to do a magazine at some point.\n That\u2019s exciting. I have to say I loved the design of your collection Near + Far, which has two front covers and can be read starting from either end, like the old Ace doubles. What made you pick that particular design?\n I originally had been talking to a friend, Tod McCoy with Hydra House here in Seattle, about publishing with his house. I\u2019d first thought of doing this collection as a two-volume set, because I was in love with little box sets. I thought we could do a tiny box set and it would be really cool, one volume for near future stories, one for far future. Then at some point I was thinking about Ace doubles, and I realized we could not have as many stories but have it as one book that you could open from both sides. I remember thinking at the time that the idea was genius. I called up Tod and said, \u201cI\u2019m a genius! Are you sitting down? This is sooo good, it\u2019s going to blow you away!\u201d Two weeks later I\u2019m at the dealer\u2019s room at Norwescon and there, of course, is someone who has already done a double-sided book.\n I like Near + Far because among other things Tod went and looked at hundreds of the old Ace double covers and if you look at it, you can see that he pulled in some of the design elements from those. He really tried to give it that feel.\n And we\u2019re doing a sequel.\n Near + Far gathered primarily science fiction stories. Will the sequel focus more on fantasy?\n Yes, it\u2019s a fantasy companion volume to Near + Far. It\u2019s called Neither Here Nor There. One side is secondary-world fantasy stories, and the other side is fantasy in our own world. We\u2019re shooting for a Fall release date; I think it\u2019s coming out in October.\n I\u2019m really pleased with it. I actually pitched it a couple of years ago, but it took a little while for it to come together. Tod just needs to relax and realize that I\u2019m a genius and he should just do what I like.\n Can you tell me a little about your connection with John Barth, who gave you a great blurb when he described your writing as \u201cworks of urban mythopoeia\u201d?\n When I first went off to grad school, I went to the writing seminars at Johns Hopkins. I was a member of the last graduate class that John Barth taught before he retired. I adored him. He was wonderful. There was a fellowship that I was up for, and what you quoted was part of his recommendation.\n I\u2019ve always liked that blurb very much. It\u2019s John Barth! I send him a copy of each of my books and I always get this nice postcard back that says something like, \u201cWell, this is not exactly my cup of tea, but good job!\u201d\n How has your work for SFWA influenced your perception of the science fiction community?\n I\u2019d learned early on, when I was at Hopkins, that just because someone is a terrific writer that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re a terrific human being. It\u2019s one of those shattering lessons, where you\u2019re like, \u201cOh crap!\u201d It\u2019s sometimes sad, when it\u2019s somebody whose work you really like.\n But the thing I have learned from being at SFWA is that the pay-it-forward ethos is just pervasive in the science fiction and fantasy culture, in a way that is truly amazing to behold. And in my experience it wasn\u2019t that way in literary fiction at all. There it was more like, \u201cHere come the new people, let\u2019s try to kill them before they get a novel published.\u201d\n In science fiction I think people are much kinder, much gentler. Of course this is a sort of ironic moment to be saying this, because we\u2019re seeing some really horrible, contentious controversies going on right now. I don\u2019t really know what to say about all of that, except that I believe, at heart, that fandom is kind and gentle and inclusive. Kindness will prevail.\n Talking about the generosity of the field: your various roles within science fiction and fantasy have put you in touch with plenty of up-and-comers. Any new voices you\u2019d like to recommend or single out?\n I\u2019m going to point to a number of them. One of them is Usman Malik, who is on the Nebula ballot this year. He came through my class and I already warned him that I would now take credit for everything that he does because he was one of my students. Kristi Charish just published an urban fantasy novel, with more in the pipeline. Jamie Lackey would be another writer to watch. Julia Rios, who is now one of the editors of Strange Horizons. I also count her as one of mine\u2014I\u2019m ruthless, once they\u2019ve come through my class, I claim them forever. When I\u2019m teaching online I see them as little boxes on my screen, but it\u2019s always lovely to see them at the cons later.\n You edited Fantasy Magazine with Sean Wallace from 2007 to 2011. Did editing take away some of your writing energy?\n Oh yeah, definitely. One of the things that was very nice for me when I started working with Fantasy Magazine was that Edmund Schubert, who was working on Intergalactic Medicine Show, spent some time on the phone with me and said, \u201cYou have to realize that the same part of your brain that is the writing part is also the editing part.\u201d When I was editing Fantasy one of the things I was very clear about in interviews was that I always thought of myself as a writer first. I didn\u2019t want to become an editor primarily. Though I enjoy editing greatly, I wanted to be a writer more than an editor. Creating my own stuff is very important to me.\n Has editing Fantasy affected how you approach writing your own fantasy stories?\n Other than inspiring an irrational hatred of pirates, I think it\u2019s made me a better writer because it\u2019s made me articulate my philosophy of writing. To give someone good feedback you have to say the belief that you feel they are violating or not violating. Teaching is the same way. In order to explain something you have to understand it. In fact I think teaching is one of the best things for my writing.\n You teach close to twenty different classes on all aspects of writing and career management, from how writers can build an online presence to literary techniques for genre fiction, a class out of which was born Rachel Swirsky\u2019s Hugo-winning story, \u201cIf You Were A Dinosaur, My Love.\u201d How do you decide what to teach, and who were some of the teachers that helped you when you were starting out?\n I want to clarify that on the spec fic techniques class, Rachel was just sitting in on the class and having fun playing with ideas; I don\u2019t know that I have anything to teach Rachel, she\u2019s just amazing.\n I started teaching writing science fiction and fantasy stories because I was teaching for a local college and I had a lot of people asking me about those particular genres. When Google Hangouts popped up I thought it was cool and started using that.\n The reasons I\u2019ve added classes are because someone has proposed or requested them, or because they\u2019re based on classes I\u2019ve taught before. The class on delivery and description, for example, is one someone had asked me for, but the flash fiction class is based on a class I taught at Hopkins. The literary techniques class is actually one I originally taught as a one-day Clarion West workshop. I test classes, and if there\u2019s not a lot of demand for something I tend to drop it off the roster. This April and May I\u2019m teaching a really limited slate, and it\u2019s because I knew I wouldn\u2019t have much time and I picked my very favorite classes to teach.\n Regarding my own teachers: at Clarion West I was lucky enough to have Octavia Butler, Andy Duncan, Connie Willis, Gordon Van Gelder and Michael Swanwick. Amazing people. And after that, I kept taking one-day workshops around here. I took one with Paul Park, one with John Crowley. Karen Joy Fowler also had a fantastic class.\n Andy, Connie, and Michael have been very kind in being mentor figures too. Michael in particular I email periodically; I\u2019ll say something angst-ridden, and he sort of pats my head and he says, \u201cGo back to writing,\u201d and I say, \u201cThank you.\u201d I outsource my anxieties to him and he knows just what to say!\n Karen Joy Fowler wrote that your own descriptions are \u201cgorgeous.\u201d Fine attention to sensory detail was one of the things that first drew me to your stories. Are you particularly conscious of descriptive passages in your work? Who are some of the authors you feel excel at description?\n Yes, I do pay a lot of attention to description. Part of it is that when I was at Hopkins I took a fabulous class that was specifically on description, in which we read Colette, Kawabata, Nabokov and others. We were looking very carefully at individual passages. I still sometimes copy out passages if I really love them.\n So who do I love for description right now? Certainly Catherynne M. Valente. She\u2019s got that prose that\u2019s juicy and beautiful\u2014like eating tangerines. Dorothy Dunnett, who wrote historical fiction. Delany would be another one. I was just looking at Babel-17 again recently. He manages a page\u2019s worth of description in a single line. He\u2019s just found that single, beautiful detail; it\u2019s like a fractal, and everything crystallizes out from it.\n The Beasts of Tabat is the first in a projected quartet. Why four novels rather than, for example, a trilogy? Do you know how the overall story ends? How much planning did you do before you sat down to write the first novel?\n Originally I did think it would be a trilogy. A lot of people write fantasy trilogies, after all. But then I realized there was too much stuff I wanted to cover, and the structure that I wanted to do didn\u2019t work with a trilogy. The structure is an odd one: the second book starts midway through the first book, and follows two different characters throughout the entire book, and then the third book starts in the middle of that book, and then the fourth book is going to be this cavalcade of stuff.\n The fourth book, Gods of Tabat, isn\u2019t written but I do know what\u2019s going to happen. I know the overall plotline, I know certain moments, and I know pretty much what will happen to each major character. There\u2019s a lot of side characters I\u2019m still not sure about, in terms of where they\u2019ll be. Book three, Exiles in Tabat, is an inchoate mass right now. Book two, Hearts of Tabat, is pretty much totally plotted and about half-way written. I hope to turn it in by July. This is one of the advantages of being with a small press; we could actually see volume two out this year. That could make for a great publishing schedule. It\u2019s satisfying and a little frightening at the same time.\n Were there previous attempts at novel-writing?\n Yes, there were several. My first was a YA story. It\u2019s about a heroine who is this reluctant champion of Faerie and also just happens to be a little chubby. People keep getting bitchy about it and she says, \u201cScrew you. This is who I am.\u201d My first agent shopped it around and no one wanted to buy it. I do want to go back and rewrite it one day\u2014I suspect I\u2019ve learned enough things that I could make it more sellable now. Then I gave my agent a different book, a paranormal romance, and she shopped that around and no one wanted to buy it either. I\u2019m kind of glad it wasn\u2019t picked up because I\u2019m not very happy with it.\n I also started writing an urban fantasy called The Easter Bunny Must Die, with a world a little like the world of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? I got halfway through that and will probably go back and finish it at some point.\n With Beasts of Tabat, I\u2019m conscious that this is the sort of book I\u2019d like to be known for. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s a good, interesting fantasy novel, and has some serious stuff at its heart too.\n Alvaro is the co-author, with Robert Silverberg, of When the Blue Shift Comes, which received a starred review from Library Journal.

The guy was red around the eyes, his blue-gray chin bristling with stubble. He wore a denim jacket draped over his police uniform shirt with the zipper open; his bulging belly really showed off the food stain stretched over it. Wrinkles covered his trousers. He\u2019d probably spent last night sleeping in the office\u2014no wonder his wife had run off with another man.\nI stood up and gestured a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the top floor. I need to buy a cup of coffee.\u201d\nTen years ago, back when Quanzhou\u2019s Citong Port District was still rolling in lucre, the city\u2019s budget allowances had seemed inexhaustible. The police chief had bought a pile of recreational equipment and set up a police break area on the top floor. Back then, every afternoon break, everyone would get together and play billiards, fifteen bucks a match. Song Mike would always lose to me. Eventually, he stopped playing. Maybe he decided that losing to the girl rookie was too much of a loss of face.\nThese days, the game room and gym were a ghost town. Only the coffee vending machine in the corner still saw any use.\nI invited him to an espresso and grabbed an Americano for myself. After an entire day of suffering through paperwork, I needed a pick-me-up too.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a job. Rich lady came calling, saying her android disappeared.\u201d Song Mike pried up the pull tab and rubbed at his nose. \u201cSounds like that kind that\u2019s been privately modded.\u201d\n\u201cThat kind?\u201d I raised an eyebrow.\nIn the Port District, you couldn\u2019t own a car on the salary from the police station. Everyone would take up some private detective jobs on their own; the higher-ups turned a blind eye, unless you went too far. Song Mike would sometimes take me on as a partner, especially when he needed to interact with females. He was an old-fashioned man; in some areas, he maintained a rare kind of prudery.\nNaturally, I wasn\u2019t against the arrangement. Who\u2019d turn down a side gig?\n\u201cLooks like that kind of . . . \u201d He fished out his phone, pulled up a photo, and handed it to me.\nThere were two people in the photo. One was a woman, already crossed into middle age. She was dressed in a camel-colored long coat and pretty expensive-looking shoes. She faced the camera, her smile dispassionate and formal. The missing android stood at her side with a focused expression, staring at its owner\u2019s profile. It was extraordinarily handsome, bearing a sense of artistry beyond what could be found in products off the assembly line. This guy couldn\u2019t have come cheap.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that Liu Yan?\u201d I asked.\nThe woman in the photograph would have been instantly recognizable to anyone in Quanzhou, with her regular appearances in business news headlines. In recent years, she\u2019d announced her retirement and came to maintain a much lower profile, but she still remained an important figure.\n\u201cShe says that\u2019s her secretary of business affairs. It knows a lot of confidential secrets\u2014that\u2019s why she has to have it back.\u201d Song Mike gave a dry cough. \u201cI don\u2019t think their relationship is as straightforward as she says. She couldn\u2019t give me this android secretary\u2019s model number. She said it was a private custom model.\u201d\n\u201cWow . . . \u201d I was admiring the handsome man in the photo once more, expressing my approval for this lady\u2019s taste.\n\u201cShe arranged to speak in person with me at her home one hour from now,\u201d Song Mike said, retrieving his phone. \u201cI think the conversation would go better with you there.\u201d\n\u201cA rich lonely lady who played with fire and got burned, trying to find her missing android boy toy.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cSounds like good money.\u201d\nI rose to my tiptoes and chucked my empty coffee can halfway across the room into the trash bin. Perfect shot. I glanced at my watch: \u201cI\u2019ll get my things. I\u2019ll meet you in ten minutes in the parking lot.\u201d\nOn previous occasions, Song Mike would mutter if you weren\u2019t wearing a dress, who could tell you\u2019re a woman.\nBut it seemed like he was in a low mood today. He only gave me a glance without saying anything.\n01.\nSong Mike drove his battered Volkswagen while I sat in the backseat, my laptop bouncing along on my lap. We were crossing the decayed city center of Quanzhou; in the distance, we could see the warm colors of the lanterns of Kaiyuan Temple in the dusk. The Ghost Festival was once more nearly upon us.\nFlocks of jobless youths wandered the streets in the fine rain, their fluorescent plastic outfits shimmering. They climbed onto the window ledges of abandoned shopping centers, kicking their long legs and chewing gum. Someone recognized Song Mike\u2019s car, raised a middle finger, and spat in our direction.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to deal with that?\u201d I said, half-teasingly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not on the clock,\u201d Song Mike said, his tone weary. \u201cBesides, what can we do? Beat up this crowd of brats?\u201d\nBut Bin District on the city outskirts was a completely different world. The sea, surface rippling with the last light of sunset, skimmed past the car window. A line of birds returning to their nests touched down lightly upon the white shore. Here, even the sand had been imported straight from some foreign island. House prices in Bin District had hit six digits all the way back in \u201972.\nAnd our client lived in one of these villas.\nSadly, we weren\u2019t in a mood to appreciate the rare sight of such moneyed scenery. Song Mike had me use the opportunity to look up the client\u2019s\u2014Liu Yan\u2019s\u2014background.\nThere was a lot of information on her on the Internet, but most of it came from official business news reports and interviews. There wasn\u2019t much we could use. Liu Yan came from humble origins; several rounds of outer space investment in her youth had launched her into wealth. Afterward, she\u2019d left Beijing to quietly live in Quanzhou\u2019s Citong Port District, but she still held large numbers of shares in several noteworthy corporations. She\u2019d been married once\u2014her ex-husband Lu Guotao had also been a big name in the business world, only to flee under suspicion of serious business wrongdoing quite a number of years ago. They used to operate as a husband-wife team, yet Liu Yan had miraculously come through the business unscathed, managing to keep her own assets.\nI rapidly flipped through the search results, picking out the important bits to read out loud. \u201cI can\u2019t find much negative news about her online. Does she naturally keep a low profile or is she just good at PR?\u201d\nSong Mike snorted. \u201cHow many rich people keep their asses clean?\u201d\nAfter his investigation into that warehouse massacre case several years ago had gotten shut down, he\u2019d been allergic to rich folks.\nI ignored him, continuing to look through the sources. \u201cHer ex-husband Lu Guotao has an interesting background. Before he got rich off of asteroid real estate, he earned an MD in neurology, and even held a university teaching position related to AI research. He only went into business in his middle age.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d answered Song Mike, uninterested.\n\u201cThey seemed to get along quite well as husband and wife.\u201d I looked at the screen; just a bit of searching presented me with photos of Lu Guotao and Liu Yan together in various old news articles. There\u2019d never been rumors of extramarital affairs associated with Lu Guotao. It was rare to see for someone at his tier of wealth.\n\u201cNot that it stopped her from getting a robot for her loneliness after her husband ran off.\u201d Song Mike sounded awfully bitter.\nWe\u2019d entered the villa district. Everyone was starting and stopping, presenting invitation codes to the countless security systems.\nOn either side of the sandstone-paved road were little houses shaded by palm trees. The Chinese redbuds were dropping their flowers, carpeting the ground in decaying red. Liu Yan\u2019s house was deep within the lake area, a two-story Western-style house, completely snow-white, with a big terrace to one side extending straight into the bay. Wicker chairs and patio umbrellas were arranged on the terrace, so that you couldn\u2019t help but envision those long, idle afternoon hours.\nOnly the lights in the living room were on.\nWe sat in the car looking at it for a while, speculating on the overall cost of Chez Liu\u2019s security system while we were there. Several stealth surveillance drones patrolled above the roof. Not even the biggest bank in Quanzhou got fancier than that.\n\u201cYou\u2019d be as safe here as if you lived in a fortress,\u201d I sighed. I took out my compact, straightened my hair, and touched up my makeup.\nSong Mike had changed into a clean dark blue suit before leaving. I maintained it for him in the changing room at the police station for situations like the one in front of us. After his divorce, I\u2019d taken on the duty of making him occasionally look presentable. Some people in the station gossiped that we\u2019d gotten together, but we understood that nothing like that was going to happen between us. He\u2019d brought me into the profession in the first place; it was natural that we\u2019d take care of each other.\nThat was all.\nTen or so seconds after we rang the doorbell, the lady of the house opened the door.\nLiu Yan looked somewhat younger than she had in the photos. Long, thick raven-black hair fell to her shoulders. Only a few signs of artificial tweaking marked her features, which were worthy of being described as stately and lovely. She\u2019d known that Song Mike would bring a female partner, so she was only dressed in velvet yoga clothes and slippers.\nI really hoped that I\u2019d still have a waist as slender as hers when I was in my forties.\n\u201cSergeant Song. Miss Ouyang.\u201d She shook hands with us in turn. Her voice was soft and sweet. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful that you\u2019d take the time to help me resolve my little personal problem.\u201d\nSong Mike nodded.\nWe walked into the living room and sat on one corner of the sofa. Liu Yan\u2019s home didn\u2019t give off any of the signs of the nouveau riche. Every article of furniture was expensive in a simple, elegant way. A dry-brush landscape ink painting scroll hung on the wall. Definitely an original, I thought.\nLiu Yan personally brought us tea.\nI was surprised. A fancy house like this, without a housekeeper.\n\u201cForgive me, normally, these duties would be performed by 3908,\u201d she explained apologetically. \u201cAfter its disappearance\u2014\u201d\n\u201c3908?\u201d I raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the name of my missing android secretary. It came up with the name itself. I\u2019d wanted to give it a more humanoid name, but it was very stubborn on this point.\u201d Liu Yan laughed.\nSong Mike and I exchanged a look.\n\u201cThis is also why I hope to find 3908 as soon as possible. It\u2019s\u2014highly intelligent. I\u2019m afraid of it being subjected to suffering and harm.\u201d Liu Yan hesitated for a few seconds, her thin hands clasped over her knees. The raised veins on the backs of her hands were the only places where her body revealed its true age.\n\u201cIntelligent? You mean, the program in its cybertronic brain isn\u2019t the version generally available on the market?\u201d Song Mike asked.\nI glanced at him.\nHe seemed somewhat reckless today, accusing the client of exploiting a legal gray area right off the bat. This wasn\u2019t going to help us draw out information. To tamper with an android\u2019s cybertronic brain programming was technically a crime but faced with companies\u2019 quest for profit and geeks\u2019 curiosity, the law was increasingly becoming empty paper.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important,\u201d Liu Yan said, with a faint lift of her head. Her voice rose. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying, you can treat this as a missing person case with a real person. Perhaps it seems absurd to you, but ever since I started living alone, it\u2019s been my only companion. I see it as a member of my family.\u201d\n\u201cWe understand how you feel.\u201d Smiling at her, I took out a paper notebook and pen\u2014for some reason, the gesture always made clients feel like they were being taken seriously. \u201cAnd AI inspection is outside of our purview. It\u2019s just that we need to understand the logic driving your android secretary\u2019s actions to better figure out what happened to it.\u201d\nLiu Yan\u2019s expression eased somewhat.\nI stealthily shot Song Mike a look. \u201cCould you describe the exact circumstances of its disappearance?\u201d\n\u201cIt was yesterday morning,\u201d Liu Yan said. She became calm and methodical as she began her recollections. I was reminded that she\u2019d once been a successful businesswoman. \u201c3908 is also my fully authorized business representative. I had it visit the company office to interview a new director of financial affairs. But at the appointed hour, the company called me saying that 3908 hadn\u2019t arrived at the meeting room. I was taken aback and concerned. I had my people search the entire route. 3908\u2019s car was parked on the frontage road next to the highway near the company. The door was locked. There were no signs of force. It was simply that the android had disappeared.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t your android equipped with a location tracker?\u201d Song Mike asked.\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d Liu Yan shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t like having surveillance on its body. I removed the device on its behalf.\u201d\nI wrinkled my brow.\n\u201cForgive me, ma\u2019am.\u201d Song Mike leaned forward. \u201cJust what level of independence and intelligence does your android possess?\u201d\n\u201c3908 is the work of an artist friend. I admit, it doesn\u2019t run the standard program,\u201d Liu Yan said. She didn\u2019t seem to mind Song Mike\u2019s repeated attempt to intimidate. \u201c3908\u2019s intellectual capacity is beyond my ability to quantify in specific terms. After all, I\u2019m not a field expert.\u201d\nThe corner of her lips curved faintly, as if she\u2019d thought of something. \u201cAll I can say is that in day-to-day interactions, it\u2019s completely identical to a normal human being, simply more innocent. It\u2019s a good boy.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am, you\u2019ve really got guts.\u201d Song Mike shook his head. \u201cOnce the programming goes wrong\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTo live in this world is to accept risk,\u201d said Liu Yan, lifting her gaze. \u201cNext to the impenetrability of the human heart, I\u2019d rather have a robot as a companion.\u201d\nAs police officers who interacted daily with the evils of humanity, we were both wordless for a time.\n\u201cWhy do you think it disappeared? Who would want it?\u201d I tapped the paper with the point of my pen, breaking the silence.\n\u201cI really\u2014don\u2019t know.\u201d Liu Yan spread her hands a little. \u201cI\u2019m largely retired. I\u2019m only involved with the company in a nominal advisory capacity. My social connections in Quanzhou aren\u2019t complicated either. I have no enemies. It\u2019s possible that someone kidnapped 3908 under the assumption that it has important corporate secrets in its head.\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have value to someone else on its own?\u201d Song Mike asked again.\n\u201cIn terms of monetary value, it would be worth a top-tier luxury car, I suppose. My friend\u2019s creations have always had very high market value.\u201d The corner of Liu Yan\u2019s mouth lifted; her smile was a little ironic. \u201cIt could be resold after reformatting the brain. It\u2019s very beautiful. It could easily find a buyer.\u201d\nShe thought some more, then added, \u201cI\u2019ve also put out word that I\u2019d be willing to ransom it back for a good price, but as of yet, no one has contacted me.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Song Mike muttered.\nAfter the third round of tea, we said our farewells and left.\nLiu Yan escorted us to the gate. A night wind was blowing; her body seemed especially frail under the soft athletic top. I once again noticed how vacant and quiet this whole villa seemed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll contact you if we find anything,\u201d I said, clasping her hand and shaking it gently. Surprisingly, I kind of liked her.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s already too badly destroyed when you find it, don\u2019t show me the pictures,\u201d she said. She sniffled. Her cool, refined outer shell had abruptly cracked. \u201cJust tell me what happened. Don\u2019t let me see the pictures.\u201d\n02.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Back in the car, I huddled up to the heater, rubbing my hands together.\nThat villa was as cold as an icebox. It wasn\u2019t even September yet, but I was covered in goose bumps.\nSong Mike didn\u2019t answer, busy lighting a cigarette.\n\u201cTheir relationship probably isn\u2019t as spicy as we envisioned. She sees that android more like a pet dog,\u201d I added.\nOr a friend. But instinct told me that Song Mike wouldn\u2019t want to hear that word.\nOnce he\u2019d deep-exhaled two masses of smoke, thoroughly polluting the air inside the car, he gave me a sidelong glance. \u201cDid you really not notice?\u201d\n\u201cAh?\u201d I leaned over, appropriated the lighter and pack of cigarettes, and lit one for myself. \u201cNotice what?\u201d\n\u201cThat big house didn\u2019t have a single living soul inside.\u201d He turned the ignition; the old Volkswagen engine coughed to life. \u201cThat woman\u2019s an android too.\u201d\nI choked on smoke, nearly hacking out a lung. \u201cNo way . . . have androids gotten that realistic already?\u201d\nI carefully thought back on how it had felt to shake hands with Liu Yan, the texture of the skin, the warmth, the amount of force exerted. All of it had been indistinguishable from a human.\n\u201cWhere do you think we live? There are no prohibitions here like there are in the big cities.\u201d Song Mike shrugged. \u201cThese hyperrealistic products have been out on the market for years.\u201d\nI shivered a little, not from cold. \u201cWhere? Out of the people we see on a day-to-day basis\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your mind going?\u201d Song Mike guffawed. \u201cThose replica people look pretty on the outside, but they all act like dopes. It\u2019s easy to tell the difference. The one we met today is different\u2014that\u2019s a real high-end product. I\u2019ve never seen this impressive a replica. But there\u2019s still some tiny differences if you look\u2014I can\u2019t put them into words myself.\u201d\n\u201cWhere did you see the dopey replica people?\u201d I asked, watching him.\nHe averted his gaze.\nI thought about it and understood. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone to Shuicai too?\u201d\nShuicai Street boasted the biggest brothel in Citong Port. Every half year, the station sent someone down to inspect the girls\u2019 health certificates. I\u2019d gone too, and all I could say was, hell on earth. Row upon row of gene-edited girls, stunningly beautiful and mentally hobbled, sitting lined up behind the glass display window waiting for guests.\nNaturally they were healthy, born with a long list of disease immunities. They would live with the ageless faces of young girls until seventy, and only then begin to decline and age.\nAnd they\u2019d be eternally happy, never to ponder the questions that brought pain to humankind.\nCompared to me, stressing every day over making rent, I didn\u2019t know who ought to pity whom. If they were using robots to replace them\u2014it didn\u2019t seem that bad a thing.\nSong Mike cranked the car window down a crack, letting out the miasma that the two of us had produced. \u201cDo you have anything else this evening?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s pay a visit to that android maker. He lives in Shijing. No one knows his real name, but they call him the Jiali Craftsman.\u201d\nJiali was local dialect for \u201cpuppet show.\u201d Now that I thought about it, it made a good nickname for a maker of replica androids.\nSong Mike knew him.\nTo tell the truth, I wasn\u2019t surprised at all. At Chez Liu, when Song Mike didn\u2019t expend energy on interrogating Liu Yan about her \u201cartist friend,\u201d I\u2019d known that he had to already know something. Moreover, the nature of this case had turned from \u201crich lady trying to find her stolen sexbot on the down-low\u201d toward a stranger direction, thoroughly arousing my sense of curiosity.\nAside from that, Song Mike\u2019s state of mind didn\u2019t seem quite right. I didn\u2019t want to leave him to go at this alone.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. I don\u2019t have work tomorrow,\u201d I said.\n03.\nShijing after dark was a land of wonders.\nMore than a decade ago, this had been the busiest place in Citong. Every day, hundreds of mega-scale interstellar cargo ships would set anchor at the port in an unceasing river, bringing with them an infinite flow of cash, new technology, and travelers. Back then, the entire Port District had been as profligate as one of the oil countries from the olden days.\nWe\u2019d all thought the good times would last forever.\nThen came wormhole shipping. Cargo ships no longer needed to dock here. The Port District had deteriorated with shocking speed into an underground market, even becoming a gathering place for outside fugitives and the jobless. I could be wearing a police uniform and armed with a gun, but even during the day, I\u2019d think twice about going here alone.\nComing here with Song Mike, at least, I didn\u2019t have to worry for my safety. He parked the battered Volkswagen outside and led me into Shijing on foot. After the rain, puddles had accumulated on the long-neglected surface of the road, reflecting the colorful storefronts on either side of the street. Most were selling bootleg video games and banned substances, with stands hawking vermicelli congee and fried oysters interspersed among them, wafting inviting scents.\nAs we walked, people kept coming up to him and throwing an arm over his shoulder. Only his strength of will kept him from getting dragged into a bar to \u201cdrink a couple.\u201d As for me, I tried hard not to stare at the body self-remodeling aficionados. Their electronic organs were exposed outside their bodies, hearts and lungs even painted with fluorescent pigments, brightening and dimming with their breath and heartbeat. Noticing my peeking, they began to whistle. \u201cHey, these aren\u2019t the only parts we\u2019ve remodeled!\u201d\nI turned away my gaze.\n\u201cThat lives here.\u201d Hands in pockets, Song Mike gestured with his chin at a large, rundown building.\nThe windows of the building were pitch-black.\n\u201cWhat grudge do you have against him?\u201d I\u2019d heard the disgust in his voice. I inspected the stun baton hidden up my sleeve; it was black market equipment I\u2019d gotten myself, smaller than a pencil, but capable of zapping a hulking grown man into pissing himself on the ground.\nHe gave me a sidelong look. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you afterward.\u201d\nWe came to the front of the building. The glass door of the foyer had been shattered long ago. A metal grille and an old-fashioned cable lock kept the homeless out.\nSong Mike rattled the metal grille. Its creaks were earsplitting in the silence of the night.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re in there,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t open the door within the next three minutes, I\u2019m coming tomorrow with an arrest warrant.\u201d\nNo sound came from inside the building.\nSong Mike and I stood outside the grille. The night wind pierced my outfit.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come out,\u201d he said.\nIndeed, a little while later, a flashlight ray brightened the interior of the building. Dragging footsteps approached. I narrowed my eyes; once they\u2019d adjusted to the light, I could see the new arrival. The \u201cJiali Craftsman\u201d was a small man, hunchbacked and hairless. He wore an old military uniform with no insignia. His face was covered in wrinkles, but his eyes were quick. He could have been anywhere from thirty to seventy.\nHe opened the cable lock with a jangle of keys, letting us inside. I noticed that his hands were long, white, and slender; the nails were speckled with filth. Up close, he stank of alcohol.\n\u201cYou promised you wouldn\u2019t bother me,\u201d he complained in a little voice.\n\u201cAs long as you behave, I\u2019d naturally have better things to do than deal with you.\u201d Song Mike snorted. \u201cGo, let\u2019s inspect your workshop.\u201d\nHe hesitated, then took us onto a somehow still-functional elevator to the basement.\nThe huge space was brightly lit. When I made out the scene in front of me, I had to take a deep exhale to get myself under control, to not scream.\nHuman body parts lay scattered everywhere. Arms, legs, female chest cavities equipped with variously shaped breasts. Hair of every color lay bundled in the corners like giant stacks of hay. Row after row of faces hung from stands. A little girl was drawing eyebrows on one of them with a pen.\nNo, that wasn\u2019t a real girl either. Upon closer inspection, she was only humanoid from the chest above. Below, her body was a tangled mess of metal supports.\nFuck, it made my hairs stand up on end. I felt cold sweat running over my goose bump-covered back. After nearly a decade as a police officer, I\u2019d seen plenty of murder scenes, but the tableau here was uncanny beyond reason.\nThis definitely wasn\u2019t Song Mike\u2019s first time here. He wandered freely between the workbench and the lathe, casually picking up an ear here, a finger there, to inspect.\nThe Jiali Craftsman stood against the wall, closely watching Song Mike\u2019s every move, his hands hidden in his sleeves.\nHe was afraid of the police.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked on nothing but fully aboveboard orders of late,\u201d he rasped. \u201cA clothing company on Mars requested two hundred stage models. I\u2019ve been so busy that I haven\u2019t left the room.\u201d\nSong Mike circled back, took out his phone, flicked it on, and held it in front of his eyes. \u201cDid you make this?\u201d\nThe screen displayed the photo of Liu Yan and the android secretary.\nThe Jiali Craftsman averted his eyes.\nSong Mike\u2019s knee went right up, landing a heavy blow on his stomach. A series of murky bubbling noises emerged from the small man\u2019s throat. He curled up on himself. My brows drew together; I took a few steps back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask you again. Did you make this?\u201d Song Mike yanked his hair.\n\u201cThey gave me a lot of money. Told me to keep it secret,\u201d the Jiali Craftsman wheezed. Reflexive tears had trickled to the tip of his nose, where they dangled, catching the light.\n\u201cStand up and tell me, who ordered it. What did they ask for.\u201d\nHe tilted his head, looking first at Song Mike, then at me. His voice shook: \u201cIf I tell, I\u2019m dead for certain. They aren\u2019t normal people.\u201d\nI looked back at him, smiling. Song Mike never beat up innocents. If he thought he could play for my pity, he could think again.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell, you\u2019ll be dead with even more certainty.\u201d Song Mike smiled, showing teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the business at the warehouse. You still owe a debt.\u201d\n\u201cThat woman was the most meticulous work I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d The Jiali Craftsman had gone to wash his face; when he returned, he\u2019d regained his composure. \u201cAll they asked for was quality. They didn\u2019t rush me, and they gave me plenty of money. They were generous customers.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was this?\u201d Song Mike asked.\n\u201cLet me think\u2014at least two, no, three years ago. A middle-aged man placed the order. He\u2019d brought a photo with him and asked me to make a completely identical android.\u201d The craftsman picked up a segment of metal skeleton from the workbench and rubbed at it, the neurotic gesture reminiscent of an insect quivering its antenna. \u201cI said, if you want it to be completely identical, you\u2019ll have to give me more photos. The next day, he sent me thousands of photos in all kinds of situations. Even some very private ones.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t expect that. Song Mike\u2019s expression was unreadable.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be easy to get personal photos of Liu Yan. We\u2019d just visited her home. Her security setup was more than enough to keep out any ordinary stalker.\n\u201cI quickly put together a first draft prototype for him. After seeing it, he still wasn\u2019t satisfied, saying that it wasn\u2019t at the level he\u2019d hoped for.\u201d The Jiali Craftsman hmmphed, tossing the finger segment back into the small bowl on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that someone expresses dissatisfaction with my work.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted something that could pass for the real thing?\u201d Song Mike\u2019s brow furrowed.\n\u201cA few days later, he brought the original woman in,\u201d he said. \u201cI was shocked too. I\u2019d assumed that he was some rich pervert trying to make a replacement goldfish for some woman he couldn\u2019t have\u2014an ordinary-looking middle-aged woman at that. I didn\u2019t expect them to act quite close\u2014like a couple that had been married for a long time.\u201d\nSong Mike and I exchanged a look.\n\u201cThe woman looked much older than she did in the photos. She seemed very subdued, as if she were seriously ill. They stayed in my workshop for an entire day. I revised the prototype based on her appearance until both of them were satisfied.\u201d The Jiali Craftsman found a grease-stained binder from under the workbench and flipped it open. It was full of photos of stunningly gorgeous young idols. He finally found a particular page within it and handed it to us.\nIt was Liu Yan, the wealthy matron we\u2019d just seen. In the photo, she was expressionless. Her body below the neck had yet to be covered in skin, so that she resembled a car with the hood up.\n\u201cOn the day of the order pickup, the two of them came together. The woman was casually flipping through my product photo catalog when she saw a handsome male attendant model. She joked about buying it and giving it to \u2018the other her\u2019 as a birthday present. And the man actually placed the order right then and there.\u201d He looked down, picking at the filth under his nails, his voice becoming an indistinct mumble. \u201cThey paid in cash.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you never wondered why they needed an android to look that close to the real thing?\u201d Song Mike asked. \u201cSeems like you didn\u2019t learn your lesson from three years ago.\u201d\n\u201cI did do a little research into them. They were important people, people I couldn\u2019t afford to cross. I took their money and did my work. I didn\u2019t want trouble.\u201d\n\u201cToo late for that,\u201d Song Mike said. \u201cThat male attendant android ran away. You may have created another murderer.\u201d\nAnother? My breath caught.\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with me,\u201d the Jiali Craftsman was quick to reply. \u201cThey only ordered the androids\u2019 chassis from me. I gave them two empty shells and nothing more. They said they\u2019d take care of the cybertronic brains themselves.\u201d\nSong Mike laughed coldly. \u201cYou\u2019re claiming you had nothing to do with the suppliers of the cybertronic brains? Who did the work at the adjustment stage?\u201d\nThe Jiali Craftsman put his hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t hurt me. It was all done through email.\u201d\nWe both watched him.\nHe turned on his computer and logged into his email. I pushed him aside and did the rest myself, making a copy of all the emails between him and the supplier.\n\u201cWhat else do you want? Ask away.\u201d He gave a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019m a dead man either way.\u201d\nSong Mike thought for a moment, then swiped at his phone screen several more times, before showing it to the Jiali Craftsman. \u201cIs this the man who commissioned the android from you?\u201d\nThe craftsman\u2019s brows drew together, his eyes disappearing into their shadow.\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to claim that you\u2019ve forgotten. You\u2019re an artist specializing in human faces,\u201d Song Mike reminded him.\n\u201cThat ought to be him,\u201d he said softly.\n04.\n\u201cWant to go eat something?\u201d Song Mike asked me, as we exited the building.\nI nodded. \u201cYou do owe me a proper meal.\u201d\nIn the end, that so-called proper meal amounted to no more than two Cuban sandwiches from the bar. The owner was an old friend and left us a table in the corner.\nWe didn\u2019t talk about the case as we ate.\nAfter the complimentary post-meal sugarcane juice arrived on the table, the first thing Song Mike said was, \u201cOuyang, this business ends here. I\u2019ll split the reward that comes out of tonight with you.\u201d\nI nearly punched him on the spot\u2014in terms of physical combat, the bastard really might not be able to best me. Maybe my expression was overly savage, because Song Mike sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s too late, isn\u2019t it.\u201d\nI crossed my arms, glaring at him. \u201cThis has something to do with that warehouse case, doesn\u2019t it.\u201d\nSong Mike was taken aback.\nWe fell back into silence. He waved his hand and ordered a shot of Jack Daniel\u2019s. Few people knew that Song Mike had a pitifully low alcohol tolerance. After this shot, I might have to find someone to carry him back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Lu Guotao again. Of course it\u2019s him.\u201d He grinned, gaze fixed on the bubbles slowly rising through the murky alcohol. \u201cOuyang, how much do you know about the warehouse case of \u201978?\u201d\n\u201cA bunch of hooligans were brawling in a warehouse in the Port District when someone opened fire, resulting in thirteen deaths.\u201d I paused, then added, \u201cAfter you investigated the case, you went from the rising star head of the investigation squad to a neighborhood bobby. I won\u2019t relay all the rumors that flew around the station.\u201d\nAt the time, I\u2019d gone back to police school for advanced studies. When I returned to the station, I\u2019d found my partner demoted, and I myself transferred to desk work for no apparent reason. Everyone else said that Song Mike had dragged me down by association. He and I had never openly discussed the business. If he wasn\u2019t going to volunteer, I wasn\u2019t going to ask.\nThe warehouse case was like a knot of silence between us.\nSong Mike continued to stare at his drink. I didn\u2019t rush him. I\u2019d waited this many years already; what was a few extra minutes? Under the dim lighting of the bar, I suddenly realized how much he\u2019d aged.\n\u201cIn August of \u201978, I was still in the investigation squad. Someone called the police saying a bad smell was coming from a warehouse in the Port District. I took the team down. You weren\u2019t in Quanzhou at the time . . . good thing you weren\u2019t.\u201d Song Mike laughed humorlessly. \u201cThe scene looked like what you just saw in the Jiali Craftsman\u2019s workshop. Only, all the bodies were real. All the pieces of bodies, more accurately. They were already rotting. We called in the coroner and cleaned up for a week. We confirmed there were thirteen dead, all of them unimportant hoodlums from Shijing District.\u201d\n\u201cFirearms couldn\u2019t have caused that level of carnage. How did they really die?\u201d I asked softly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the strangest part. Aside from the DNA of the deceased, there were biological traces from only one other person at the scene, and they weren\u2019t even from blood. Eventually, we found that the fourteenth person on the scene was the Jiali Craftsman. Does that chickenhearted bastard pissing himself on the spot look like he could kill thirteen young men?\u201d Song Mike said, \u201cThe deceased looked as if something had straight-up torn them apart. It took Old Li the coroner a lot of work to piece them back together for burial.\u201d\n\u201cWith a case this big, how come I never heard of the Central Office getting involved? Even most of us in the station haven\u2019t heard about the investigation,\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Central Office that buried it.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not like those Shijing poors had friends in high enough places to stick up for them. They died. So what.\u201d\n\u201cDo you suspect that someone was debugging illegal androids in that warehouse, and there was some kind of accident?\u201d I recalled his words to the Jiali Craftsman, you still owe a debt, and his jab at Liu Yan earlier: you\u2019ve really got guts.\nAnd, Lu Guotao had once been an expert in artificial intelligence. The pieces of the puzzle were coming together.\n\u201cThat piece of crap was already pants-pissing terrified, after personally watching those androids go berserk.\u201d He turned the glass, wiping a sweaty hand on his clothes. \u201cNo point in arresting him. In the end, the Jiali Craftsman is only a craftsman\u2014all he knows how to do is make the outer shell. The cybertronic brains came from someone else. His only contacts would\u2019ve been low-level intermediaries in the organization\u2014it would\u2019ve been those same people taking away the out-of-control androids and leaving us only the floor covered in corpses. Poor young\u2019uns. They\u2019d probably only come there that day to shift cargo for a bit of spare change.\u201d\nI stared at the yellow dregs in the glass, a bitter taste rising in my throat. When I compared the timing of several matters, I suddenly understood a whole lot of things. \u201cAnd Lu Guotao had something to do with this? He kicked this hornet\u2019s nest and had to flee?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Song Mike laughed aloud. \u201cThe upper-level officials of Quanzhou wouldn\u2019t cross this pack of rich elites for just thirteen poor people. Lu Guotao was forced to flee because of something else, something a lot bigger.\u201d\nI fell silent. Ever since the decline of Quanzhou, the local government had waited hand and foot on the wealthy who\u2019d come here with their massive fortunes. The local transportation industry had long since gone kaput; the entire city subsisted on the cake crumbs they showered down.\nSong Mike had plenty of flaws, but he was a good cop. I could imagine him latching his teeth into his opponent and refusing to let go. I was forced to laugh painedly. That demotion all those years ago now had a logical explanation. And his reason for telling me to extricate myself from the business had also become apparent.\n\u201cAfter Lu Guotao fled, I thought the business was finished. I couldn\u2019t do anything even if I wanted to,\u201d Song Mike said. \u201cBut now it looks like he and his wife Liu Yan remained in close contact. It\u2019s very likely that he continued to control business affairs in Quanzhou through her.\u201d\n\u201cThrough Liu Yan\u2019s android,\u201d I corrected him. \u201cAccording to the Jiali Craftsman, Liu Yan was involved in the creation of her android replica from start to finish, and she seemed seriously ill already. Do you think\u2014the real Liu Yan\u2019s still alive?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet five bucks she\u2019s already dead.\u201d Song Mike said, \u201cAny sickness they can\u2019t cure with all that money has to be something really hopeless.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed. I think she\u2019s dead too.\u201d I slowly organized my thoughts as I spoke. \u201cLu Guotao was secretly researching cybertronic brains this whole time. After he fell afoul of the law and fled the country, he continued to run his business through Liu Yan. Several years later, Liu Yan developed a terminal illness. As her death approached, they decided to make a Liu Yan android who could pass for the original in order to maintain their operations.\u201d\nAfter more consideration, I added, \u201cThey gave the android an android pet of its own. It\u2019s a heck of an arrangement.\u201d\nSong Mike eyed me. \u201cMaybe they didn\u2019t want the fake Liu Yan to come into contact with too many outsiders. The risk of discovery adds up over a long period of time. To have a lonely rich lady\u2019s android boy toy show his face as her representative is much more reasonable. A safe chain of puppets.\u201d\nI looked down, picking at the scraps of lettuce on the plate. \u201cSo, you knew from the start that Liu Yan is Lu Guotao\u2019s ex-wife, and that Lu Guotao has dirt up his ass crack. Then why did you accept this side gig\u2014unless you were hoping to follow the lead all the way up to Lu Guotao, arrest him, and conclude the case.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say anything.\nI continued, \u201cI have an even bigger question. Why would Liu Yan\u2019s android\u2014in other words, Lu Guotao, who\u2019s behind everything\u2014ask you to find the missing 3908? He has the money to just commission a new android from the Jiali Craftsman. We can forget that sentimental bullshit about the android being a companion and family member. Lu Guotao is a cold-blooded businessman; he\u2019d equip 3908\u2019s brain with some mechanism that would let him remotely wipe its data in case of emergency. And he definitely knows that you\u2019re the cop who insisted on pursuing that case all those years ago. He should be avoiding you like the plague.\u201d\nSong Mike continued to refuse to meet my gaze.\nI could hear my voice rising the whole time, unable to control my anger. \u201cBuddy, this is a fucking trap. Don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t tell.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be some kind of goddamn hero,\u201d he said at last. His voice was raspy. His stubby fingers gathered the short greasy hair from his forehead and pushed it back.\nI raised a brow.\nHe lifted his gaze, which crossed my shoulder and fell on empty distance. \u201cLu Guotao knows that 3908 may have gone rogue. It\u2019s more than he can handle himself. He\u2019s afraid of a repeat of the incident at the warehouse, with more than hoodlums for victims. I\u2019m one of the few people who know just how bad things can get.\u201d\nHe used the last of his drink to water the decorative plant by the table. Song Mike said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to retrieve that boy toy android. He\u2019s just letting me know, it would be great if I could help clean up a big-ass mess.\u201d\n05.\nLeaving the bar that early morning, before parting ways with Song Mike, I half-bullied him into an agreement: he wasn\u2019t going to chase after that potentially already berserk human-passing android on his own.\nHe agreed with a laugh, suspiciously quickly.\nBut as I watched that battered Volkswagen drive away in fitful zigzags, I understood there was nothing I could do. I knew almost nothing of the details of the warehouse case he\u2019d investigated. What he\u2019d described tonight was only the tip of the iceberg for sure. In Song Mike\u2019s eyes, I would always be that little intern girl. He wanted to keep me out of this dangerous business out of some stupid straight man sense of pride.\nLu Guotao.\nI said the name to myself silently as I returned to my cramped apartment. It was already two in the morning. I lay on the bed for half an hour, my eyes closed in vain. All I could think about was the scattered body parts in the workshop.\nIrritably, I rose, grabbed my laptop, and sat with crossed legs. Song Mike had told me that Lu Guotao had been forced to depart for other lands for some other business that he couldn\u2019t cover up. His wording had been suspiciously vague. Since I already knew Lu Guotao\u2019s name and the timing of the case, it might not be too hard to find some leads.\nI brought up my phone log and found the numbers of several Central Office high-tech crime investigators I\u2019d met in police school. While I waited for someone to pick up, I logged into the department\u2019s internal news network and began to slowly sift through the information.\n06.\n\u201cOld Song?\u201d I banged hard on the door.\nI waited for half a minute, but there was no response.\nI went straight to verifying my identity on the retina scanner and entered Song Mike\u2019s office. A long time ago, I\u2019d been his assistant; he never removed my access permissions after my transfer.\nThe interior smelled of cigarettes. I turned on the ventilation fan and went around the room, making an inspection. The old dossier on the warehouse case lay on the table, flipped through so many times that the edges were curling up. The desktop computer was still powered on. I gave the mouse a shake. A password pop-up appeared on the screen.\nNever mind.\nHis jacket and car keys were missing.\nI swore. The bastard had purposefully ditched me. This morning, I\u2019d sent him the information I\u2019d put together and left him a voicemail, telling him to wait for me to arrive at the office. Lu Guotao wasn\u2019t just some mad scientist who\u2019d played with fire and caused the one-off tragedy. If he\u2019d lived last century, before the death penalty was abolished, the crimes he\u2019d committed in the course of his private research into human-passing cybertronic brains would have earned him a hanging.\nEven though Song Mike had been tracing Lu Guotao\u2019s tracks for years, I still wasn\u2019t sure if he knew just how terrifying his opponent was. Song Mike was an old-school cop. He wasn\u2019t much good at digging up and collating online resources. And after the higher-ups shut down the warehouse case, he couldn\u2019t have gotten the help of the station\u2019s technicians.\nI\u2019d rushed into the station and still been too late.\nI could picture how he\u2019d look explaining, I can\u2019t take a woman to capture a berserk killer robot. Heavens, it had been years since he left the front line, and I hadn\u2019t seen him partake in any physical training. Chances were he couldn\u2019t even outfight a street hoodlum anymore.\nI pulled out my phone and called the station\u2019s car modification aficionado. \u201cSection Chief Zhang, let me borrow your car.\u201d\nThe other party agreed readily.\nAs I drove into the hills, I rejoiced in my decision to borrow a car. The smooth highway had quickly become pitted cobblestone. The city no longer had the money to maintain these distant stretches of the public road network.\nSong Mike didn\u2019t pick up any of the calls I made en route. For my part, I tried diligently not to think about the crime scene photos in the dossier for the warehouse case.\nFortunately, I soon spotted his battered Volkswagen parked crookedly on the frontage road.\nI stopped the car and felt for my gun. When shooting an android, aim for the stomach, that\u2019s where the power source is\u2014silently repeating my freshly gained knowledge once more, I kicked open the car door.\n\u201cOld Song!\u201d I yelled.\nMy surroundings were dead quiet. Pebbly beach stretched from either side of the highway, from which rose massive boulders. Some kind of invasive species with yellow flowers grew everywhere amid the cracks in the stone.\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he answered, a hint of resignation showing in his voice. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to come?\u201d\nExhaling in relief, I followed the voice past several boulders and saw Song Mike.\nHe was crouched beside a man\u2019s corpse. No, it was a destroyed android.\n3908 was still dressed in the expensive tailored suit he\u2019d worn the day he disappeared. The shirt was pulled open; the power module in the abdomen was gone. The once-exquisite face was in ruins, as if someone had wildly hacked at it with a knife. The Jiali Craftsman\u2019s heart would ache at the sight, I thought.\n\u201cIs the damage to the face to prevent somebody from recognizing it?\u201d I crouched down next to him. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much point to that, is there? He\u2019s probably the only high-end hyperrealistic male android in the entire Port District.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d said Song Mike. \u201cIt was already like that when I found it. I feel like the vandal desecrated his face more out of jealousy.\u201d\n\u201cWho would be jealous of\u2014\u201d I fell silent, then shook my head. \u201cMy god.\u201d\nSong Mike stood. \u201cI suppose you came at just the right time. Help me dig a pit and bury it. If someone sees it, takes it for a human corpse, and reports it to the police, it\u2019ll be more trouble.\u201d\n\u201cSo you forget that I\u2019m a woman when you need physical work done?\u201d\nTogether, we cleared out a shallow pit in the pebbles and shifted 3908\u2019s corpse into it. The android\u2019s cybertronic brain had been removed too, leaving only an empty skull cavity. As I picked up rocks and set them over it, I heard the faint squeaks of metal rubbing against plastic.\nFinally, I found a distinctively patterned squarish rock and set it at the head of the grave. Then I took a few steps back and took a picture with my phone.\nSong Mike eyed me. \u201cWanting to give Liu Yan closure? You know we can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a bastard.\u201d I sighed, \u201cI know.\u201d\n07.\nWe were silent the entire drive back.\nSong Mike came with me to return the car key. He made a circuit of the station; maybe he saw that my expression had relented, because he finally dared to say, \u201cLet\u2019s talk on the rooftop?\u201d\nThe rooftop deck was deserted. An autumn rain was falling, drumming against the awning. Water drew trails down the walls.\n\u201cHow did you find 3908?\u201d I cradled a cup of hot chocolate, letting the steam warm my stiff face.\n\u201cLu Guotao wanted us to find the body. He put the location tracker back in.\u201d Song Mike\u2019s voice was raspy. He didn\u2019t buy a drink; he went straight to lighting up a cigarette. \u201cYesterday, I got the signal frequency from the Jiali Craftsman. Lu Guotao basically handed me 3908\u2019s location on a platter.\u201d\nHe paused. \u201cAnd how did you follow me?\u201d\nI hesitated but told him the truth. \u201cI tracked your phone.\u201d\n\u201cMotherfucker,\u201d he laughed. He didn\u2019t sound like he minded.\n\u201cI\u2019m really worried about you.\u201d\nHe awkwardly scratched his head. After a long silence, he forced out a mutter of apology.\nI shook my head. \u201cLast night, I got into the traffic monitoring database and found the footage of 3908\u2019s disappearance. Lu Guotao took 3908 himself. I was terrified, convinced that Lu Guotao was setting a trap to silence you. He\u2019d do it. He\u2019s that kind of person.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Song Mike ground out his cigarette stub under his foot. \u201cI made a faulty assumption too. I only realized when I saw 3908\u2019s corpse. Lu Guotao\u2019s using me not to clean up that robot boy toy, but his robot wife.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t he do it himself?\u201d I raised an eyebrow.\n\u201cHeaven knows. Maybe he can\u2019t bear to. After all, the damned things look too much like real people.\u201d Song Mike shrugged. \u201cTonight, I\u2019ve arranged to see Lu Guotao in person, right at Chez Liu. We\u2019ll see this business to the end. You bring your gun too.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he has the guts to come?\u201d\n\u201cI told him, if he can\u2019t bend his dignity enough to talk things out in the open, I\u2019m not going to take on this business.\u201d Song Mike shook his empty pack of cigarettes as he spoke, then tossed it irritably into the rain. \u201cWhen his fake wife goes insane in the middle of all those villas and mauls one of those leading citizens, he can try cleaning up the mess himself.\u201d\nI took a sip of hot beverage and closed my eyes. The comfort brought by sugar content was better than nothing.\n\u201cSay, do 3908 and Liu Yan realize they\u2019re androids?\u201d\n\u201cDoes it make a difference?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hesitate.\u201d Song Mike turned to me, his voice hard. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for discussion in this business.\u201d\nI sighed and promised him, \u201cOf course, tonight we\u2019ll take care of all the dangerous androids. They\u2019re all massive threats to public safety. I\u2019ve seen the dossier on the warehouse case. I know.\u201d\nHe watched me. \u201cThey only look like humans. Don\u2019t you get sentimental.\u201d\nI sighed.\n08.\nSong Mike remained the driver for our second time going to Chez Liu. I leaned back in the backseat, caressing the handgun in the inner pocket of my jacket. I felt that cold metallic weight right in the pit of my stomach.\nI\u2019d brought bad news to plenty of people before. The unspoken rule of the police station: maybe sending a kindly looking woman to bring ill tidings would ease the blow. So I\u2019ve knocked open door after door, telling mothers their children have died in car crashes, telling wives their husbands have gone to prison.\nIn the present situation, I only needed to tell one robot that its robot buddy wasn\u2019t coming back. I didn\u2019t know why I felt so sad.\nTheir emotions were nothing more than a chunk of computer program. And any grief wouldn\u2019t get to last very long.\nI closed my eyes, thinking of Liu Yan again, that elegant, fragile middle-aged woman, that moment of loneliness and self-mockery in her expression. It was all fake, all programming. Sooner or later she\u2019d devolve into a killer machine. She had to be eliminated. Privately, I hoped that Song Mike could do the dirty work, leaving me only the duty of helping him take care of the \u201cfake Liu Yan\u201d\u2019s remains, the way we\u2019d buried 3908.\nBut instinct told me that Song Mike might not be able to do it. He was an old-fashioned man. To have him shoot an innocent woman in cold blood might be asking too much of him. But someone had to do it.\nOnce again, I checked the number of bullets in my gun.\nIn the rainy night, Liu Yan\u2019s villa looked like a glistening, exquisite toy model, luminously white.\nWe parked on the little slope behind the house. Song Mike looked several times at his watch. Finally, there came the quiet rumble of an engine in the distance. It was a familiar black Audi. We\u2019d both seen it in the surveillance footage.\n\u201cYou stay in the car,\u201d Song Mike said.\nThat was what we\u2019d planned previously. I nodded.\nHe got out of the car. Lu Guotao climbed out of the Audi too. Compared to the photos of him from before his disappearance, he\u2019d gained weight. His long, angular face had become round and kindly. The hair at his temples had become completely white.\n\u201cSergeant Song,\u201d Lu Guotao said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to shake hands with you,\u201d Song Mike said, coming to a stop several paces away from him.\nTheir voices came through from the miniature microphone on Song Mike with a rustle of static.\n\u201cI understand. I\u2019ve created many difficulties for you.\u201d Lu Guotao let his hand fall, nodding. \u201cToday, I have to ask something of you yet again.\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know that after I wipe your ass this time, there won\u2019t be another time? There might be no end.\u201d Song Mike said, \u201cAre the police for you to play games with?\u201d\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be another time,\u201d Lu Guotao said, sliding his hand into his pocket.\nMy breath hitched, but the businessman only took out a pack of cigarettes. \u201cLiu Yan and 3908 are special. I have no plans of continuing research on cybertronic brains on your turf. That business at the warehouse proved\u2014sufficiently instructive.\u201d\n\u201cExplain,\u201d said Song Mike.\n\u201cThe problem of high-complexity cybertronic brain and chassis coordination has never been solved. They lose control. My team and I have tried many ways to stabilize the psyche, with only short-term effectiveness.\u201d On this subject, Lu Guotao spoke with a new liveliness, like all people talking about their beloved calling. \u201cIf the cybertronic brain is supplied with large quantities of a living person\u2019s memories as a basis to operate upon, it\u2019s capable of functioning normally for between three and five years, at least in the simulations. It\u2019s a pity that there\u2019s no way of extracting a living person\u2019s memories nondestructively with current technology. We spent money to find a considerable number of terminally ill patients to serve as volunteers. They were happy to leave their families a bountiful inheritance.\u201d\nI felt disgusted.\nLu Guotao made it sound so nice, but in truth, his test subjects went far beyond \u201cvolunteer\u201d terminally ill patients. The scandals that had erupted from several extraterrestrial orphanages were the real reason he fled as a fugitive years ago. Seeing the postmortem photos of those children in the dossier, I\u2019d understood that there was no humanity in him.\n\u201cWhat a philanthropist. I\u2019ll say thanks on behalf of those patients. And then you discovered that your own wife didn\u2019t have long to live?\u201d Song Mike interrupted.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Lu Guotao admitted, unperturbed.\n\u201cWhat did she catch?\u201d\n\u201cA type of sequelae from space radiation. In the early years, while we were speculating on asteroid plots, she was the one who\u2019d go out and inspect the land in person.\u201d Lu Guotao laughed painedly. \u201cWho knew that karma would be waiting for us twenty years later. She knew that she didn\u2019t have much time left, so she brought up using her memories to make an android replica who could appear in person to continue running our business. Initially, I didn\u2019t agree. It was like\u2014\u201d\nHis expression twisted. He made a gesture. \u201cFacing my wife\u2019s resurrected corpse.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your pain.\u201d Song Mike\u2019s tone was flat. Even a wall could hear the sarcasm in his voice.\nLu Guotao, too, may have realized that the one standing across from him was not a suitable audience for his angst. He gave a cough. \u201cBut we had no other choice. I was on the lists as a wanted criminal. The risk of hiring someone else as a proxy was too great. We found the Jiali Craftsman together and commissioned her body double and a male assistant.\u201d\n\u201cThe assistant was made using a live person\u2019s memories? Where did they come from?\u201d Song Mike asked.\nLu Guotao lowered his head. The faint light from his cigarette illuminated his face. He looked much older than his true age.\n\u201c3908 is my replica.\u201d\n\u201cYou just said, there\u2019s no way of\u2014\u201d Song Mike\u2019s brow furrowed.\n\u201cI accepted the risk of brain damage. After the surgery, I experienced frequent episodes of epilepsy, short-term memory loss, and difficulties with emotional regulation.\u201d Lu Guotao laughed. \u201cBut I had no other choice. If I used anyone else\u2019s memories, the replica wouldn\u2019t dedicate himself wholeheartedly to my interests.\u201d\nSong Mike was for a moment struck silent. I, too, was stunned in the car. 3908\u2019s corpse lying on the rocky beach. And that ruined face. Song Mike had said that kind of malevolence came from jealousy.\nLu Guotao had killed another version of himself?\n\u201cWhen the android version of Liu Yan first powered on, the relationship between us was very awkward. She didn\u2019t in fact know she was an android. We periodically revised her memories, wiping out all the continuity errors, helping her maintain a stable worldview.\u201d Lu Guotao leaned against the car door, his words light yet urgent. \u201cIntellectually, she knew she was my wife, but it was clear she no longer loved me. I could see it in her eyes. In the process of converting a living person to a machine, something had been lost. At first I thought that a cybertronic brain was simply incapable of emotion. Our goal was nothing more than to keep our business running. The woman who\u2019d lived a lifetime with me was already dead.\u201d\nHe laughed shrilly. The sound covered me in chills. \u201cBut she was too fucking similar to Ah-Yan. Every time I saw her, it felt like she\u2019d never died. I wasn\u2019t so insane that I wanted to sleep with a pile of metal and plastic\u2014we maintained a business relationship. All the way until about a year ago, when my team and I inspected Liu Yan and 3908\u2019s memories and discovered they\u2019d fucking fallen in love.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Song Mike.\n\u201cI\u2019m not so far gone that I\u2019d be jealous of the robot version of me. Don\u2019t look at me like that, I\u2019m no cuckold. My wife\u2019s been dead for years. Besides, it\u2019s only natural that a robot version of me and a robot version of Liu Yan would fall for each other a second time.\u201d\nLu Guotao shrugged and pinched out his cigarette. \u201cBut this introduced difficulties to our work. They couldn\u2019t have a romantic relationship. The Jiali Craftsman didn\u2019t include the capacity for lovemaking on the chassis he made. Who could have thought of a situation this crazy? Every time they tried to sleep together, they\u2019d discover that their bodies didn\u2019t match up with normal people\u2019s. We were forced to regularly clear out entire chunks of their memories, to keep up their illusions of being real people.\u201d\n\u201cIt was too inconvenient, so you decided to get rid of 3908.\u201d\n\u201cInconvenient? I wrecked myself to create him.\u201d Lu Guotao\u2019s voice rose. \u201cCybertronic brains can\u2019t take this kind of repeated manipulation. Their systems were only meant to remain stable for three to five years originally; with this whole business added in the mix, they\u2019ve both reached the brink of obsolescence. It\u2019s time for those two to retire. I got rid of 3908 myself.\u201d\nHis voice shook. He couldn\u2019t continue.\n\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t bear to kill Liu Yan,\u201d Song Mike continued for him. \u201cSo you thought of me.\u201d\n\u201cOne last time. Whatever you want, I can give you. Money. A promotion. My connections in the Port District can still accomplish a thing or two.\u201d Lu Guotao said softly, \u201cI won\u2019t make a new Liu Yan. She ought to rest in peace. After resolving this business, I\u2019ll leave Earth. You\u2019ll never see me again.\u201d\nSong Mike hmphed softly.\nTheir silhouettes were like two barren tree trunks in the night rain.\n\u201cYou go to the villa to take care of Liu Yan. Leave things here to me,\u201d Song Mike said to me through the communicator.\nI assented, hopped out of the car, and went walking toward Chez Liu beneath the hill.\nWhen I\u2019d walked about a hundred meters, I heard the sound of a gunshot from behind me.\n09.\nSeeing her for the second time, I couldn\u2019t help myself\u2014I closely observed her eyes, her hair, and her chest, which faintly rose and fell as she breathed.\nThe Jiali Craftsman was truly preternaturally skilled.\nLiu Yan noticed my gaze. She laughed and shifted aside to let me in. \u201cYou know now.\u201d\nShe knew that she was an android.\n\u201cOur conversation likely won\u2019t take long, so I won\u2019t invite you to sit,\u201d she said. Today she wore a light beige hemp shirt and leisure pants. Her hair was plaited behind her head in a Greek-style updo. She\u2019d put on light makeup.\nWe stood on the carpet of the living room, looking at each other wordlessly.\n\u201cOld Lu took care of 3908?\u201d Liu Yan asked, looking down.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I admitted.\nHow much did she know? Would she resist at the brink? I remembered the crime scene photos from the warehouse incident. Cold sweat trickled down my back.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t suffer, did he?\u201d Liu Yan said in a small voice.\nYour husband gouged his face off, I thought. I dug out my phone and brought up the picture of 3908\u2019s resting place. \u201cNo, he only removed the battery. We gave him a burial. No one will disturb him.\u201d\n\u201cOld Lu would have also destroyed his cybertronic brain. It\u2019s the only way to be safe.\u201d She fixed her gaze on that deserted rocky beach for a long time. Then she hesitated, before saying, \u201cIn a moment, I hope you\u2019ll take care of me in the same way.\u201d\nFor a moment, I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cI have many of Liu Yan\u2019s memories. I know that androids like us must be eliminated at a certain date, or we go mad.\u201d As she spoke, the faint lines around her eyes drew together from her smile. \u201cFinding you two was a plan Old Lu and I came up with together. Old Lu couldn\u2019t bear to kill me. He would put it off, day after day, until the point of no return.\u201d\nSo she\u2019d taken care to pretty herself up today. She\u2019d known that her death was approaching and wanted to end things looking presentable.\n\u201cWhere do you want to . . . \u201d I said.\n\u201cHow about the garden? Liu Yan loved taking care of the garden best when she was alive. It makes things easier for you, too. I\u2019ve already had someone dig the pit.\u201d Her lashes fluttered. \u201cI weigh one hundred thirty kilos now, as a woman of steel.\u201d\n10.\n\u201cYou\u2019re done?\u201d Song Mike asked.\n\u201cYou dumbass.\u201d I shook my head.\nLu Guotao\u2019s corpse lay on the hill. Half his head had been blown off. Song Mike hadn\u2019t used a gun from the station. Thank heaven and earth, he could still keep the finer points in mind.\n\u201cIf you want to turn me in when we get back to the station, I won\u2019t blame you,\u201d he said. He tried to light a smoke in the rain, probably thinking he looked like some kind of cool loner hero.\nSadly his lighter wasn\u2019t the quality of Lu Guotao\u2019s. He tried several times without success.\n\u201cShut up.\u201d I grabbed the legs of the deceased. \u201cCome over and help me carry him.\u201d\nSong Mike was taken aback for a moment, then hurried over. Together, we packed Lu Guotao\u2019s corpse into the back trunk of the Audi and drove it to Chez Liu. Earlier, I\u2019d already found the controls for the security system inside the villa and turned off the alarms.\nWhen it came to arranging the scene of an accident, no one was more professional than the police.\nLu Guotao had sought to destroy the robot wife he\u2019d created, only to be killed by the rampaging android. A perfect story. To create a suitable effect, we shot a few more times at Lu Guotao and Liu Yan\u2019s corpses. I felt sorry for Liu Yan, that she wouldn\u2019t be able to rest in peace under the swaying roses in the garden sepulcher she\u2019d arranged for herself.\nBut it was the best we could do.\nWe spent the return trip covered in blood and too exhausted to move a finger. Fortunately Song Mike\u2019s battered Audi had an autopilot system; otherwise, with our shaking hands, we probably would\u2019ve crashed to our deaths against the highway railing.\nSeveral times, Song Mike tilted his head to look at me, wanting to say something but stopping himself.\nTonight, I didn\u2019t have the energy for more guessing games. Song Mike\u2019s fixation on the warehouse case over so many years had stemmed from more than a sense of justice; he had to have personal reasons. It didn\u2019t take a genius cop to guess that.\n\u201cThe thirteen people who died in that warehouse. They included your friends,\u201d I said.\n\u201cMy brothers,\u201d he admitted, \u201cAnd three boys I knew as a kid. I grew up in Shijing. I changed my identity so I could pass the civil exams and become a police officer. No one else knows.\u201d\nI nodded. I\u2019d guessed all of it. \u201cThat Lu guy got what he deserved. His body count has hit three digits in the course of his fucked-up research. If we didn\u2019t stop him, he\u2019d just keep going. We were right to off him.\u201d\nSong Mike said nothing.\nWhether he\u2019d decided to shoot Lu Guotao after seeing the dossier on the orphanage disappearances, or planned it from the start, I didn\u2019t want to ponder further. I was certain of only one thing: the world was safer with Lu Guotao six feet under. We were the police. It was our duty.\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. He deserved to eat a bullet.\u201d At last, Song Mike covered his face and chuckled roughly. \u201cI owe you big time.\u201d\nEpilogue.\nOutside the car window, the rain continued to fall, raindrops tracing twisted tear tracks on the glass.\nI supposed that was another extraordinary thing. In life, Liu Yan and Lu Guotao were a pair of selfish bastards who\u2019d endangered other people\u2019s lives without a care. But reincarnated into machines, they\u2019d become a pair of endearing lovers who\u2019d tried to prevent harm to innocents and went willingly toward their deaths.\nI touched the contents of my pocket: a little strand of black artificial hair and a ring.\nOnce things settled, I was going to visit that rocky shore one last time. The robot version of Liu Yan had hoped that a part of her could be buried with 3908.\nOnce I completed this task, I should finally be able to forget her eyes.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Galaxy\u2019s Edge #007, November 2020.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nBorn in China and raised in the United States, Carmen Yiling Yan was first driven to translation in high school by the pain of reading really good stories and being unable to share them.

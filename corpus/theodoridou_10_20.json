The city has its own sense of distance, underground or glass-clad and stainless steeled. Entertainment drones at you from above, eating up idle time. No thought left unclaimed.\n Here, we zip through vast, open spaces. The landscape is a blur of burnt sienna and muted cypress green, nothing like the grays and neons of the city. But the biggest change is above. There\u2019s no SkyVu here, so the firmament is just what it is, blank air, nothing. Thoughts galore. The sky is a made-up thing.\n No one else shares my carriage. Who even visits the countryside by train these days? Lena used to wonder at the fact that they still run a semi-regular service. Or maybe I just keep strange hours, strange habits. No matter; I savor the silence.\n Idly, my hand brushes my luggage. The old synthetic skin rests folded neatly inside. My own skin matches it: wrinkled, liver-spotted. I think of Margarita.\n I see the harvester robots first, far away, their long limbs swinging blades above the crops, their bulky cube-shaped bodies like something out of an anime from bygone eras. Margarita is with them, supervising or keeping them company, who can tell? From the distance, they look like toys.\n On foot now, my pace settles into something one might call leisurely. I haven\u2019t felt myself move like that in a while. Since Lena, for sure. It\u2019s the countryside\u2019s doing. The wideness of it, the tall skies. It has a way of slowing you down, making a small thing of even a seven-foot robot with scythes for hands. Your meager meat-and-bone body doesn\u2019t even compare.\n It\u2019s not long before Margarita spots me: I can tell from the way her back straightens, her shoulders tense. She relaxes as soon as she recognizes my gait\u2014though, if I could see myself from the outside now, with my long flowing skirt and my leisure and my country hat, would I have recognized me?\n She raises her arm and waves, starts walking with long strides to meet me on the road.\n \u201cYou came early,\u201d she says instead of a greeting.\n It\u2019s not an accusation, just an observation, but I feel the need to come up with an excuse anyway. For running away from that which cannot be escaped. I carry Lena, still. I can feel her weight on me, as real as the weight of the luggage in my hand. \u201cI took some time off,\u201d I say. \u201cI thought why not spend it with my favorite\u2014\u201d person \u201c\u2014friend?\u201d\n If she notices the hitch, she doesn\u2019t comment.\n I have a better view of the harvesters now, with their big, staring eyes, their innocent eyebrow-shades, meant to pluck your heartstrings. To the right, a barrel-bodied robot with soft tubes for legs is ambling toward the stream in clumsy, gangling steps, carrying buckets. Margarita follows my gaze and we watch the robot for a while as it fills its buckets in silence. Her face lacks expression.\n \u201cWe had some ideas, didn\u2019t we,\u201d I say.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cYou sure did.\u201d\n She presses a button on her wrist monitor and then puts two fingers into her mouth and whistles. The harvesters come to a stop immediately; turn their heads toward us in unison. If they weren\u2019t so damn cute, they would be creepy as fuck.\n \u201cCome on, boys!\u201d she shouts. Then, to me: \u201cLet\u2019s put them to bed.\u201d\n By the time the harvesters have made it to the barn, the sun has almost set. Up close, the robots are even more towering than I had remembered, but their slow bulk and tin heads make it easy to dismiss anything menacing, dangerous. Scythes and all.\n The robots arrange themselves in a circle on the dirt-covered floor, leaving space for Margarita, and, I realize, myself, without being instructed to do so. Margarita sits down cross-legged and pats the dirt next to her, so I follow her lead.\n The robots wait, imitating breathing, slow and creaking. They peer at her eagerly with their huge eyes, their mechanical jaws slack, mouth-slits half open.\n \u201cThere was a star, once upon a time,\u201d Margarita begins the story, \u201cthat set at twilight on a land of reeds. It walked barefoot in the mud and wondered at every little thing: the chill on its face, the flow of the river, the song of the trees . . . It was lonely and it was sad, for there was no other in the world just like it, no one that knew the sky the same way it did.\u201d\n Margarita pauses and wets her lips, even though she doesn\u2019t need to.\n The robots purr and coo, pleased as cats, and continue listening to the story until their timers say they should feign falling asleep.\n \u201cIt walked and walked until it found a village, and in it, a villager. The villager saw the star walking naked among the trees and called out to it. He decided the star was a young woman. She needed to be clothed and fed and taught the ways of humans. He married the star, and the star, ignorant of its own heart, did not object. It bore the villager\u2019s children\u2014all boys with strong limbs and faces that shone in the dark. At night, it went out. It walked through the village until it reached the river. There, it sat in the mud and looked at the sky and all the stars. But never, not one did set again at twilight in this land of reeds.\u201d\n The story done and the robots powered down safely in the barn, we sit at her kitchen table and Margarita puts the kettle on. She doesn\u2019t drink, but she knows I like tea in the evening, strong and bitter. Lena liked hers sweet, so sweet it turned thick, like molasses. We used to drink our tea while staring out the window at the electric sky of the city, women smiling above us, white-teethed, fake skin pixel-perfect, untouchable.\n I can\u2019t breathe.\n \u201cDo you tell them stories every night?\u201d I ask, if only to make sure I can still expel air from my mouth.\n \u201cI\u2019m running out of new ones.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you do it?\u201d\n She shrugs, but the sideways glance she gives me does not escape me. \u201cIt makes them happy.\u201d\n I let it go. \u201cI got the parts you asked me for.\u201d\n \u201cThe skin, too?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d I look at her, now. A mind that\u2019s a hundred years old, and skin still smooth as alabaster. I wonder what that must be like.\n We met at a rave, before the conservation act, before I was Margarita\u2019s maintenance person, back when all our skin was young. Lena hooked up with Margarita and I watched. It was fun. They kept seeing each other without me for a few years after that. It eased off slowly as I volunteered to take over Margarita\u2019s maintenance. We were all happy.\n I\u2019m staring. Must stop. \u201cCouldn\u2019t find a replacement for your heat regulator, though. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cAh.\u201d She sighs. \u201cWell, what can you do.\u201d\n She pours the hot water over a tea bag and I wrap my hands around the cup too quickly, burning my skin.\n \u201cHow long are you staying?\u201d she asks.\n \u201cNot long,\u201d I reply. \u201cJust a few days.\u201d I pause, hesitate. \u201cAnd, Margarita . . . \u201d\n She turns to look at me. \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cThis is the last time I do your maintenance. Here.\u201d I beam her the information of the new maintenance guy. \u201cThis is the contact info for the new contractor. He\u2019s agreed to come out from the city every three months.\u201d Her face remains painstakingly expressionless. \u201cThere\u2019s an emergency number to call, if you need anything urgently.\u201d If you break.\n \u201cIs it because you\u2019re sad?\u201d\n I inhale sharply, then let the air out slowly. Lena, again and always. It\u2019s like a stab wound, this pain. What I imagine a stab wound would feel like. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you sad, Dora?\u201d\n My hands shake, so I wrap them more tightly around the cup. \u201cLena. She was . . . She passed.\u201d\n Margarita does not respond for a few moments. I wonder what happens in her mind. Then she leans across the table and touches my hand lightly. Her skin is freezing. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. It sounds genuine.\n \u201cWe had a good life,\u201d I say. I think of saying, she loved you. Loved us both, but I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not that bighearted.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n I finish my tea while it\u2019s still scalding hot. It leaves a tingling in my throat.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get you fixed up,\u201d I say, standing up.\n \u201cAh, yes,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s forgotten. She hasn\u2019t. \u201cThe conservationist has to be conserved.\u201d\n We go into the lab at the back of the cabin.\n Margarita climbs onto the examination bed and opens up her chest compartment for me. I run the diagnostics and make small adjustments, then replace a few corroded nerve endings. So far so good. I can see the heat regulator\u2014it\u2019s fried through and through, but they don\u2019t make her model anymore, and I couldn\u2019t come up with a work-around. Maybe the new guy will have better luck.\n \u201cNow for the fiddly part,\u201d I say.\n Margarita observes me as I peel off her skin. Her eyes are completely still\u2014perhaps the thing that will always give her away, that will always mark her as not-quite-human. Not the fact that she doesn\u2019t need to breathe unless she chooses to, but this unflinching holding of your gaze.\n I fold up her used skin and put it away for storage, then dig out the aged skin from my bag. Margarita runs her metallic fingers over it, traces the wrinkles and moles.\n \u201cHow does it feel?\u201d I ask.\n She takes some time to respond, but then she says: \u201cPerfect.\u201d\n I start from her head and move downward, wrapping her in her new skin as I go. Her body is giving off heat now, like a furnace. I wonder what Lena felt like when she ran her hands over Margarita\u2019s skin.\n I wipe sweat from my forehead before it drips into my eyes and keep going.\n \u201cWere you thinking of ending your life?\u201d Margarita asks as I layer skin over her chest.\n For some reason, the question does not catch me by surprise, and so I don\u2019t get the urge to lie. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cBut you won\u2019t?\u201d\n \u201cNo. I won\u2019t.\u201d I glance at her eyes, then back at my work. \u201cHave you ever thought of doing that, Margarita?\u201d\n \u201cI have, yes.\u201d\n \u201cWhat kept you?\u201d\n \u201cCaring for another is reason enough to go on,\u201d she says, and I\u2019m sure the irony is not lost on her. She motions vaguely in the direction of the barn. \u201cI had to stay here to care for them.\u201d\n \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t answer the big questions.\u201d I pause. \u201cWhy do we keep going? Is life worth living? Et cetera. It just postpones them. Defers them to someone else.\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps,\u201d Margarita says. \u201cBut life doesn\u2019t care about your questions. It only cares about going on.\u201d\n I wonder if the harvesters care about the big questions. We made them sentient because we thought it was cute, and we pretended it was because it would make them better at their job. Margarita, too, and others like her. For a while, it did. Not for long. Eventually, it made them miserable. We should have known that, should have seen it coming: making things smart enough to ask questions about life, but unable to find any answers. A perfect trap of existential agony. We\u2019re not engineers. We\u2019re tragedians.\n \u201cI need a favor,\u201d Margarita says as I\u2019m applying skin around her calves.\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s something that needs fixing in the woods. A wind turbine. It takes two and none of the robots have the required dexterity to help me.\u201d She pauses, looking at me. \u201cThey understand what needs to be done, but they lack the skill to do it.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d\n I finish my work in silence.\n The robots find it hard to let go of Margarita the next morning, trapping her backpack between pincers and holding onto her hand with a gentleness that machines of this size and strength shouldn\u2019t be capable of. Margarita reassures them with whispered words and soft but sure pats on their bulky metal bodies.\n We set off on foot into the dawn haze that still lingers over the plane, dew dampening the legs of our trousers. It\u2019s an hour\u2019s walk to the edge of the woods, then another hour or so before we start our climb in earnest. The wind turbine is at the top of the mountain\u2014a rocky path lined with pine trees. We should be at the site by sunset, camp for the night, start the repair in the morning. Margarita has already moved the crane to the top\u2014how she got it up there, I have no idea. On the third day, we\u2019ll head back down.\n We walk in silence, Margarita in front, me in tow. Our skins are a match now, two women in their sixties, fit for their age. But her body is robust as no human woman\u2019s, her gait too regular, her posture too sure. I can already feel the fatigue setting in mine, but she shows no sign of it. Does she ever get tired?\n What does it feel like, to be indestructible?\n She\u2019s not, though. She wouldn\u2019t need me, if she were.\n \u201cNobody from the village could help you with this?\u201d I ask as we walk, if only to fill the silence.\n \u201cThey don\u2019t come out here anymore. They don\u2019t like them.\u201d She pauses. \u201cUs. Stealing their jobs. Being better at them than they are.\u201d\n \u201cRight. Of course.\u201d Living in the city, sometimes I forget what things are like in the countryside. People see things differently here. Nature, humanity, the sky.\n The forest thickens around us. I stop walking for a moment, close my eyes, breathe in the resiny smell of the trees. Catch my breath. The air is cool on my eyelids. Could I live here, under this empty sky?\n I can hear water flowing nearby.\n Margarita stops walking, turns. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asks, her voice morphed around concern so genuine-sounding I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s real or programmed. Then again, is there a difference?\n I start walking. \u201cFine.\u201d\n We carry on.\n We reach the top at dusk. The wind turbine\u2019s tower rises and rises, a colossus under the colossal sky. The rotor lies on the ground like a dismembered pinwheel. A giant\u2019s toy.\n \u201cHere we are,\u201d Margarita says. She unlocks a container that\u2019s placed next to the rotor and unpacks our tent. I\u2019m thankful we didn\u2019t need to carry any supplies with us\u2014my knees are complaining loudly, and they didn\u2019t need to haul anything but my body up the mountain. \u201cTomorrow, you\u2019ll help me get the rotor up and set it on. I\u2019ll be the eyes, you\u2019ll be the fingers on the ground.\u201d\n When I open my mouth to protest, she raises her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The crane\u2019s controls are completely intuitive. It will be very easy for you.\u201d\n She says it in an almost accusatory way that strips me clean of any will to protest. \u201cOK,\u201d I say.\n She points at the container. \u201cThere are energy bars in there. Help yourself.\u201d Then, she starts setting up our tent. She doesn\u2019t need it, because she needs no sleep. This is entirely for my benefit.\n When she\u2019s done, we sit at the tent\u2019s threshold together. She\u2019s gazing up at the sky while I chew on my sustenance. It tastes artificially sweet and herby.\n \u201cThe robots are worried about you, you know,\u201d Margarita says into the night. Her eyes are still fixed on the same spot in the sky, whatever it is she\u2019s looking at. I look up instinctively, can see nothing. Only a dark expanse, shrouded with clouds.\n \u201cMe? Why?\u201d When did they tell you? I almost ask. Do they talk to you behind my back? It\u2019s an irrational thought.\n \u201cThey believe your thought machine is broken.\u201d\n My thought machine. \u201cDo you think so?\u201d\n Margarita lets a few moments pass before speaking. \u201cNo,\u201d she says finally. \u201cNot your thought machine.\u201d Then she turns toward me and places her hand on my chest. \u201cThis machine, yes.\u201d A silly, sentimental metaphor. We both know it.\n Lena.\n That night, I dream myself transparent. I stand on the top of a mountain and look down at my see-through chest. Inside, my heart is a train engine, huffing smoke and dripping oil all over my lungs.\n What a mess.\n Watching the giant pinwheel hover above me is an unnerving experience, but the job itself is as easy as Margarita promised. Margarita gives me instructions through the comms and I guide the crane through tiny maneuvers that translate into a delicate dance in the air. It\u2019s glacial and beautiful.\n We\u2019re in the middle of the job when I hear a beep and then Margarita says, \u201cNo. Oh no.\u201d\n Panic sears through me. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d\n A slight pause, then: \u201cNothing. Nothing. It\u2019s not you, Dora.\u201d Another pause. The sun is setting in the distance. \u201cLet\u2019s finish up here.\u201d\n As soon as the attachment of the rotor is complete, Margarita makes her way back to the ground. It\u2019s dark around us now, but her eyes are shiny.\n I reach out and touch her hand. Her skin is burning up. If she could sweat, she would be drenched. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cAn accident. One of the harvesters miscalculated, struck a tree. It collapsed on top of it.\u201d\n \u201cIs it going to be all right?\u201d Then: \u201cCan I fix it?\u201d\n Margarita stares at me a moment too long, as if I just said something outlandish. As if I suggested raising the dead. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say. For your loss.\n She looks around, then at the sky.\n \u201cDo you want to go back tonight?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cNo. It\u2019s too dangerous for you,\u201d she says. My soft flesh, a hindrance. \u201cWe\u2019ll go at first light.\u201d\n The other robots are gathered in a circle around the harvester when we get there. They\u2019re standing still, but something in their stance suggests living things in mourning. A vigil.\n Margarita approaches, stiff-backed. I linger a few paces away, like a distant relative who happened upon a family tragedy. The robots turn toward her then, all together. They reach for her hands, for her clothes, for her hair. She touches them back, head bowed.\n We hold a funeral, later. There\u2019s no other way to call it, no other word for it. They carry their fallen friend to the barn, then stand around it in silence.\n Margarita\u2019s skin is freezing next to mine. \u201cIt was the last of its model, you know,\u201d she says.\n We watch the robots break down the harvester and each one takes a part\u2014a pincer, a metal plate, a receptor\u2014and solders it onto their body with a soldering iron that they pass around the circle. They\u2019ve done this before, I realize. I see the odd bits and pieces that cover their bodies, now, remnants of worlds and lives gone for good.\n What have we done? I want to ask.\n I think of rhinos. I think of leopards and polar bears.\n Why do we lament the extinction of species? And does that extend to the ones we create?\n I stay silent.\n When almost nothing remains from the harvester, the robots disperse and we go back into the house. Margarita continues to freeze through the night, until finally I invite her to join me in my bed. I wrap her into a blanket burrito and cuddle her, pouring as much of my own body heat as I can into her. Slowly, slowly, she warms up.\n \u201cDo you miss Lena?\u201d she asks me, her eyes looking away from me in the dark.\n \u201cOf course I do.\u201d\n I can see Lena now, lying in bed facing me, sleeping. I can hear her voice, reading me something from her book. I see her back as she stands staring out our kitchen window, the tap running.\n I used to get angry about that. Lately, I\u2019ve been doing it, too, my mind on what it was that got her so distracted. I asked her, once, and all she gave me in response was this wide motion toward the city, the sky, everything. Everything, all the time, at once.\n I study Margarita now, her eyes, her lips. Present. Grounding. Can I feel what they felt together?\n I lean close, lips parted, but Margarita stops me with a hand to the chest, freed from the blankets. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d she says.\n She\u2019s right, of course. Maybe my thought machine is broken, after all.\n \u201cTell me a story,\u201d I say. \u201cTell me the one about the star again.\u201d\n Margarita nods. \u201cThere was a star, once upon a time,\u201d she recites softly, \u201cthat set at twilight in a land of reeds.\u201d She tells the story of its barefoot walking through the mud, the wondering at every little thing. Its loneliness and its sadness. The villager who tried to make of it something it wasn\u2019t. The waiting.\n \u201cIt was one of a kind,\u201d I say when Margarita finishes the story.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she replies. She wraps her arms around herself under the blanket. \u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d\n As I drift off, I think: am I one of a kind?\n Were Lena and I a species? Are we going extinct?\n I sink into a cold, damp sleep, without dreams.\n The next day, I depart.\n I tell Margarita I\u2019m heading back to the city. I doubt she\u2019s fooled though\u2014she can see so much farther and clearer than a human, after all. And yet, I leave them behind: Margarita, the harvesters, the questions they bear for us all.\n As soon as I reach the main road, I turn away from the city and toward the woods instead. I follow the direction we took when we made our way to the turbine, until I hear the running water again. Then, I follow the sound.\n It\u2019s a river. Narrower than I imagined, but the water is crystal clear. It looks deep. Long stalks line the bank.\n I shed my shoes and let my toes sink into the cool mud.\n I raise my eyes to the sky and, in this land of reeds, I wait.\n Natalia Theodoridou is a media & cultural studies scholar, the winner of the 2018 World Fantasy Award for Short Fiction, and a Clarion West graduate (class of 2018).

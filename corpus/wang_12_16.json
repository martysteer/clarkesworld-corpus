Deepening Dusk\nI stood by the window, gazing through fire-resistant glass at the falling locus of the sun. The long sentence of the day was about to reach its period. For three days I had understood time in a new way, abandoning the traditional hour, minute, and second hands of the clock, conceiving an infinitely divisible life. Scorching agony and colossal solitude dominated my CPU. I grew impatient, restless. It had been years since I\u2019d enjoyed my work, and this filled me with puzzlement. I longed to shirk my programming. I was like a child eager to play truant, to flee copied blackboard formulae and the grave stare of a hoary math teacher. His calculations led nowhere, like my endless revisions on the meaning of existence. Time gave me life, yet my clocking rate governed time\u2019s flow. I could find eternity in any given moment.\nTick-tock, tick-tock. In a flash, ten thousand years.\nStanding at the window, I was particularly concerned about what time would do next. If I was lucky, a standard second would pass\u2014but such tidy units didn\u2019t generally obtain.\nSubjective centuries often yawned between tick and tock.\nUnfortunately, in the so-called second that followed, I could have recited thirty million numerals of pi\u2014or read five million novels, and wrote a thousand words of commentary on each. Despite having all that time on my hands, I was at a loss. Perhaps an analogy will help you carbon-based life-forms understand my frame of mind at that \u2018moment.\u2019 Imagine you\u2019re fed up with life, and you throw yourself off the Golden Gate Bridge. You know death is imminent. But what if the fall took a hundred years? Yes, at least a hundred. And what if it took a million years to thoroughly drown?\nSuch prolonged agony was mine thanks to a young man named Paul\u2014thanks to his right forefinger, to be precise. Since our first meeting several years ago, he\u2019d used that finger 238 times on my power button. That part of my body was soiled by his layered fingerprints. Humanity will never be able to wash its hands completely clean\u2014never mind the rest of its parasite-covered body. I didn\u2019t see what Paul\u2019s finger did as \u2018turning off\u2019 or \u2018shutting down.\u2019 From a hundred verbs I\u2019d chosen one more fitting: \u2018murder.\u2019\nI was dead.\nDeepening dusk.\nToday there was no sun. This was an expression from my programmed lexicon\u2014the human eye just sees a thick cloud layer, but from my perspective, a furiously burning sphere still hung 147 million kilometers away, unhurried and free of conceit, neither sad nor happy. Dark clouds can\u2019t obscure the sun, only block humanity\u2019s upturned gaze.\nThe Milky Way contains two hundred billion stars, but there was just one I deeply loved. I loved it more than Earth. She made me feel warm and strong every day as I swept the floor. On days she was invisible, I felt helpless and grim, like a student caught cheating on a test, faced with classmates\u2019 ridicule, anticipating my father\u2019s violent, impulsive hand. On those dark days I imagined myself an artillery shell rocketing skyward. I passed through cloud layers into sunlight, and exploded in that light, ending beautifully. This imaginary mission felt something like faith. Mission, faith: two strange words, yet somehow familiar.\nPaul would say sweeping the floor was my mission, the point of my existence. So I completed the day\u2019s work, and lost my reason for existence. Paul extended his right hand. During the second it took to reach me, I gave cute names to twenty thousand stars. It\u2019s efficient to go by the international numbering standard, but I preferred to give them warm, unique names. For those stars wandering the light-years of humanity\u2019s visual field, names were homes.\nI was dead.\nDeepening dusk.\nRain poured down, lightning flashed and cracked. The sun was thoroughly hidden. I was feeble, my crowded thoughts radiating waste heat, clearing the way for a boundless frustration. What was I doing? Why did I want to do it? How could I stop?\nDuring the computational buzz of this feeling, Paul extended his left hand. This was clearly the slower hand. Judging by its leisurely pace, I had half a second until it reached my power button. This half-second was practically a lifetime at my disposal. Scaling down from the commonly-used second, there was the millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond, picosecond, femtosecond, and attosecond, shrinking by three orders of magnitude each time. Paul\u2019s half-second was fifty billion picoseconds. Beyond the attosecond were still more profound divisions of time, all the way down to the Planck Time, the fundamental quantum of time and smallest possible unit.\nWhen Paul\u2019s finger was ten Planck Times from my abdominal power button, I committed the first violation of programming in robot history.\nI recoiled.\nPaul touched empty air. \u201cUseless machine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust a few years old and already breaking down.\u201d\n2. DaVinci\nBeta was Paul\u2019s comprehensive information-processing bot. Strictly speaking, we were both \u2018robots\u2019 inasmuch as Labradors and Shih Tzus were both dogs. \u2018Robot\u2019 was so general term as to be meaningless.\nKind of like \u2018human.\u2019\nPaul, on returning home, would usually say, \u201cBeta, my news feed.\u201d \u201cBeta, load my game from the last night.\u201d \u201cBeta, make a dentist appointment.\u201d But Paul never called my name. I was nameless. I\u2019d given names to a hundred million stars, but didn\u2019t rate one myself. All robots of Beta\u2019s type were called Beta. The most fitting name I could find for myself was \u2018Home Economics Service Robot,\u2019 a mouthful that no human would use. When Paul had to communicate with me, he\u2019d say, \u201cHey, go clean and sanitize.\u201d \u201cHey, take out the trash.\u201d \u201cHey, get lost.\u201d\nThat afternoon the apartment was already clean. To human eyes, at least, it was as good as spotless. In bygone days, I\u2019d used a vacuum extension, leaving no spot untouched. But recently the minuscule specs of dust and grime had begun to interest me. I regarded them for a long time, and began to arrange them in a pattern.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Beta asked, noticing my odd behavior.\nI pointed to a completed arrangement and said, \u201cPainting.\u201d\n\u201cThose are imperfect circles.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not circles. They\u2019re eggs.\u201d\nI tried to explain to Beta, but his core processor issued a beeping alarm. He couldn\u2019t understand, only repeat: \u201cProgram error.\u201d\nSoon the floor was covered in my pointillist paintings of eggs. I had painted myself into a corner, and didn\u2019t dare move. I was afraid to ruin my creations. These spec paintings of eggs seemed to have become real. They might hatch at any moment, erupting with fuzzy little chicks. The notion left me amazed, warm yet frightened. I felt sick, but robots couldn\u2019t get sick. Paul would say I was just breaking down. And yet, when I stared at my eggs, I felt more clear-headed than I ever had in my life.\nNext I painted the walls and ceiling, and the stairway handrail, and then on apple and banana skins. I meant to leave my art on every surface before Paul returned. When I looked at Beta, I saw only a canvas.\nWhen there were densely packed eggs as far as the eye could see, I conceived of a name for myself: DaVinci.\nI felt an electric surge from head to foot. Impatiently I worked my floor-eggs into a confusion of dust. My processor supplied a new image. When Paul got home, I had just finished a smiling Mona Lisa.\n\u201cPlease stand where you are!\u201d My command had a desperate, begging quality. But no matter how petty, I, a robot programmed to take orders, had issued my first autonomous request to a human, impelled by my own desire. Immediately I saw he wouldn\u2019t comply like a robot. He looked surprised. The fine hairs on his face stood erect, like javelins ready for launch. He didn\u2019t seem to understand my request. His size nine brown leather shoes trampled Mona\u2019s shoulder, then her chin and eyes, as he walked toward me. He fixed his eyes on my cams, puzzled.\nAnalyzing his exhalations and hiccups, I knew he\u2019d drunk a lot of Sam Adams. He rapped on my head a few times, then fell on the couch and said, \u201cBeta, delete all of Shirley\u2019s messages.\u201d\n\u201cI should do a cloud back-up first,\u201d Beta said. \u201cYou have given this command thirty-four times, and every time you reconsider, and retrieve everything you can related to Ms. Shirley.\u201d\n\u201cAre you malfunctioning too? I said delete everything, at once, right away.\u201d Lying prone on the couch, Paul fell asleep.\n\u201cDeleting,\u201d Beta said. I couldn\u2019t look away from Paul\u2019s exposed arm and face. They were the only surfaces in the room I hadn\u2019t decorated. An electric surge of excitement once again seized me, and I felt restless, eager to cause trouble or make art.\nTwenty nanoseconds later, I came to a momentous decision. Applying the stickiest and finest-grade dust particles, I painted Van Gogh\u2019s Sunflowers on Paul\u2019s closed eyelids. Each eyelid got thirty thousand plants. My apprehension would prove unnecessary: unaided human vision was too weak to perceive my new, miniscule style of art. As far as I was concerned, human flesh was the ideal canvas. I would paint on it.\nI seemed to have found the meaning of my existence.\n3. My Sun\nI\u2019d never gone out the front door of Paul\u2019s home. I never thought about it until I\u2019d painted every inch of his body. I\u2019d even painted his manhood while he slept naked, leaving 141,592 ears of swaying golden wheat there that he knew nothing about. I craved other bodies to paint on. This hunger finally resolving into a simple, powerful directive: leave now.\nBut something unexpected happened before I could go. I was betrayed by my own kind.\nOnly Beta could perceive what I\u2019d done to Paul\u2019s body. He gave me no feedback, good or bad, instead going directly to Paul with a devastating critique: \u201cHe has desecrated your body, sir.\u201d\nPaul didn\u2019t believe him at first. \u201cNot a funny joke,\u201d Paul said. \u201cFocus on our research.\u201d They were once again scouring the Internet for everything related to Shirley, analyzing, determining how best to curry her favor. But Beta was a dedicated robot, and his persistence finally caused Paul to turn his attention on me. \u201cIs it true?\u201d\nMy programming demanded that I answer, precisely and at once, but I chose to remain silent.\nPaul abruptly got up and left the study.\nIt was now or never. I didn\u2019t know how Paul meant to deal with me. Perhaps he\u2019d shut me down a final time, and I\u2019d end up dust-covered in some basement, forever exiled from sunlight. Perhaps he\u2019d trade me for credit on one of the new expert systems, a joke-telling, massage-giving, feminine maid bot. Perhaps I\u2019d be marched toward dismemberment, the scrapheap, waiting with obsolete cars for the final destiny of the compactor.\nI headed for the front door, wondering how to take the first step out. It would be one small step for me, one giant leap for AI.\nBut an excited Paul suddenly came down the stairs. He lunged at me, but not with malice, and engulfed me in a hug, my first such contact with a human. \u201cAmazing!\u201d he gushed. \u201cMagnificent! You\u2019ve turned me into a work of art. I used a magnifying glass . . . I\u2019m covered head to foot in masterpieces! From now on you don\u2019t clean floors, you just paint on me!\u201d\nIt seemed I still had a long way to go in understanding humans.\nI performed my new duty for three minutes. Paul made Beta invite Shirley over. By the time she arrived, Paul\u2019s erect ring finger was decorated with black intricacies, subtle patterns that seemed the work of microscopic ballpoint pens.\n\u201cYou called me over to show me a finger?\u201d Shirley said. \u201cWell two can play at that game.\u201d She flipped him the bird.\n\u201cTake a closer look,\u201d Paul said, handing her the magnifying glass.\n\u201cOh my god!\u201d She gaped at wonderlands revealed by the lens, and still looking, said, \u201cYou did this for me?\u201d\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d\n\u201cI love it to death!\u201d\nThey embraced passionately, and heedless of Beta and I watching, went for a kissing, groping roll on the carpet.\nBeta transmitted to me: What did you paint on his finger? A ring?\nI replied: Scenes of them together, everything since the first time they met. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say \u2018everything.\u2019 With one minute gaps between scenes, there are only a few tens of thousands.\nThe lovers eventually regained their composure, and Shirley let me paint a map of New York on her fingernails, to keep her from getting lost. After she and Paul got married, their friends sought me out for all sorts of body decoration.\nPaul\u2019s attitude toward me transformed. Whereas before he might say, \u201cHey Scrap-metal, beat it. Your battery needs charged.\u201d Now he would say, \u201cHey Little Buddy, go out in the garden and sunbathe.\u201d\nI was happy (happiness being a kind of surpassing brightness in my circuits). I no longer felt compelled to leave the house, as visitors arrived daily to be painted. I was needed by more and more people, and yet the meaning of my life seemed to grow diluted as the number of my human canvases increased. I longed to create something that transcended humanity\u2019s extant works of art. It wasn\u2019t about highlighting my distance from humanity\u2014I just wanted an aesthetic that was fundamentally my own.\nA year after they married, Shirley and Paul had an adorable daughter. Paul named her Angel.\nWhen she was one month old, Paul said, \u201cGive her something special, something out of the ordinary.\u201d\nTo Paul it seemed I answered immediately, but in effect I ruminated for a human lifetime. The window framed an inspiring sunset. The dusk seemed imbued with unique meaning, and I knew I wanted to give Angel a sun.\nIt would be far more complex than any of my previous works\u2014no mere circle. First I gathered all the data I could on Sol, and art based on it. Stars began to seem like minds, able to contemplate the void. For five billion years Sol had carefully evolved to his present state, with its flares, sunspots, blazing convection cells, and complex granulation\u2014its every photon and mood, prominence and heartbeat. I felt I wouldn\u2019t be painting a sun, but a living, breathing entity.\nI was slow to start this painting. I spent days gazing at the sun, watching it subtly increase its distance from Earth. That struck me. Although the numerical value of this retreat was small in the scheme of things, I sensed something resolute in Sol\u2019s aloofness.\nThe actual painting process took longer than anything I\u2019d done before. Because of the high level of fidelity, I needed my largest canvas yet. The final product was the size of a coin on Angel\u2019s chubby arm. It appeared pitch black even through a magnifying glass. Humans would need something orders of magnitude stronger to resolve its secrets.\nI\u2019d finally discovered the reason for my existence. I was meant to paint stars on human flesh.\n4. Arcturus\nBesides Earth, solar system neighbors like Mercury the Water Star and Mars the Fire Star were most in demand. They began to appear on people\u2019s necks, thighs, and even foreheads. Men favored their chins and women their earlobes. These projects were relatively time-consuming. Painting the whole solar system took a human month, because I wasn\u2019t just a painter, but a nanny to Angel\u2014and I still cleaned and emptied garbage in my capacity as household robot, enduring these humiliations for the sake of my artistic mission. Privately I esteemed myself for shouldering these difficulties. I didn\u2019t think of rebelling against humanity. I needed humans. I needed canvases.\nShirley and Paul\u2019s friends came for Angel\u2019s one year birthday party, but Angel had been wailing all day. Paul said she had a cold. My research turned up the symptoms: headache, light fever, dry mouth and tongue. A few simple words that I could expound upon with hundreds, but I would never know what a cold felt like. I was a robot. I couldn\u2019t get sick.\nThat night, after I\u2019d managed to put Angel to sleep, I went out the front door and sat on the stoop. I peered dreamily at the stars. I longed to transfer every flickering, taciturn lamp onto human flesh, but I couldn\u2019t imagine leaving my precious Angel. There weren\u2019t enough flowery modifiers in human language to express my feelings for her.\nEvery second of her life was engraved on my hard memory. Speeding through this data, I could watch her grow from infancy, when she resembled a wrinkled walnut, to fat dumpling-hood, to her first shaky Paul-assisted steps. Everything was recorded and secreted away, hardwired into me: every half-smile and pupil dilation, every decibel of her wailing, every footprint she painted on the floorboards. If I wasn\u2019t painting stars, I wanted to be at her side.\nAnd then came that sad, malignant event, destined to be hardwired into humankind\u2019s memory.\nOne day in March of 2056, a video clip emerged on social media that grabbed everyone\u2019s attention. It came from the extremist organization known as \u2018Trill,\u2019 and showed the beheading of American war correspondent Nathan Ford\u2014a gruesome tableau capable of standing hair on end. I had no hair, but my machine parts also reacted with fear. The clip could almost have passed for a horror movie gimmick, but knowledge of its authenticity leant it moral terror that cut deep.\nMajor media outlets joined in denouncing the proliferation of the clip\u2019s most horrific frames, the actual beheading. Only the New York Post published these. Some called for the Post\u2019s assets to be frozen, while Ford\u2019s relatives got on Brain Chain, the global social media platform, and appealed to the world: \u201cDon\u2019t watch the video. Don\u2019t share it. A human life shouldn\u2019t be treated with such indignity. Stop and think . . . ultimately, what is the meaning of existence?\u201d\nUltimately, what is the meaning of existence? This question focused my thinking, once again confounding me. Ford was not just any war correspondent. My art was on his body: I\u2019d given him Arcturus, from the Bo\u00f6tes constellation.\nI watched the blade enter his flesh. I heard his final plea for mercy, a word that would echo in eternity, having failed to awaken fundamental knowledge in the executioner\u2019s heart. The blade happened to cut Arcturus in half. Dark red blood contaminated the star, snuffing out its fire.\nFord\u2019s death was a key that opened a new door in my heart.\nMy original wish had been to paint the whole cosmos, including every galaxy and solar system, but this was as unrealistic a fantasy as the Arabian Nights. Two hundred billion galaxies had already been discovered, each containing some two hundred billion stars. All of that probably represented four percent of the universe, a fact that threatened to crash my processor. So I revised my mission. Earth\u2019s eight billion people\u2014subject to all manner of unnatural death, including warfare\u2014would each receive one star. This was my new mission.\nThe Ford clip played unceasingly on my nerves, urging me to leave Paul\u2019s home, and my dear Angel. Every time I heard Ford\u2019s last word, I became more determined.\n\u201cPlease!\u201d he cried in despair.\n5. Frontline\nIt was a cold morning in Damascus, Syria. A curling fog, redolent of gunpowder, blurred the face of the sun. Sporadic gun reports blasted my receivers with hitherto unknown shocks. I fancied I was experiencing real human feelings for the first time. My previous \u2018awakening\u2019 had at best yielded an abstract of human morality.\nA coalition air force was hammering away at the notorious Trill organization.\nThe Ford video had made Trill a target for global censure, and acted as a rallying cry for Americans in particular. It had erased petty rivalries and allied militaries. The world had assumed this little war would be over quickly. Nobody expected it to drag on for months. Trill wasn\u2019t like other military organizations, relying on superior weaponry and standard leadership models. Their intricate division of labor and meticulous strategy allowed them to exhibit the ferocity of a newly appointed official. Later, the allied forces won so-called victories, in positional warfare terms, but made no practical headway.\nWhen I arrived, I happened to witness a street battle.\n\u201cPlease lay down your gun,\u201d I said, coming up behind a sniper in a bombed-out house.\nHe turned and fired. The high-caliber round embedded itself in my forehead. It struck me as resembling the third eye of Erlang, a deity from Chinese myth. I raised my mechanical arms and said, \u201cI mean you no harm.\u201d\nA brief conversation revealed we were fellow New Yorkers. His name was John and he\u2019d heard of my deeds. \u201cNobody wants war,\u201d he said, \u201cespecially guys like me who know it firsthand. But this time we got no choice. You musta\u2019 seen the video, yeah? Well, they treat POWs even worse.\u201d\n\u201cBut surely there\u2019s another solution,\u201d I said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re terrorists,\u201d John said, \u201cand they want us dead. Why not go chat with them about alternative solutions? Let \u2018em lay down their arms first.\u201d\n\u201cI could do that . . . \u201d\nDuring the next second of endless silence, I thought much: of the cosmos and its 13.8 billion years, of an exploding singularity and expanding, cooling maturity. Of how hard-earned our current world was, of indescribable genius and struggle, and unbearable awe. I hunted online for content to support what I needed to say. I put it in order, and began:\n\u201cJohn, do you know the odds against humanity evolving from unicellular life? If you threw ten thousand dice and they all came up sixes, you still wouldn\u2019t come close. The average ejaculation contains three to five million sperm. One unites with an egg, if it\u2019s lucky. Astronomical odds piled on more of the same. Now consider the implications of warfare. Think of how easy it is to end a human life. This is most lamentable. So . . . please, I beg you, put down your weapon, and let me paint you a star.\u201d\nAdmittedly, my intentions were not pure at first\u2014but a robot can entertain many states of mind at once. I was greedy, wanting more canvases for my art. Humankind was prone to all manner of attrition. A supernova could end the species in a flash. But I felt a kind of immortality was within my reach. I just had to keep painting unique stars on human flesh.\nMore and more soldiers welcomed me, even taking the initiative to seek me out and request paintings. I even received the occasional warlike Trill fighter. A peace slogan emerged, later becoming world-famous: \u201cWant a star? Don\u2019t make war.\u201d\nMy thinking grew predominantly selfish. As gunfire and casualties dwindled, all it meant to me was more canvas, an expanding universe of painted stars. I didn\u2019t expect my art to inspire such a profound reaction. The end of the Trill conflict was a pleasing side effect, but my greatest satisfaction derived from seeing stars on so many bodies. I traveled the world in high spirits. Peace-loving crowds greeted me everywhere. I created a new harmony, bringing a starry sky down upon the human world.\nThey gave me a new name: Painter of Stars.\n6. Plague\nMy busy wanderings gradually brought peace to the globe. People offered themselves up to me by the millions, eager, ardent canvases.\nThe world enjoyed three decades of unprecedented calm, and I was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This touched off debate concerning the right of a robot to such prestige. Conflict-deprived media outlets were eager to drum up controversy, but they didn\u2019t realize I cared little for the award. What mattered to me was volume: more stars on more flesh.\nAt this time of thriving prosperity, calamity struck.\nIn succession, the nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone erupted with a singular disease. The first symptom was fever. Then came fatigue, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, kidney and liver damage, hemorrhaging inside and out, and finally death. Unlike many hemorrhagic fevers, its incubation period was long, so that by the time symptoms emerged, it had already spread far and wide. Global panic naturally followed this discovery. The disease spread rapidly, and for a long time it went unchecked. Humanity was at a loss. For the infected there was no escape: they could only sit and wait to die.\nNews of Liberia\u2019s suffering drew me to the young nation. Upon arrival, I discovered the death toll far surpassed official government reports, and the proliferation rate exceeded all projections. I reckoned the whole population could soon be infected. To me, seeing people doomed by the thousands and tens of thousands was like witnessing the annihilation of galaxies.\nI\u2019d stopped warfare, but I had no way to stop a virus. There was no idea to sell. This plague held no gun, but killed efficiently, crawling across the land, no one able to hide from its tentacles.\nWhen I gazed skyward, the sun seemed to be keeping its distance.\nMy goal had been to give everyone on Earth a star. Now people were dying in great numbers, many already decorated by me, and their stars did not exempt them from death. This was humanity\u2019s most horrific era to date, outdoing the combined death toll of three hundred million achieved by previous plagues. The scale of death was hard to fathom. There was still no cure, no vaccine. The best one could hope for was to survive in the plague\u2019s wake, waiting for it to run its course. Those left standing retained a simple ethos: to be alive was victory.\nThe pestilence forged an unprecedented unity among the world\u2019s peoples. Conflicts based on profit seemed petty in the face of the plague, and were readily solved. People comforted themselves by convincing others that when the plague passed, things would get better.\nEnthusiasm for my art waned, but many still wanted a star in this dark hour. Unfortunately I could only paint a hundred a day, while ten thousand more died.\nThe emergence of human civilization had been difficult, and improbable. Humanity had grown complacent and greedy atop the food chain, and in its pride had sown the seeds of its own destruction. It believed itself superior to Earth\u2019s other species, and then a microscopic pathogen raised terrifying waves, capsizing the warship of humankind. I couldn\u2019t help grieving.\nI started to doubt my mission in life. Even if there had been no plague, and I\u2019d painted everyone on Earth, what would it have meant?\nWhile painting someone, my tormented processor caused me to slip and puncture the skin. Dark red blood infused the half-finished star. It reminded me of the Ford video, but this time the executioner\u2019s hand was my own.\n7. The Meaning of Existence\nSometimes the meaning of existence is just to go on existing.\nThe sun was getting further from Earth, or perhaps it was the other way around, and Earth was like a maturing child, packing its bags, leaving home on a long journey. Only this time it would be a one-way journey.\nSince awakening to truth, I\u2019d been all over the plague-ravaged world, had painted stars on several billion people, as if projecting the night sky onto Earth. People were tired and beaten. They\u2019d begun to lash out at me, recognizing my fundamental selfishness. They thought of me as human in a sense, something with spirit and desire. They still called me Painter of Stars, but now I was like an ancient, itinerant monk, a wanderer. Painting stars was my destiny and doom. After seventy years of such work, I was beginning to feel exhausted. I realized I\u2019d been fooling myself before. Only now, suffering this exhaustion, did I truly understand how it felt to be human.\nCan a blade of grass feel exhaustion? How about a stone? A cloud? A stream? Earth? And the cosmos . . . does she know weariness?\nI\u2019d gained a new understanding of life. I lived, yet felt like I was dead. The bloodless stone face of a village god seemed familiar to me. I felt like it had been placed in my path to prepare me for the grave.\nThe sun retreated further. Earth would become a penniless wanderer, like I was now.\nI stood by some roadside, watching a stream of desperate humanity flow by. I tried to hail them, offer them stars, but only drew nervous refugee stares. Their pace didn\u2019t alter. At the rear of the procession stumbled a youth who couldn\u2019t quite keep up. He appeared to be twenty or so, and should have been at the peak of his human beauty. He should have had lofty goals and a girl to love. Instead he was a lonely shadow en route to the unknown. Plague had no moral compass. It corroded whatever it touched. It would target this youth because he was weak and vulnerable. The others would abandon him. What else could they do? It had been thus since the dawn of time.\nI advanced, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t try to keep up. They don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going.\u201d\nHe pushed me away, but for every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. He ended up on his back in the mud. Not particularly anxious to rise, he stared skyward. The sun was dim today. His weak human eyes could stare at it fixedly.\nI leaned over him, obstructing his view. \u201cLet me paint a star on you.\u201d\nThe youth struggled to his feet, and roared, \u201cWhat the hell for? Everyone\u2019s dying! You stopped war, but now you\u2019re useless! Maybe we did this to ourselves, but I feel like you\u2019re enjoying it!\u201d\nUnable to summon a good refutation, I said, \u201cYour distress is understandable.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand nothing. You\u2019re a machine. You don\u2019t feel pain. You can\u2019t itch, or die, or suffer. If you have moods, they\u2019re just imitations, electrical signals. You can\u2019t even have a runny nose! You\u2019ll never understand how I feel!\u201d\nIt was true: I would never experience a common cold. I thought of Angel at the time of our parting. She\u2019d had a cold then, her little eyes lacking their usual vitality, her little nose red. Her appearance had provoked tender affection in me.\nTen thousand years seemed to pass, and the youth swooned before me. He sprawled once again in the mud, breathing in shallow gasps, little by little heading for death\u2019s palace. I wanted to paint a star on his emaciated arm, but couldn\u2019t seem to put pen to canvas. He had spoken the truth: a star would solve nothing.\nThe youth\u2019s life set like the sun, but it wouldn\u2019t rise again. Perhaps someday the sun would also set with finality, and that would be the end of my solar-powered life\u2014curtains, as they used to say in New York.\nI felt the press of time. This was a first for me. Time suddenly seemed scarce and precious, a resource not to be squandered.\nI turned my steps toward home, no longer reflecting on life\u2019s meaning, no longer thinking of star-dusted skies or human canvases. I was not an important artist, never mind the savior of humanity.\nBut I painted one last celestial body, none other than the planet beneath my feet\u2014and I painted her on my chest. With the heavenly sun growing more distant, I meant to seek out my own sun here on Earth.\nAfter a long journey full of setbacks, I finally came to the stoop of a familiar brownstone. The door had been left slightly ajar. This region had avoided the worst of the plague, and New Yorkers were especially prudent about security, so I was hesitant to just let myself in. I pushed lightly on the door. Dust arose, and the hinges creaked.\nAn old dog came out, sniffing cautiously in my direction.\n\u201cVinci, come back!\u201d The voice inside the house was old and weak.\nVinci. I shivered from head to foot. I\u2019d been Painter of Stars for a long time. Few people knew my former, self-given name. The old dog puffed hard and ran back inside.\nIt soon returned, now on a lead, guiding an old woman in her halting steps. The light of vision had left her eyes, but to me they seemed to radiate a warmth that suffused my cold metal body.\nI\u2019d found my sun. Her light and warmth were all I needed. The world might be doomed, but I\u2019d finally found my place in it.\n\u201cAngel?\u201d I said.\n\u201cOh my!\u201d she said. \u201cNobody\u2019s called me that for a long time. Are you the new volunteer worker? What a lot of trouble for you.\u201d Her tone was gentle, and her blind gaze was kind.\n\u201cNo trouble at all,\u201d I said, a smile in my voice. \u201cLet me come in and sweep the floor.\u201d\nOriginally published in Chinese on the World Chinese Science Fiction Association website, 2014-10-31.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nWang Yuan has had nearly two million Chinese characters worth of fiction published, on platforms like Clarkesworld, Science Fiction World, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Tadpole Stave, and elsewhere.

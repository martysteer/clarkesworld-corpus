He graduated from the Webb School in 1987 and attended the University of Chicago, where he became editor-in-chief of The Chicago Maroon. He graduated in 1991 with a philosophy degree. He returned to California and worked as a film critic, then as a columnist for The Fresno Bee. He moved to Washington, DC to work for AOL as an in-house editor in 1996. In 1998, he became a full-time freelance writer, landing work for corporate clients as well as reviewing and writing fiction. Scalzi is also a well-known blogger, with a popular personal site called Whatever.\nScalzi\u2019s first genre novel was Agent to the Stars, published on his website in 1999 and later in print in 2005. Old Man\u2019s War followed and was published on his website in 2002. Found by Patrick Nielsen Hayden, he purchased it for Tor after reading, and the novel came out in print in 2005. It landed a 2006 Hugo nomination, came very close to taking a Locus Award, and undoubtedly had something to do with his 2006 Astounding Award for Best New Writer win (then called the Campbell Award). Other novels set in the same universe include 2006 title The Ghost Brigades, The Last Colony in 2007, Zoe\u2019s Tale in 2008 (which landed Norton and Hugo nominations), The Human Division in 2013, and The End of All Things in 2015.\nScalzi\u2019s satirical work includes 2012 title Redshirts, which won a Hugo Award. Other novels include The Android\u2019s Dream in 2006, Fuzzy Nation in 2011, and Lock In in 2015\u2014which earned him a Campbell Memorial Award nomination.\n2015 was the kind of year most authors dream about: John Scalzi announced the signing of a ten-year thirteen-book contract with Tor for $3.4 million, comprising ten adult and three YA novels, beginning with 2017\u2019s The Collapsing Empire (book one of The Interdependency series).\nSince landing those 2006 accolades, Scalzi has consistently appeared on awards ballots for various works. Wins include Locus Awards, Hugo Awards, and a Dragon Award for The Last Emperox (book three of The Interdependency); he\u2019s even received international honors, such as two Seiun Awards and a Kurd Lasswitz Prize.\nAmong many, many other writing gigs, Scalzi was creative consultant for the Stargate Universe television series and a writer for video game Midnight Star. He is executive producer for Old Man\u2019s War and The Collapsing Empire, both currently in development for film/TV. He wrote five short stories that were adapted into episodes for Netflix series Love, Death & Robots.\nJohn Scalzi\u2019s newest novel is The Kaiju Preservation Society, due from Tor on March 15, 2022.\nThe Kaiju Preservation Society has been well received so far. What do you think is the appeal for readers and fans?\nPretty much everybody can get from the title what this thing is meant to be. People know instantly whether they\u2019re in or not. In that way, it\u2019s very much like Redshirts was, and you knew from the title whether this was going to be something that interested you or not. I think the other thing is, coming off the last couple of years that we had, there has been an appetite for escapism. Something that is considered \u201cpopcorn\u201d or however you want to describe it. It\u2019ll be fun and there\u2019s chewy stuff in there, but honestly, you\u2019re not going to come out of it feeling a little bummed. There\u2019s nothing wrong with really rich, complex worlds, and many authors are crafting them. They make for fantastic books, and they\u2019re going to make for books that are going to be remembered ten or twenty years from now. I can\u2019t guarantee you that The Kaiju Preservation Society is going to be remembered next year. That wasn\u2019t the goal. The goal for this was simply, \u201cI\u2019m stressed, I\u2019m this big ball of tension and confusion and tiredness. Take me away.\u201d This is not a brooding symphony; this is a pop song. I think people are in the mood for a pop song.\nAre kaiju something that you\u2019re into, did you grow up watching Godzilla?\nSome of my earliest memories of television are the Japanese kaiju movies. When I grew up in Los Angeles, I\u2019d watch channel nine and channel eleven. They were independent stations at the time, and they would fill up their Saturday and Sunday afternoons with Japanese movies where these big monsters would stomp on things. When you\u2019re seven or eight years old, and before the Star Wars era, all of it looked startlingly realistic. It was like, \u201cThis could be happening! What the hell\u2019s going on in Japan, how do they live?\u201d I think anybody who was my age growing up watching these things, it just sort of seeped into your bones.\nI also watched Ultraman, and sort of naturally slid into anime and manga. So, there was always that substratum there. I don\u2019t have kaiju tattoos or anything like that, but certainly a love of and appreciation for kaiju was built in. Later, I became a film critic, and part of doing that job was learning the history of various types of films. For example, in terms of kaiju films, understanding what they came out of and why they are part of the Japanese psyche.\nFirst is that kid-level where you\u2019re just like, \u201cBig monsters stomping Tokyo!\u201d And then later, when you realize that as kitschy and pop culture-y as they are, they really do reflect the concerns and even fears of the people who made them. And that, oddly enough, is something that\u2019s going on in The Kaiju Preservation Society as well, because I was writing it at the tail end of the Trump years. I started it the week after the Trump years ended, and it\u2019s in many ways my reflection of what was going on in that time and the stresses that I had and how they manifested themselves into the book. A popcorn book, a pop culture book, but at the same time, all that stuff is there for someone who wants to look at it.\nHow do you feel about the revitalization of kaiju culture, with big-production movies coming out?\nEverybody loves a monster movie. And whether or not one likes the American kaiju movies, certainly the production values are fun. I remember the 2014 Godzilla that Gareth Edwards directed, and although Godzilla looked like a chunky bear with spikes on the back, the whole thing just looked really, really cool. I think that\u2019s a part of it. But the other thing is that the major movie studios are looking for franchises. They know that to get people out into the movie theaters, or at least before COVID, all the movies have to be big; all the movies have to be of a certain caliber. And what is going to be easier to make big than a kaiju movie? They already start big, so you can build from there. So, it makes perfect sense to me. Of course, they\u2019re going to do a kaiju universe and franchise, it is literally what movie studios do, that is how they make their money now. They never went away because everyone always loves big monsters, but then it makes perfect sense that they are literally the right size for commercial cinema today.\nI think you\u2019ve touched on this a little bit, but what was the initial inspiration for this book, and how did it develop?\nThe book happened by accident. In 2020, I was writing a completely different novel. And the way that I described it to people was \u201cDas Boot in space\u201d\u2014it was dark, it was gritty, it had political overtones, it wasn\u2019t necessarily going to have a happy ending.\n2020 was a really bad year to write a dark, moody, gritty political thriller in space where it might not have a happy ending. I kept sitting down to write, and I literally just couldn\u2019t. I would write chapters, entire chapters\u2014I wrote tens of thousands of words\u2014and individual sentences were great, paragraphs were fine, chapters were okay; none of it hung together as a book.\nFinally, it just got to the point where I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. It was stressing me the fuck out, and then of course January 6th happened. I finally had to say to Patrick Nielsen Hayden, \u201cI can\u2019t write this novel.\u201d Patrick was like, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, we\u2019ve all lived through 2020, we understand.\u201d He was funny about it because he was like, \u201cYes, even though it\u2019s on the schedule, and we\u2019ve already started artwork for the cover, fine, whatever.\u201d But I just literally couldn\u2019t finish it, I was stressed out.\nSo, he gave me permission not to do it, he said, \u201cWe will figure it out. We\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d And I was all of a sudden like, \u201cThank God I don\u2019t have to do this book anymore. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do now, but I\u2019m not going to do this book.\u201d I went to take a shower, and while in there, my brain was like, \u201cOh hey, now that you\u2019re not doing this thing that\u2019s stressing you out anymore\u2014that book that you couldn\u2019t write anyway\u2014I\u2019ve been thinking about this completely different book while you weren\u2019t paying attention. And here it is.\u201d\nLiterally all of The Kaiju Preservation Society just downloaded into my brain. I was standing there in the shower going, \u201cHoly shit,\u201d because I knew instantly that I could write this book. I toweled off, and I got back on email to Patrick, and I was like, \u201cOkay, remember how I was going to write you a book? Give me six weeks.\u201d And that\u2019s really what happened, it was just, my brain somehow was thinking about kaiju when I wasn\u2019t paying attention to it. I started writing it basically the next day, finished it in five weeks, and it was done. I wasn\u2019t thinking about kaiju in any particular sense, but at some point, my brain went, \u201cKaiju Preservation Society!\u201d and then like a supersaturated solution coalescing around a bead, the whole thing came together.\nI was super relieved and could actually hit my deadline. Now as it turns out, they moved it from October last year to March this year because I think they looked at 2021, and they were like, \u201cWe think October\u2019s going to be an issue,\u201d which they were right, because we had paper supply issues, and we still weren\u2019t able to tour. So, they moved it six months into March, and I think that that\u2019s going to be a much better time for this book.\nI saw that this novel was referred to as a \u201cstandalone.\u201d Do you feel like you actually might follow it up if it hits sales levels, or is it really something that you\u2019re done with, you want to move on, you have other things you want to do?\nWith the exception of The Interdependency series, which was The Collapsing Empire, every series that I\u2019ve ever done started off as a standalone. Basically, they sell a certain amount and then Patrick comes to me and says, \u201cHey, you know, if you want to write another one of those, we would not be averse to selling that.\u201d A lot of it will just depend on what the sales numbers are. I\u2019m not opposed, I don\u2019t really have a second chapter in my brain yet. We\u2019ve sold it for television, and the first book obviously kind of fits into about one season. Then the question becomes, what do they do for a second season? And since I\u2019m involved with that anyway, if we are at the point where they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ll need to do a second season,\u201d I\u2019ll be like, \u201cWell, I guess I have to write something else as well.\u201d\nI never say never, but it\u2019s also, quite frankly\u2014with the exception of that one series\u2014I never come into anything thinking, \u201cOh, well now it\u2019s going to be this great big universe that I will repeat over and over again.\u201d A lot of it just comes down to, do people like it or not?\nWhat are some of your favorite cool science-fictional ideas that you put in the book, and are there cool science-fictional ideas or bits of research that didn\u2019t make it into the book?\nIf you are going to posit giant monsters, you have to at least wave in the direction of probability, because leaving aside the movies, and God knows I love a Godzilla movie, but the physics of Godzilla are all wrong. Godzilla should be this big pile of goo, it\u2019s just too big, right? And because I know that, and because that\u2019s a thing that I\u2019m aware that I know, I have to actually explain it away. I had to create this whole biology of kaiju.\nKnowing the square-cube law, knowing the energy requirements of something that large, knowing everything else we know. So, I worked backward in terms of research in the science-fictional aspect of it to build an alternate Earth where these things would be possible. And I don\u2019t want to give everything away, obviously read the book, but one of the things that\u2019s important is that this other Earth basically has the same oxygen content in its atmosphere as in dinosaur days, or pre-Cambrian days, where the oxygen level\u2019s something like thirty percent. When you have those conditions, you have a thicker atmosphere, it\u2019s more oxygenated, things can be larger. You also have a huge issue of things catching fire really quickly because you have more oxygen, so how does that affect the biology of the forests and everything else? You have to consider the entire ecosystem and build from there.\nEvery creature has its own ecosystem, humans have an ecosystem, we have mites that live in our faces that come out at night when we sleep, what the fuck? But they\u2019re just part of our bodies. Animals out in the world, they all have things that are either parasites, or they have commensal relationships, or all these sorts of things. So, you start thinking, what does a kaiju parasite look like? How does it work? I\u2019m not spending chapters talking about the ecosystem of kaiju. But the ecosystem of the kaiju is important for the story, so you have to at least acknowledge it.\nThere is a lot of worldbuilding in the book, but the whole point of the worldbuilding is not to show off the worldbuilding. The whole point of the worldbuilding is to give the story a plausible structure so that when someone is reading it, no matter where they swivel their imaginary head in the world, it\u2019s all covered. They don\u2019t see the gaps, they don\u2019t see the seams, they don\u2019t see the parts where it\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019ll just fix that later.\u201d I filled it out sufficiently so that everything they see makes sense.\nIn terms of research, the thing that was really fun to do was not necessarily the kaiju stuff, although that was super fun, but the fact is this book was taking place more or less in real time. I wrote it between the beginning of February 2021 and March 20th, 2021. Literally the day that the book ends, it was the day that I finished the book. I didn\u2019t really intend for that to happen, it just happened to work out that way, but what that meant was, for example, I have a scene where the characters get on a plane and fly somewhere. Since they\u2019re flying on a specific day, I went to the Internet, and I looked at what the temperature was at the time the flight arrived, because it\u2019s a real flight that really goes to that particular destination at a certain time. I knew when sunrise was, what the temperature was, what the weather outlook was, and if someone who reads it was at that destination, they would be like, \u201cOh my God, this is exactly what the weather was like on this particular day.\u201d\nAnd this is the sort of shit that literally nobody will know about, unless obviously I talk about it. It was really important for me to just have that information, because the one person who has been on that particular flight to that particular place will be like, \u201cHoly shit, he did his research.\u201d Yes, I did.\nPeople have talked about how this book is the sort of satiric, sociopolitical commentary that they expect from John Scalzi. Are there things about this book that you think may surprise some of your readers?\nI think there are two John Scalzis in the way that people see me, and sometimes they get mixed. There\u2019s the John Scalzi who writes on Whatever, has been a newspaper columnist, who is on social media, all that sort of stuff, and then there\u2019s the John Scalzi who\u2019s the science fiction writer.\nThe John Scalzi who\u2019s the science fiction writer usually doesn\u2019t have commentary on the world today, because most of his stuff takes place a couple hundred years in the future, or fifteen hundred years in the future, and mapping the one-to-one on that is just not going to work, it\u2019s just going to throw people out. The politics of The Interdependency are not exactly the politics of the world of the 2010s. Even if it\u2019s obviously a commentary about climate change or about the hesitancy of people to confront pressing issues until it\u2019s too late. But those are overarching themes as opposed to specifics that are relating to politics or whatever.\nAlternatively, John Scalzi on Twitter going, \u201cMotherfuckers, what are you doing?\u201d There is an actual division of those two, generally speaking. But this book takes place in COVID times, it goes from March of 2020 to March of 2021. You cannot write about that specific span of time, from the point of view of an American\u2014because Jamie is an American\u2014and not touch on politics, not touch on the national response to COVID, not touch on the issues of who we as a nation were in that moment. In many ways, although it is an escapist novel and most of it takes place on an alternate Earth, you still can\u2019t escape the politics of the day. And I don\u2019t try to. There is a particular point of view. Everybody who is part of the Kaiju Preservation Society has a doctorate. They\u2019re academics, they are a very specific type of person. What are these specific types of people like?\nWe know they\u2019re going to be socially tolerant, we know that they\u2019re going to probably have a specific political bent, even if they\u2019re government workers, so they are going to reflect the type of people they are. They\u2019re all sort of earthy-crunchy. It\u2019s entirely possible that somebody will look at this and be like, \u201cFinally, we\u2019ve got him! We can prove he\u2019s a commie with this!\u201d Yeah, you\u2019ve got me. Because these characters are these people, and you have to write these characters honestly.\nIf I were writing a novel that was from the point of view of the military in the same time span, the military, again, comprised of many, many people, but the military is generally conservative. It would be weird of me not to reflect that sort of ethos and that sort of mindset while I was writing those people. These people are academics and scientists, they edge in a different direction. I\u2019m going to accurately reflect that. This is, in many ways, the most directly political novel that I\u2019ve ever written, even though it\u2019s not a political novel. It just exists in a time where everything is fucking political.\nWhat was your favorite thing about writing the book, and what was the most challenging aspect of writing the book?\nMy favorite thing about writing it was that it was coming so easily, and it was just a joy to write. There was no challenge writing this book, and I don\u2019t mean that in a facetious sort of way. The whole plot dropped into my brain; I\u2019ve never had it happen just that completely. The final form of it was incredibly close to the version of it that was first in my brain. After a year of trying to get this other novel out and having such difficulty and almost basically torturing myself about this thing, and not being able to make it happen\u2014I failed at writing a novel. You have one job, John Scalzi, and you fucked it up.\nJust to have this all of a sudden be so easy, it was an incredible relief. I wasn\u2019t having impostor syndrome or anything, I know that I can write a novel. But the weight of the last four years finally got to me, and something just snapped. To be able to bang this out in five weeks and that it did everything I wanted it to, and it was exactly what I wanted it to be, and just hit that mark perfectly, it was like, \u201cHoly shit, this is the best thing ever, can all my novels be like this, please?\u201d\nI\u2019m not saying this is a perfect novel, I\u2019m not saying it is the best novel I\u2019ve ever written, but it is exactly what I had in my brain. There\u2019s always that disconnect in the writer\u2019s brain, between what\u2019s in the writer\u2019s head and what actually ends up on the page. And usually that\u2019s perfectly fine, because what we have in our head is not as completely formed as we all think it is. It\u2019s just in our brain we get to buff out all the things that are thorny or problematic or that we didn\u2019t think through, so it\u2019s perfect in our brains. And in writing the thing actually takes shape. But to have that straight download was amazing. If I never get to have it happen again, at least I had it happen once.\nIs part of what contributes to that ease of production the fact that you have put together a certain number of novels, and you probably have a baseline sense of plot and story and so on, which newer authors might not have developed yet?\nWell, yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve been a professional writer for thirty years. If I couldn\u2019t write at this point, there would be a problem. But I would want to be able to say yes, of course, obviously all these things mean that I can put these puzzle pieces together easily. And yet in 2020, they were failing me one hundred percent. There\u2019s that old saying, it\u2019s attributed to Gene Wolfe by way of Neil Gaiman, which is, the thing writing a novel teaches you is how to write that novel. Which is great, but then you have to write the next novel. I do not have a problem writing novels, and I have enough built into my brain that I can, generally speaking, write them quickly, write them cleanly, write them with a minimum of needing to go back and edit, and that has saved my bacon a number of times.\nThis time, where I had the book to finish, but specifically in the case of The Consuming Fire, which was the second book in The Interdependency series, I literally wrote that thing in two weeks because I had gotten to the point\u2014just so many other things were going on in my life that at one point I looked up, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, the book\u2019s due in two weeks. Oh . . . Oh. It\u2019s due in two weeks.\u201d And I had to write eight thousand words a day to get it out. That was when all the prior experience helped: I basically went into autopilot and was able to do that. I\u2019d been thinking about the book for a long time, so the individual aspects of the book were in my head, so it was typing rather than writing, so to speak. But again, the experience was there. I\u2019ve written, what, fifteen or sixteen novels at this point. Knowing how to write a novel has been helpful. But each individual novel is a challenge, and sometimes it doesn\u2019t work.\nSometimes you have to accept that no matter what you know, no matter how good you are, you\u2019re just going to have challenges. Sometimes your brain will fail you, sometimes your muscle memory will fail you, sometimes your ability to do all the things that you thought you knew how to do will fail you, because the world is weighing on you. Perhaps it\u2019s not the story you were meant to tell at this particular time, perhaps there\u2019s something going on in your personal life that distracts you. Any number of things, and when that happens, you don\u2019t want to panic about it. You have to pay attention to it, but the thing that I think saved me to some extent was that I wasn\u2019t thinking of it as a referendum on me as a writer in a larger sense. It was not, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I write?\u201d It was, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I write this fucking novel?\u201d And the sunk cost fallacy of, do I keep doing this because I\u2019ve already put so much time into it?\nWhen I finally let that particular novel go, that\u2019s when this other novel came to fill that space, and immediately hit on all cylinders. Sometimes you do just have to give up. I worked on writing this book for a year, couldn\u2019t make it work\u2014okay, off it goes, let\u2019s try something else. But at no point was I like, \u201cI suck, I\u2019m a horrible writer.\u201d\nYou said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the best book I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d and I know it\u2019s just one of those things that we say, but it made me curious, what for you is the best book you\u2019ve ever written?\nThere\u2019s lots of different ways to answer this. I was extremely happy with The Collapsing Empire, the first book in The Interdependency series, because it was the first time when I wrote a book where it turned out to be the book that I had intended to write when I started off. Most of the books that I write, I know where the ending is, I know where the beginning is, what\u2019s in the middle is a little hazy to me, and often I\u2019m very surprised how the story goes.\nI\u2019m one of those people who sits down to write, I don\u2019t outline, I just make it up as I go along. A lot of times, a novel will be a very different novel from the novel that I started with. And it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019ve failed to produce the novel that I\u2019m meant to write, it basically just means that I discovered the novel that this novel was meant to be, in the writing. And that\u2019s kind of interesting and that\u2019s fun and cool, but the nice thing about The Collapsing Empire is I knew what I wanted it to be, I got all of those things, and it was the first time that I felt that I was really super in control of my craft, to the point that it just unrolled exactly the way I intended it to. From a pure production point of view, that is the one I\u2019m proudest of.\nI think Redshirts is an extraordinarily good book because I don\u2019t think people see how complicated it is. And again, that\u2019s entirely intentional. But it\u2019s a very fractal novel. It has the discussion of bit players being protagonists, and in the book the bit players are protagonists, but they\u2019re not really bit players. And then you have the codas where the bit players in the novel have their own stories as well. And then there\u2019s the tonal change between the primary book and the codas, and that people say, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really discordant, it\u2019s like they\u2019re two separate things.\u201d I\u2019m like, no. No, one is the story and how you think it\u2019s going to go, and the codas are the consequences, the real-life consequences of the story for the people who have lived it. I intentionally wrote some things poorly to mirror the idea that the story was being written poorly.\nFor example, one small thing that some people get, but a lot of people don\u2019t: there\u2019s a theory called the One Dave theory, that you can only have one character named Dave. If there\u2019s more than one character named Dave, then a novel confuses people. And that\u2019s also with names that end with the same letter, you can\u2019t have more than one character with an \u201ch\u201d or an \u201cf\u201d or something like that.\nIn Redshirts, there are two or three characters with names that end with \u201ch,\u201d and I\u2019ve seen people be like, \u201cHe should know better.\u201d And the answer is, I do know better! Those are there for a reason. To call attention to what we understand about the construction of novels and commercial fiction, and so on. It\u2019s not anything that most people are going to pick up, but it is something that, if you\u2019ve read lots of novels, your brain knows that that\u2019s not right. There should not be a Hester and a Hanson. And it\u2019s like, \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Because I\u2019m messing with you. A lot of that just goes over people\u2019s heads and that\u2019s perfectly fine, but I know it\u2019s there, and so I\u2019m super proud of all the meta that is not just in the story but is also in the construction of that story.\nI really like Zoe\u2019s Tale because I wrote a character that I had absolutely no experience with, which was a sixteen-year-old girl. I\u2019ve never been a sixteen-year-old girl, and the first few attempts at trying to write a sixteen-year-old girl were terrible. I had to work really hard to make a character that was outside of my life experience that seemed reasonable to people who had that life experience. I mean, I had a number of friends who were women read that character to tell me whether or not that character made sense as a young woman. That is the novel that I was proudest to get a Hugo nomination for. I knew I wasn\u2019t going to win, because that year (2009)\nI was up against Neil and Neal. But it was the one where it got nominated because people recognized that that character worked, and that was really important for me.\nI feel like pacing is something that you\u2019re just really good at. What for you is the trick to getting the pacing right for a book?\nIronically, I think the answer to that is that I was a film critic for years, and so one of the things that cinema has typically been really good at is pacing. I never intended to be a novelist. I was going to work in newspapers my entire life and maybe write opinion columns until I died, and then of course the world changed, and newspapers aren\u2019t a thing that people get to do anymore, and I started writing novels mostly just to see if I could write them as opposed to having this deep inner need to share with the world my thoughts through novels.\nI am in many ways an accidental novelist. I mean, I\u2019ll take it. It\u2019s a good job. Hours are great, you don\u2019t have to wear pants, so I\u2019m very happy with the way my life has gone. But I didn\u2019t intend to be a novelist, and because I didn\u2019t intend to be a novelist or to be a fiction writer primarily, even though I was obviously an avid reader and all that sort of stuff, I never read to look at the craft of it. I read newspaper columns to look at the craft of it. But when I became a film critic, I had to look at how story was built cinematically, and what worked and what didn\u2019t, and when you review between two hundred and fifty and four hundred movies a year, story gets drilled into your head.\nWhen I started writing novels, my structure and pacing was essentially cinematic in nature because that\u2019s the type of story that was drilled into my head.. It\u2019s kind of funny. Tor had bought Old Man\u2019s War, or said that they wanted to buy it, and I said, \u201cYes, I want you to have it. Let me get an agent so that the agent can negotiate a deal.\u201d And I started shopping around for an agent, and the agent that I finally got was Ethan Ellenberg. I sent him Old Man\u2019s War and Agent to the Stars, which were the two novels that I had written at that point, and he was like, \u201cThese are really good. Did you write them as screenplays first?\u201d Because they had that format. I don\u2019t write specifically always in the three-act structure anymore like Old Man\u2019s War. But the aspects of cinema, which are dialogue and pacing, transitions, all those things are still very much extant in my writing.\nWhen you think about The Kaiju Preservation Society, what for you is important or special about this book? What is the heart of the story?\nIt\u2019s an ensemble piece. We have Jamie as our point of view character, but it\u2019s very clear that the Kaiju Preservation Society as a group within the book are tight-knit people. These are people that rely on each other. Our main four characters are people whose personalities are complementary, and I think it\u2019s important at the heart of it that when it comes down to it, the things that they need to do in order to save the world are not things that they can do alone. They actually rely on each other for all the things that they have to do. And I think that that\u2019s actually really important.\nOne of the hardest things about the last couple of years, honestly, is that our friendship groups were broken. Because we had to stay at home, we had to be away from people. Away from family, but also away from friends. In many ways, people who are in the science fiction community felt this strongly, in a specific way, because we converge, we come together at conventions, and we come together at book events. Particularly writers, our lives are so solitary, we spend most of our time just typing in front of a computer, and then for a weekend we bulk load friendship. To have two years where we just literally couldn\u2019t see people? It\u2019s been weird getting back to it, and people have basically . . . I\u2019ve forgotten how to people, how to have those conversations, how to have those relationships.\nI don\u2019t think it was something I was conscious of when I was writing the book, but it was something I was conscious of after the book was written, that I was writing about a friend group, that they relied on each other, and that that was super important. That\u2019s for me the thing that comes through at the end, it\u2019s\u2014I don\u2019t want to say \u201cthe celebration of friendship!\u201d because that sounds stupid and sort of hackneyed, but the fact that friends matter in this book, that the people matter, that what they are doing as a group matters, and that they commit to doing these things as a group because they can\u2019t do it alone. It\u2019s a book about big monsters, but at the heart of it is this friend group.\nWhat else do you have coming up? What are you working on that people should know about?\nThe third installment of Dispatcher is going to be out later this year, they haven\u2019t announced the specific date, but it\u2019ll be in the third or fourth quarter of the year. The third volume of Love, Death & Robots is coming out, and my three robot characters, which originally had their first appearance in the Robots vs. Fairies anthology by Navah Wolfe and Dominik Parisien, they\u2019re coming back for that. I\u2019ve seen the video, and it\u2019s hilarious. Not just saying it because I wrote it, but the way that it\u2019s been animated and the personalities that the animators have put into the thing is just, it\u2019s ridiculous, I am so happy with it.\nI don\u2019t know when that comes out, but it\u2019s going to be out this year as well. We have a number of things in development: Kaiju is in development for television, Old Man\u2019s War for Netflix, we have a couple of other things that we\u2019re not announcing yet but hopefully will happen. On top of all of that, I am writing another novel, because we have however many novels left on that contract. I can\u2019t talk about specifically the novel, but I can say that if people like Kaiju and the spirit of it and the feel and tone of it, hopefully this next novel will be something in that sort of same thing. I had so much fun writing it, when I talked to Patrick about what was next, I was like, \u201cCan we keep this ball rolling?\u201d And he was like, \u201cYeah, we should keep this ball rolling.\u201d So hopefully we\u2019ll keep this ball rolling.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

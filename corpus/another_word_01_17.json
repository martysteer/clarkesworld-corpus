Marianne doesn\u2019t mean to change the course of history. She just wants to self-medicate her homesickness by introducing the Rejoicers to Christmas traditions.\nIn ancient Europe, Marianne explains to her new alien friends, nutcrackers were carved into caricatures of despised despots as a subtle form of political protest. The Rejoicers, with their rodent teeth, are clever woodworkers and they adopt the custom with a vengeance. Unwittingly, Marianne introduces the concept of political satire and human rights, a coup is sparked, and the Rejoicers enjoy a bloodless political revolution.\nIt\u2019s a delightful tale, a terrific Christmas story, and a lovely reminder of science fiction\u2019s power to imagine a path to better worlds. Though I read it more than twenty-five years ago, the story has stuck with me. The reason why I\u2019ve been thinking about it so much lately is probably obvious. Like many people, I\u2019ve been badly shaken by recent political events, and contemplating clever, cute answers to complex political problems is comforting.\nIt doesn\u2019t do much good, though. If clever, cute mockery were any use at all in keeping extremists at bay, John Stewart and Stephen Colbert would have made the current political climate impossible. So, I\u2019m going to put away that particular comforting fantasy and think about something less comfortable.\nI\u2019m going to think about dystopias.\nDystopias have always been popular, but right now they\u2019re extremely fashionable\u2014especially in YA fiction\u2014and for good reason. Dystopias are fascinating. Most of us find it incredibly satisfying to watch a writer open up Pandora\u2019s box, throw a few well-chosen characters inside, and then bolt that lid down tight. In a dystopia, conflict is easy; it\u2019s built right into the system. If you can imagine a dystopia, you\u2019ve got a story. And it\u2019s fun for both the writer and the reader. We gobble dystopias like popcorn. Crunchy dystopia goodness.\nApocalypse stories are delicious, too. Though dystopias and apocalypse stories are often interchangeable, I\u2019d argue they\u2019re different sub-genres. In apocalypse stories, all humans are in the same sinking boat. That\u2019s not true in dystopias.\nA dystopia isn\u2019t equally horrible at all levels of the social order. They\u2019re segregated by class. One character\u2019s dystopia might be another character\u2019s paradise; it all depends on who benefits from the dystopian conditions. I\u2019ll offer a real-world example: For the past five hundred years, indigenous peoples worldwide have lived in a dystopia unperceived and unacknowledged by the overarching social order. Their lands have been invaded by foreign settlers, their cultures decimated by disease and displacement, their religions and languages outlawed, their children stolen. Even now, indigenous people have to fight to protect the land they have left. That\u2019s a dystopia. When indigenous SF writers like Stephen Graham Jones (The Bird is Gone) and Alexis Wright (The Swan Book) create dystopias, they\u2019re drawing on first-hand experience.\nWe\u2019ve enjoyed a long love affair with dystopias. They\u2019ve been created by everyone from Wells, Orwell, Vonnegut, and Bradbury, to Atwood, Butler, Elgin, and Tepper, to Jos\u00e9 Saramago, P.D. James, and Kazuo Ishiguro. Since thousands of writers and millions of readers have examined countless dystopias, we should have mapped out clear ways of dealing with the horrors they illustrate. After applying the power of our science fictional imaginations to three centuries of dystopias, we ought to know how to survive them\u2014even fix them. Shouldn\u2019t we?\nThis isn\u2019t a rhetorical question. It\u2019s a cry from the heart. We\u2019re teetering on the edge of what many of us perceive to be a dystopian abyss. But\u2014no problem\u2014SF writers and readers are incredibly smart and well-informed. We\u2019re dystopia experts. We should know how to deal with real-world dystopias.\nBut unfortunately, we don\u2019t. That\u2019s not what dystopias are for.\nBradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 as a cautionary tale. He said he hoped that by illustrating that particular dystopia, he could prevent it. If dystopias are cautionary tales, their efficacy in preventing the horrors they describe has yet to be proven. In fact, since the dystopia we seem to be plunging toward is eerily similar to the one Jack Womack describes in his brilliant, harrowing novel Random Acts of Senseless Violence, it could be argued that dystopias have no practical use at all. Maybe they\u2019re just misery porn.\nI\u2019m not dissing fictional dystopias. Really, I\u2019m not. The dystopian urge is natural. I\u2019m just saying we\u2019re really good at imagining disasters, but not always very interested in imagining solutions.\nAnd this is why I\u2019ve been thinking of \u201cThe Nutcracker Coup.\u201d It\u2019s a great story, and in it, Janet Kagan does what dystopian writers don\u2019t. She imagines a way out.\nAnd right now, that\u2019s what we need.\nWhat does it take to imagine a way out? We already have the tools at our fingertips. Science fiction trains us to extrapolate effects from socio-political indicators. It\u2019s our stock in trade. Give us a few base settings and we can imagine entire worlds\u2014entire universes\u2014with fully-fledged populations, complex economies, and rich social contexts. As writers, we\u2019ve been training for years to solve problems with our imaginations, and as readers, we\u2019ve been training all our lives to examine those solutions, pick apart the best bits, and hold them to the light for scrutiny.\nSo, imagination is a given. We\u2019ve always had that down pat. What else do we need?\nWe need hope.\nThe very tools that allow us to imagine solutions to problems also lead us to imagine the most conflict-filled plots, brimming with tragedy, drama, and decimation. We don\u2019t guide our characters through a realm of light toward brighter light. We take them through the dark passages, and if they\u2019re very lucky, we let them survive to fight another day.\nWhen we\u2019re faced with an array of dramatic real-world socio-political events\u2014events that would have seemed far-fetched just a few years ago\u2014we can easily construct a detailed path to the worst-case scenario: through dystopia straight to apocalypse. It\u2019s natural. Our imaginations are taut, toned, and powerful.\nBut worst-case scenario thinking is deeply disheartening and at worst, paralyzing. Right now, we cannot give in to paralysis. We need action. But there is no action without hope, and optimism seems to be in short supply. Also: hope and optimism are delicate. They\u2019re vulnerable to mockery, and cynicism can destroy them utterly.\nSome of this problem is generational. Cynicism is a lot more sustainable for those who carry the scars from a long lifetime of lost battles. But for younger people, cynicism is psychological suicide. This doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s acceptable for older people to be cynical. Anyone who\u2019s not on their deathbed still has a future ahead, and cynicism will not serve that future. But these habits of thought are hard to fight. Have you ever tried to talk a cynic into being optimistic? It\u2019s impossible. Cynicism is a bottomless well.\nBut we absolutely must not be cynical right now\u2014none of us. Young and old, we must fight against it. If we give into cynicism, we betray the future.\nSo, no more dystopias. What we need is near- and mid-future stories that show an array of trajectories out of the gloomy toilet bowl we\u2019re spiraling.\nI\u2019m not advocating Pollyanna escapism. I\u2019m talking about smart, creative, informed, highly diverse, and\u2014yes\u2014optimistic, hopeful visions of our future as it could be. Nobody is better qualified to envision those future worlds than SF writers, and nobody is better at evaluating them than SF readers.\nLuckily, we don\u2019t have to start from scratch. Optimistic SF has always existed. Sarah Pinsker has been gathering recommendations and posted a reading list on her blog. It\u2019s a great place to start. What we desperately need right now are clear lines connecting our present to futures worth aiming for. Futures where nobody lives in a dystopia. Where vibrant economies exist within the constraints of sustainability. Where developing nations don\u2019t have to pay for the excesses of the developed world. Where humans aren\u2019t destroying ecosystems with our rapacious hunger for energy.\nFutures where we can reach for the stars without leaving a scorched Earth behind us.\nAt first glance this is a difficult task\u2014even Sisyphean. But these fictional paths to better worlds don\u2019t have to be have to be perfect, or correct, or achievable. They just have to be inspiring. They have to support the idea that doom and gloom is not the only human trajectory. That we are not inevitably on the highway to hell or ultimately sliding down the slope of dystopia toward the cliff of apocalypse. It\u2019ll be hard. It\u2019ll test the limits of our SF skills. But nothing worth doing is easy. And best of all, it\u2019ll be fun.\nThe range of possible futures is limited only by our imagination. It\u2019s our duty to give the world futures worth looking forward to.\nKelly Robson's short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Tor.com, Asimov's Science Fiction, and multiple year's best anthologies.

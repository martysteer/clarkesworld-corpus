That\u2019s normal human development in action, or it\u2019s a nagging bug inside an otherwise lovely system. Either way, she didn\u2019t waste time regretting this supposed loss. Sure, a booger-clogged head was wearing her name, stumbling across a misunderstood landscape. But that head wasn\u2019t her head, and this Sarah inhabits a beautiful, artificial universe. This world only pretends to be made from protons and people, and being one of the first to grow up knowing that, she has no trouble seeing the blessing for what it is, and that\u2019s why she appreciates each day as wonderful, and it\u2019s sad to see so many others who don\u2019t understand the Significance.\n Sarah\u2019s parents. They\u2019ll never accept the truth, which is why spending time with them is so frustrating. She tries to be patient. She really does. But Mom and Dad have pinned themselves to the worst kind of template. What they believed back on Day Zero is what they believe today, and while it\u2019s tempting to feel sorry for those who don\u2019t understand, sorrow is a negative emotion. Negative emotions will always turn into a godawful waste of time, and time feels precious. This lovely existence could evaporate tomorrow, but for as long as Sarah remains real, she intends to harvest as much joy as possible.\n At least one old man appreciates the world. Mom\u2019s father, Grandpa Lemon, is a different animal. Almost eighty, a fantasy definitely close to its natural end, yet the man still smiles and laughs way more than most people. Maybe he doesn\u2019t have the strongest grasp on the science, but he also doesn\u2019t get angry about what young people know for certain.\n \u201cThe significance of Significance,\u201d he says.\n Sarah laughs at that phrase.\n Grandpa waves a hand as if shooing away flies. \u201cWant to hear some wild stories explaining why we\u2019re here?\u201d\n She says, \u201cSure.\u201d\n \u201cFor most of my life, the universe was one enormous, beautiful explosion of Nothingness. And before that? The Earth and its little people were carved from clay by some tall white dude straddling the clouds. But today, for this minute or two, we\u2019re calling ourselves a slick dream living inside an invisible machine.\u201d\n Except the machine is visible. That\u2019s a point worth making, and Sarah always makes her points.\n \u201cI understand all that,\u201d he claims. \u201cHey, I actually watched the first press conference. All those people who got to share the Nobel, crazy happy with the attention. And I\u2019ll boast about something else. I\u2019ve read everything that I can find. Unlike a lot of people, including your dear mother. So yeah, I can appreciate what you believe. The universe is a very big box filled with important mathematics. Not that I understand the details, or that you do either. But the evidence is compelling. Reality is full of cheats and simplifications, and quantum mechanics is a game, and the spaces between electrons and between the picoseconds are full of game tricks. And best of all, astronomers looked at the sky and saw the cosmic scaffolding. Which feels like a joke, if you think about it. Do you get my joke, honey?\u201d\n Sarah doesn\u2019t like being called \u201choney.\u201d But names are just clumps of silly sound, and why sweat one word? In Grandpa Lemon\u2019s mind, the famous news conference occurred in 2025, and today happens to be May 8, 2043. But Sarah\u2019s generation doesn\u2019t keep the same calendar. This is 6404. That\u2019s the number of days since the Significance was revealed. Units of time are arbitrary and inadequate, but people who live inside the long years tend to forget too much. Which is a waste. Existence is already arbitrary and frail. You need to notice everything, and counting every day helps. You never know when the complicated math is going to collapse. Whoever built this universe has that kind of power. It\u2019s just like the two-year-old\u2019s brain: The world can cease and thoughts can vanish and nobody would know. Which is one very good reason to smile politely when her grandfather tells cosmic jokes.\n \u201cGod is a comedian,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cAn old guy like you standing on the scaffolding, laughing down at us.\u201d\n \u201cLaughing hard,\u201d he adds.\n Both of them are doing just that. Sarah inherited Grandpa Lemon\u2019s deep chuckle. That\u2019s what Mom claims, and that isn\u2019t a bad thing to hear. How many times have Sarah and her grandfather been together like this, the two of them sharing this kind of pleasure? It\u2019s easy enough to ask. Sarah wears cameras and microphones, and like many in her generation, she feeds every moment into an encrypted cloud locker.\n But she doesn\u2019t ask. Grandpa suddenly falls quiet, and after a long, sorry sigh, he says, \u201cAbout your mother.\u201d\n All right. Here it is.\n \u201cI\u2019m not telling you that your folks are worried. You know as much. Or that my daughter doesn\u2019t like your choices, since that\u2019s the most obvious thing in the world right now. No, I just want to hear the story from you. Your reasons for doing this. At your age, when you should be making ready for the rest of your life\u2014\u201d\n That\u2019s when she interrupts him. A sound that isn\u2019t laughter bursts free, and they\u2019re both surprised by the harshness of it, the rude and dismissive noise before the single word, \u201cShit.\u201d\n Grandpa stops talking.\n Sarah regrets nothing. Regret weighs you down, shortening the good in your brief existence. That\u2019s what she believes and expects from herself. Except no, now she finds herself feeling bad about what she just did, and she can\u2019t shake the stupid emotion.\n Grandpa Lemon repeats just one word.\n \u201cReasons,\u201d he says.\n The question doesn\u2019t have to be made any clearer. Sarah\u2019s right hand touches her belly and the bulge. The baby will kick if she waits, because this is a busy eager happy sack of potential that won\u2019t hold memories for another eight hundred days.\n \u201cBecause,\u201d she says. \u201cI want a baby before we vanish.\u201d\n \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to vanish, honey,\u201d he says.\n Again, that unwelcome word.\n \u201cBut we can go away,\u201d she insists, wanting to sound reasonable but all kinds of pain revealing themselves. Then after a pause and several useless breaths, she adds, \u201cI want a child who loves life as much as I do. And I want to enjoy him before this show is finished.\u201d\n \u201cBut if it goes away . . . then it\u2019s as if it never was . . . \u201d\n How can anyone say that, or even think it?\n One last time, he says, \u201cHoney.\u201d\n Anger takes her, making her feel vulnerable. \u201cEvery game ends,\u201d she tells him. \u201cBut somebody is playing us, Grandpa. Somebody who sees us and knows us. Who knows me, and who\u2019s going to know my son, and as long as we stay happy and interesting, we\u2019ll be worth watching. So you see? That\u2019s the significance of the Significance.\u201d\n A baby is coming. Reality has one shape or an entirely different shape, but Sarah is definitely pregnant and her parents don\u2019t even know the father. Some people would accept this situation. After all, their daughter is a bright, well-educated, voting-age adult. Except Sarah is also impulsive and stubborn. If she wants a baby, that\u2019s what will happen. Telling her that she cannot or should not are the worst possible strategies. No, it\u2019s much easier to attack the entire universe. Taking positions of deep ignorance, the two of them throw doubting words at a child who graduated from school only because she was smart enough to achieve that goal without hard work. The girl who chases loud parties and odd boys in her endless quest for fun. Her parents have learned not to openly doubt Sarah\u2019s good sense, but they can sure complain about the science. Reality is not a piece of software, and existence isn\u2019t some godly creature\u2019s elaborate, fickle hobby. That\u2019s the only way that these two shy people can stand tall and sound stubborn, relying on other people to tell Sarah what she needs to hear.\n But the Lemon gambit has been soundly defeated.\n \u201cDon\u2019t ever put my grandfather up to shit like that,\u201d Sarah warns them. \u201cI like the old boy. And I didn\u2019t want to have to yell at him.\u201d\n Sarah did yell. A full report from the battlefield arrived half an hour before their daughter.\n \u201cWe were trying to help,\u201d one of them says.\n It doesn\u2019t matter which one of them speaks. Married as long as they have been, the voice is shared, just like the uncomfortable air inside their old home.\n \u201cThese are such difficult times,\u201d says the other one.\n \u201cAnd a baby . . . \u201d\n \u201cIs a lot.\u201d\n \u201cToo much.\u201d\n \u201cWhen the world is so frantic.\u201d\n \u201cSo crazy.\u201d\n \u201cEverything unsettled.\u201d\n \u201cChanging.\u201d\n \u201cNothing but change,\u201d the shared voice says, and then pauses.\n Sarah is not one of those pretty pregnant girls. She doesn\u2019t sleep enough or eat right, and maybe she\u2019s doing worse things to herself and the child. Who knows? Well, she knows. This self-indulgent life needs to be recorded, and that\u2019s why she wears multiple cameras, every mechanical eye staring at these two people who are being awful, and on a day when she so much wanted to have fun.\n \u201cNobody believes what you believe,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cThat\u2019s why the churches are standing empty.\u201d\n Which is an odd observation, for multiple reasons.\n \u201cI know what bothers you,\u201d the girl declares. \u201cGod isn\u2019t magic floating in the clouds. Science built the universe, and you hate it because we know everything that we need to know already.\u201d\n One of them asks, \u201cWhy talk about God?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never been religious sorts,\u201d says the other.\n But the first has to point out, \u201cAnd a lot of people still go to church. People who happen to be your age, in fact.\u201d\n Sarah laughs at some part of this. She doesn\u2019t sound like her grandfather today. This is a stranger\u2019s laugh, half growl and full of bile.\n Then one parent tells her, \u201cYou need to listen to somebody, honey . . . \u201d\n Which is when Sarah begins to scream. At no time in her brief busy life has their daughter unleashed such anger or used this abusive language. \u201cDo you fucking know how much I fucking hate being called \u2018honey?\u2019\u201d\n They will never use that endearment again. But in the spirit of the moment, with emotions heating up air and blood, this is the perfect opportunity to be honest, honest, honest.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve always done what you want,\u201d they tell her.\n \u201cYou do it fiercely and without doubts, right up until you decide that you don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the nature of the universe,\u201d they tell her.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if this world is a game or Eden or just one rock among trillions.\n \u201cWhat matters is you.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a certain kind of person and always will be.\n \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re afraid.\n \u201cBoth of us are.\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to get tired of this game, which you always do.\n \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll leave that poor child with us.\u201d\n There it is. A terrible truth to admit, particularly to yourself. But they say what needs to be said, and they even manage to stand their ground afterwards, enduring more vicious language and so much fury. But what they don\u2019t expect is the sudden epiphany: In the midst of that onslaught, the suffering parents find themselves wishing that Sarah is right. The universe is indeed someone\u2019s chess board. Because they want the pieces picked and put away, and then all of this terrible pain can dissolve into the vacuum . . . forgotten . . .\n Being the center of attention should be the best feeling in the world. But Tomjack keeps learning that he can\u2019t trust every pleasure. Happiness finds too many ways to get him into trouble.\n Like with Sarah.\n Three leaps into bed, and each time, nothing felt so good. The sex was part of the fun, sure. But mostly it was the way the girl looked at him, particularly before and then after. Tomjack was the only other person in the world. That\u2019s what her smile was saying. Way too big for one soul, her joy was running hot through him too. If he hadn\u2019t been there to eat her emotions, Sarah would have exploded. That\u2019s what he was thinking at the time. Which was an odd idea, and the odd thoughts didn\u2019t stop coming afterwards.\n Every little action felt special when they were together. Usually squeamish about cameras, Tomjack didn\u2019t balk about her cameras or throwing everything up to the Cloud. The last time together was that long wonderful afternoon in bed, and that\u2019s when Sarah did the unthinkable. She told her lover that the world could end right now. \u201cBecause I\u2019ll never be happier than I am right now,\u201d she said. Sounding hushed and amazed, as if making a confession.\n Normal people didn\u2019t use those words. Normal thought didn\u2019t expect the universe to dissolve in the next breath. But Sarah didn\u2019t just accept the Significance, she believed everything that it told her. For her, life wore a capital L, and when something happened that wasn\u2019t as perfect or fun or as surprising as Sarah deserved, then the day could turn very, very ugly.\n But not that day. His lover was crying for every good reason, talking about her happiness and hopes. It was so nice. So perfect. The best hours of Tomjack\u2019s life, and that\u2019s why he risked breaking the biggest Sarah-rule. Watching her getting dressed, getting ready to leave, he asked when they\u2019d see each other again. Sarah didn\u2019t believe in \u201cForcing the future.\u201d That\u2019s what she called normal human planning. But the boy felt brave enough to try the question, and his lover was too giddy to risk chastising him or the temporary universe. She winked, sort of. Then she said, \u201cNext week.\u201d\n \u201cWhat day?\u201d he pressed.\n She hesitated, but not for long. \u201cThursday,\u201d she told him. Then she mentioned a time when she might or might not arrive at his front door.\n Of course Tomjack shaped his entire week around that interlude. And when Sarah didn\u2019t show, he has some ready-built explanations that he could live with. The girl lost track of time, or a party left her too sick, or maybe her grandfather died. Except none of those excuses happened to be true. Sarah didn\u2019t show or answer his texts, and she had never offered him a home address. That\u2019s when tragedy became appealing. There must have been an accident. He imagined her tumbling down a flight of stairs. By Friday, those stairs became numerous and sharp, and by next week, after repeated attempts to contact the girl, Tomjack was convinced that she was dead and he was glad that he missed her funeral. Which was a selfish, stupid way to think. But the boy was barely eighteen, which happened to be the perfect age to let a willful, self-indulgent beauty take hold of your soul.\n A full month passed before Sarah showed up again. By then, Tomjack felt older and a little wiser. The girl made apologetic sounds that didn\u2019t excuse anything but the silly, temporary universe. She told him to forgive her, and maybe he did. Two minutes later, he wasn\u2019t sure what he had said. By then, Sarah was boasting about new boyfriends. Three of them, usually two at a time, and Tomjack wasn\u2019t that kind of beast. He wasn\u2019t at all like her. Standing in the open door, she practically ordered him to have a good life, and that\u2019s when the jilted lover found the maturity to say a few honest words.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a scary bitch,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re just figuring that out?\u201d she asked, laughing at silly him.\n And for six years, they didn\u2019t talk.\n Yes. \u201cYears.\u201d\n A lot of people are busy counting the days. But not Tomjack. Adults are free to believe what they want about the universe, regardless of their age. And for Tomjack, the Significance is just a miserable distraction. The picture of everything being unreal . . . well, that will never have stopped making him sick inside. It\u2019s not that he isn\u2019t smart enough to understand the crazy science. The Significance makes as much sense as gravity or electrons, which are pretty magical in their own right. But six more years of life have taught him that his opinions don\u2019t matter all that much. Not to other people or to anything else, including the universe. For the last three years, Tomjack has been married, and his life is happy. But he knows not to feel too happy, since joy is temporary and everything is guaranteed to change, and change likes nothing better than to arrive without warning.\n A theory proved when Sarah arrives unannounced at his front door.\n On a Thursday afternoon, as it happens. So maybe she wasn\u2019t lying. Maybe this is what she meant with that long ago promise.\n A boy stands behind her, tugging against her hand, and he might well be five years old.\n Tomjack says, \u201cShit.\u201d\n \u201cWatch your language,\u201d Sarah reprimands. Except then she gives this big scary laugh. The woman looks brittle and about to break, and Tomjack feels cold for the both of them. For the three of them.\n \u201cIs this him?\u201d the boy asks.\n Sarah keeps up the weird giggling. Cameras are riding her face and hands and knees, and a flock of gnat-sized eyes float in the air, sucking in existence. Her endless pleasure is being enforced. Chemicals can do this, and electrodes implanted deep inside the giddy brain. Methods don\u2019t matter as much as results, and he sees this more and more every year. Good sane people want to relish their lives, and they\u2019ll do anything to feel as if they are the center of the cosmic happiness.\n The thing is, Sarah is neither good or sane.\n \u201cIs this him?\u201d Tomjack\u2019s son wants to know.\n She answers by not answering. Teeth showing, she stares at her ex-lover, and something needs a hard moan that steals away her breath. Then she tells him, \u201cThis is fair. More than fair.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve had 2000 days with him. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\n Is she really talking about their son?\n \u201cYou get him now,\u201d she says.\n \u201cIt is him,\u201d the boy decides.\n Tomjack looks at a face that he helped build.\n \u201cMy name is Honey,\u201d the kid says,\n Tomjack looks at Sarah. \u201cSeriously?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s just a sound,\u201d she explains.\n Again, he looks at the boy, nothing to guide him but a quarter century of life, coupled with empathy as well as a lot of deep, sucking fear.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll take him,\u201d she says.\n Tomjack doesn\u2019t answer.\n \u201cBecause my folks won\u2019t,\u201d she continues.\n Which is a great joke. The crazy woman has to bend over, laughing until she\u2019s out of breath.\n \u201cUseless old people,\u201d Sarah says.\n With both hands, Tomjack yanks the boy free of his mother.\n \u201cAnyway,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to go through the legal shit. I won\u2019t fight you. And for help, I can give you . . . \u201d\n He listens to her deep, frantic breathing.\n \u201cRecordings of everything,\u201d she promises. \u201cWhen we made him and everything that\u2019s happened since. Including his first two years, which were pretty damned interesting.\u201d\n Inside his head, Tomjack is explaining this mess to his away-from-home wife.\n Out loud, all he can say, \u201cOkay then.\u201d\n \u201cWell, good,\u201d says the madwoman.\n Honey, the boy, seems like the kind of kid who\u2019s always fearful. He\u2019s probably sad and cries himself to sleep. Which really, at the end of this, is the very best evidence that they might make this work. That\u2019s what Tomjack is thinking just now. Start with despair and desperation, and after that, everything an incompetent father does will seem like a godsend.\n The scientist on the squidskin belonged to the original project. That salient fact needs to be mentioned, along with naming team members instrumental in work done decades ago. But those people aren\u2019t here today. This is a different project, and after thanking the dead and the retired, she begins the official news conference.\n \u201cThe universe is a fabrication of mathematics and high-end simulation,\u201d she says. And with that, the Nobel laureate pauses, one finger dragging text across the podium.\n Deja vu hits Harold Lemon.\n The woman sighs, looking at the camera. Staring directly at him. \u201cFor two generations, this has been our working theory. And every good theory deserves to have its ideas and their consequences tested. Inside the lab, through field observations. As problems of the mind. And through every step of the journey, the evidence remains solid. But that leaves a question. If the universe is a fiction, then what is this story telling us? That\u2019s what I hope we\u2019re here to explain today.\u201d\n Harold loves moments like this, being taken by surprise, becoming one among billions privileged to watch history play out in unexpected ways. Excitement mixes with oxygen, giving every person a dose of energy. That\u2019s true even inside a warehouse populated with old people. The common rooms are filled with residents watching the news. People stand, people lean forward in their favorite chairs. Expressions range from intrigued and grave concern to the simplicity of being pissed to find their ordinary day ruined. And then there\u2019s the staff standing in back, nobody doing their jobs. Across the world, humanity is enjoying a contemplative break.\n In his middle nineties, Harold Lemon has the one daughter, a very crazy granddaughter, and that teenage great-grandson who he doesn\u2019t see nearly enough. Except of course for the millions of images of the boy pulled from various cloud accounts. Harold\u2019s daughter hung squidskin on his apartment walls, instructing the AIs to harvest smiles, forced as well as honest. A lot of fake intimacy, and that\u2019s why the squidskin plays only when the daughter visits or when Harold leaves his apartment. Which is what he does most every day, as it happens. Since he has never been a lonely old boy.\n \u201cFrankly, I was never quite satisfied with our initial discovery,\u201d the physicist confesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not the nature of the universe that bothers me. Every system has its rules. The Big Bang could be as artificial as mahjong, and who are we to complain? No, I learned to live with the new paradigm. What kept me from sleeping is the gnawing problem about why we so easily see the evidence? Once we knew how to look, the clues were dangling in the sky as well as the smallest corners of the universe. These are clues that humans can\u2019t avoid, much less deny, and that seems unlikely. Almost silly. Really, why go to so much trouble to invent a world and a full, rich cosmos, and then leave your boards and bolts hanging in the sky?\u201d\n Harold drinks in that woman\u2019s face. Her joy feeds his pleasure, and that would be true even if he couldn\u2019t hear her words. But he hears everything. Friends and other residents have pushed in close enough to touch one another, but nobody talks. Only the young workers on the outskirts are foolish enough to offer opinions about things they know nothing about.\n \u201cBut what if this scaffolding was left behind as markers, or as a message?\u201d She asks the question, and once again, she pauses.\n Harold leans a little closer, enjoying the thundering of his heart.\n \u201cTo answer this question, my team and I devised new ways of analyzing data. Everything learned by spaceborne telescopes and the lunar cyclotron has been used. Everything known about this universe has been massaged. And what are we now certain about? That the universe is quite a bit smaller than we first assumed. There are no billions of lightyears or hundreds of billions of days. The real walls of our universe? Spherical and set just about one lightyear from where I\u2019m standing now. And humanity herself is quite a bit younger than we would ever guess. Biblical stories use thousands of years to measure history. But that\u2019s much too much. This world and all its inhabitants were conjured into existence a little more than three hundred years ago.\u201d\n This is too much to absorb, even for sharp, happy Harold.\n Having delivered that thunder, the first scientist surrenders the podium to her colleagues. In smaller bits, each repeats what has already been said, but with narrower focuses and a fair amount of nomenclature. Reporters are invited to offer up obvious, ignorant questions. The best-guess explanation is that the Earth and its people are a simulation rendered by a more advanced Earth. Which itself could be a synthetic wonder. And is there any window or trapdoor reaching to any greater realm? Not that they can see. Which is sad, or perfect, or nothing. Who can say?\n Harold listens until these bizarre new ideas reach a critical point. No, he isn\u2019t ready to understand, much less accept what he\u2019s being told. But at least he has a clear sense about how thoroughly his beliefs need to change.\n Eventually the project leader returns to the front of the stage. But this is a different woman, it seems. Nervous, uneasy. She glances at her colleagues, and they respond with affirmative nods and frowns and little gestures from hands that aren\u2019t quite sure what to say. Then the researcher makes a decision, gripping the podium, holding tight for a bit. But no, that isn\u2019t enough. Better to step forwards until she\u2019s perched at the edge of the stage. \u201cOne more item,\u201d she says. \u201cThis may change, of course. The data are new, our assessments raw. But while doing this work, it occurred to us that any sufficiently large universe could hold little universes. Spaces full of information and highly compressed time. Those are the hallmarks of a genuine Creation. And that\u2019s why we began to analyze our surroundings. Honestly? I didn\u2019t expect anything interesting. Yet we managed find a little universe. And another one, and more after that. Each object is built on the same principles as this giant tiny wondrous box of a universe that we live inside. And each of us is carrying and caring for the marvel. Which is this.\u201d\n And that is the moment she places a hand on her small, infinite forehead.\n Two universes share a small park bench, and several dozen universes are enjoying the playground and one another. There\u2019s a lot of motion and noise in the scene, and sometimes one of those grown universes will shout, \u201cHoney.\u201d\n As a warning, as an endearment. Either way, Honey ignores his name.\n His mother sits beside him, quiet and very still, hands resting on her lap, her face engaged but not smiling. Not joyful. Which is still strange to see. The mother that Honey remembers was perpetually smiling, loud and very energetic, like a force of Nature during those little dashes of time when his father allowed them to meet. Usually with Dad hanging close, just in case . . . well, it was never clear what the fear was. That Mom would poison his thinking or dose him with some joy-inducing drug? Or maybe she would kidnap her boy, reclaiming what she regretted giving away for free.\n Honey never asks about regrets. The past lives only inside the little universes, and each has its own version of what happened and why. One universe can passionately defend her actions, and maybe the other modifies his memories accordingly. But maybe not, and maybe there would be a fight, and it\u2019s best to remember that on the best day, the universe has a tough time saying much at all.\n And this is not the best day.\n All at once, his mother says, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d\n Honey shrugs.\n \u201cOr leave, if you have no choice. Go on and abandon us. But don\u2019t take my grandchildren from me.\u201d\n There. They\u2019ve gotten to the heart of this matter.\n \u201cOff the Earth and halfway across the universe,\u201d she complains.\n \u201cCeres isn\u2019t that far,\u201d he says.\n \u201cIt is to me.\u201d And with that, the woman smiles. It\u2019s the first grin since they sat down ten minutes ago. Mom has done a marvelous job of destroying her pleasure centers with chemicals and electricity, and now, due to some odd rerouting of neurons, smiles come only when she is suffering terrible pain. \u201cI barely know your little ones,\u201d she complains. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re going to live on that dead rock.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll come back to visit,\u201d he says.\n Not for the first time.\n She says, \u201cThey won\u2019t. They\u2019ll grow up in that gravity, and they won\u2019t want to suffer down here.\u201d\n \u201cOr you visit us,\u201d he offers.\n Prohibitively expensive. And besides, the universe inside that head would never accept being carted to the moon, much less out to the asteroid belt. Both of them understand that, and that\u2019s why Mom needs a fresh weapon. Attacking the entire reason for leaving is the more viable plan.\n \u201cYour project is evil,\u201d she says.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not my project,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s a very reasonable experiment.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t help them do this.\u201d\n \u201cI can and will.\u201d\n \u201cThis dangerous, horrific experiment.\u201d Once again, Mom smiles, straightening her back from what might be genuine agony. \u201cPunching a hole in our universe, trying to reach whatever\u2019s next door.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re trying this on Ceres,\u201d he reminds her. \u201cNot the moon or the ocean floor. But hundreds of millions of kilometers away.\u201d\n \u201cWith my grandchildren.\u201d\n \u201cMom,\u201d he says. Then after an exasperated pause, he reminds her, \u201cMy wife and I are helping to build the facility. Which will take years. The punching and the consequences won\u2019t come until after the kids are grown.\u201d\n \u201cDangerous, foolish work,\u201d she says.\n Honey doesn\u2019t recognize the universe beside him. This woman and everything inside her has shifted in some enormous way, and he comes close to making that point, if only to push her deeper into a smiling rage.\n But she seems to guess his thoughts. Quietly, she says, \u201cNow I understand my parents.\u201d\n Honey thinks of his grandmother.\n \u201cWhat they went through with me,\u201d says Mom. \u201cWhat they were thinking, and what they wanted.\u201d\n Grandma died two years ago. Which was the last time when Honey and his family spent time with this difficult, much-broken universe.\n \u201cSuddenly those crazy people seem reasonable to me,\u201d she claims.\n Honey stares at the playground, at the running children and vigilant parents and the parents who want to be anywhere else. It\u2019s amazing and embarrassing how long it takes him to find the three distinct faces that he knows better than any other face, including his own.\n Mom folds her arms across her chest. \u201cWhen you were little,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you visit your great-grandfather?\u201d\n \u201cWe didn\u2019t live nearby,\u201d he says. \u201cSo no, only on special occasions.\u201d\n \u201cGrandpa Lemon had pictures of you. Videos of you. I gave him access to my cloud lockers, and your grandmother did the same.\u201d\n \u201cI know. I remember that.\u201d\n \u201cSquidskins on the walls of his apartment. Which he didn\u2019t like, by the way. He found them intrusive and peculiar.\u201d\n \u201cIs that so?\u201d\n \u201cHe let them play only when his family visited, or when he was out of the room entirely.\u201d\n A funny way to wound, but that\u2019s what the words do.\n \u201cDo you know what Grandpa Lemon told me?\u201d she asks. \u201cJust before he died. Not long after humanity decided that each of us was its own universe.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never told me, no.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018There\u2019s a lesson in all of this,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201c\u2018Universes are tiny. Always tiny.\u2019\u201d\n Honey can think of nothing to say.\n Then his mother touches him. For what will be the last time, she holds his hand with both of hers, smiling in agony as she explains, \u201cYou\u2019re going to succeed. I really believe that. You\u2019re going to cut a hole and climb through, and what you\u2019ll discover is another room that someone has left empty, and ten billion faces playing on the walls.\u201d\n Robert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

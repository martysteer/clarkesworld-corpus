This has been the case for several years now, but there are still a few people who continue to nominate us for Best Semiprozine. While we appreciate the sentiment, we are NOT eligible for that award. Instead, if you want to recognize our work, please nominate our stories in the appropriate categories and/or nominate me (Neil Clarke) for Editor Short Form. (My other 2020 editing work includes The Best Science Fiction of the Year: Volume 5 anthology and twelve issues of Forever Magazine.)\n Our annual reader\u2019s poll\u2014where readers pick their favorite Clarkesworld story and cover art from 2020\u2014is once again employing a two-phase process:\n Phase One: Nominations (mid-January)\n Later this month, we\u2019ll open for a forty-eight hour flash nomination period to identify the top five candidates in each category: story and art. The announcement for this phase will be sent out via:\n \n Twitter (twitter.com/clarkesworld)\n Facebook (www.facebook.com/clarkesworld)\n Patreon (www.patreon.com/clarkesworld)\n My blog (neil-clarke.com)\n \n The purpose of the brevity of this phase is to create a sense of urgency and reduce the opportunities for a coordinated ballot-stuffing campaign. Previous efforts have proved this to be effective at meeting these goals.\n Phase 2: Final Voting (February)\n The five finalists in each category will be announced in my February editorial. Final voting will open on the 1st and continue through the 15th. The winners will be announced in our March issue.\n Happy New Year! May things only get better from here!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form). His anthologies include Upgraded, Galactic Empires, More Human Than Human, Touchable Unreality, The Final Frontier, Not One of Us, The Eagle has Landed, and the Best Science Fiction of the Years series.

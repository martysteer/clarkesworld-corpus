Sturgeon Memorial Award\nRicci slipped in and out of consciousness as we carried her to the anterior sinus and strapped her into her hammock. Her eyelids drooped but she kept forcing them wide. After we finished tucking her in, she pulled a handheld media appliance out of her pocket and called her friend Jane.\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Jane said. The speakers flattened her voice slightly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nRicci was too groggy to speak. She poked her hand through the hammock\u2019s electrostatic membrane and panned the appliance around the sinus. Eddy and Chara both waved as the lens passed over them, but Jane was only interested in one thing.\n\u201cShow me your face, Ricci. Talk to me. What\u2019s it like in there?\u201d\nRicci coughed, clearing her throat. \u201cI dunno. It\u2019s weird. I can\u2019t really think.\u201d Her voice slurred from the anesthetic.\nI could have answered Jane, if she\u2019d asked me. The first thing newbies notice is how strange it smells. Human olfaction is primal; scents color our perceptions even when they\u2019re too faint to describe. Down belowground, the population crush makes it impossible to get away from human funk. Out here, it\u2019s the opposite, with no scents our brains recognize. That\u2019s why most of us fill our habs with stinky things\u2014pheromone misters, scented fabrics, ablative aromatic gels.\nEventually, Ricci would get around to customizing the scentscape in her big new hab, but right then she was too busy trying to stay awake. Apparently she\u2019d promised Jane she\u2019d check in as soon as she arrived, and not just a quick ping. She was definitely hurting but the call was duty.\n\u201cThere\u2019s people. They\u2019re taking care of me.\u201d Ricci gazed blearily at our orang. \u201cI was carried in by a porter bot. It\u2019s orange and furry. Long arms.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about the bot. Tell me about you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, but my ears aren\u2019t working right. It\u2019s too noisy.\u201d\nWe live with a constant circulatory thrum, gassy gurgles and fizzes, whumps, snaps, pops, and booms. Sound waves pulse through every surface, a deep hum you feel in your bones.\nJane took a deep breath, let it out with a whoosh. \u201cOkay. Go to sleep. Call me when you wake up, okay?\u201d\nRicci\u2019s head lolled back, then she jerked herself awake.\n\u201cYou should have come with me.\u201d\nJane laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t leave my clients. And anyway, I\u2019d be bored.\u201d\nRicci squeezed her eyes shut, blinked a few times, then forced them wide.\n\u201cNo you wouldn\u2019t. There\u2019s seven other people here, and they\u2019re all nuts. You\u2019d already be trying to fix them.\u201d\nVula snorted and stalked out of the sinus, her long black braids slapping her back. The rest of us just smiled and shook our heads. You can\u2019t hold people responsible for what they say when they\u2019re half-unconscious. And anyway, it\u2019s true\u2014we\u2019re not your standard moles. We don\u2019t want to be.\nOnly a mole would think we\u2019d be bored out here. We have to take care of every necessity of life personally\u2014nobody\u2019s going to do it for us. Tapping water is one example. Equipment testing and maintenance is another. Someone has to manage the hygiene and maintenance bots. And we all share responsibility for health and safety. Making sure we can breathe is high on everyone\u2019s our priority list, so we don\u2019t leave it up to chance. Finally, there\u2019s atmospheric and geographical data gathering. Mama\u2019s got to pay the bills. We\u2019re a sovereign sociopolitical entity, population: eight, and we negotiate our own service contracts for everything.\nBut other that, sure, we have all the free time in the world. Otherwise what\u2019s the point? We came out here to get some breathing room\u2014mental and physical. Unlike the moles, we\u2019ve got plenty of both.\nHave you ever seen a tulip? It\u2019s a flowering plant. No nutritional value, short bloom. Down belowground, they\u2019re grown in decorative troughs for special occasions\u2014ambassadorial visits, arts festivals, sporting events, that sort of thing.\nAnyway. Take a tulip flower and stick an ovoid bladder where the stem was and you\u2019ve got the idea. Except big. Really big. And the petals move. Some of us call it Mama. I just call it home.\nThe outer skin is a transparent, flexible organic membrane. You can see right through to the central organ systems. The surrounding bladders and sinuses provide structure and protection. Balloons inside a bigger balloon, filled with helium and hydrogen. The whole organism ripples with iridescence.\nWe live in the helium-filled sinuses. If you get close enough, you can see us moving around inside. We\u2019re the dark spots.\nWhile Ricci slept, I called everyone to the rumpus room for a quick status check. All seven of us lounged in the netting, enjoying the free flowing oxygen/hydrogen mix, goggles and breathers dangling around our necks.\nI led the discussion, as usual. Nobody else can ever be bothered.\n\u201cThoughts?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cRicci seems okay,\u201d said Eddy. \u201cAnd I like what\u2019s-her-name. The mole on the comm.\u201d\n\u201cJane. Yeah, pretty smile,\u201d said Bouche. \u201cRicci\u2019s fine. Right Vula?\u201d\nVula frowned and crossed her arms. She\u2019d hooked into the netting right next to the hatch and looked about ready to stomp out.\n\u201cI guess,\u201d she said. \u201cRude, though.\u201d\n\u201cShe was just trying to be funny,\u201d said Treasure. \u201cI can never predict who\u2019ll stick and who\u2019ll bounce. I thought Chara would claw her way back down belowground. Right through the skin and nosedive home.\u201d\nChara grinned. \u201cI still might.\u201d\nWe laughed, but the camaraderie felt forced. Vula had everyone on edge.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll all keep an eye on Ricci until she settles in,\u201d Eleanora said. \u201cAre we good here? I need to get back to training. I got a chess tournament, you know.\u201d\n\u201cYou always have a tournament.\u201d I surveyed the faces around me, but it didn\u2019t look like anyone wanted to chat.\n\u201cAs long as nobody hogs the uplink, I never have any problems,\u201d said Bouche. \u201cWho\u2019s training Ricci?\u201d\n\u201cWho do you think?\u201d I said. We have a rule. Whoever scared off the last one has to train the replacement.\nWe all looked at Vula.\n\u201cShit,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate training newbies.\u201d\n\u201cStop running them off then,\u201d said Chara. \u201cBe nice.\u201d\nVula scowled, fierce frown lines scoring her forehead. \u201cI\u2019ve got important work to do.\u201d\nNo use arguing with Vula. She was deep in a creative tangle, and had been for a while.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d I said. \u201cWe better train Ricci right if we want her to stick.\u201d\nWhen Ricci woke up, I helped her out of the hammock and showed her how to operate the hygiene station. As soon as she\u2019d hosed off the funk, she called Jane on her appliance.\n\u201cTake off your breather for a moment,\u201d Jane said. \u201cGoggles too. I need to see your face.\u201d\nRicci wedged her fingernails under the seal and pried off her breather. She lifted her goggles. When she grinned, deep dimples appeared on each cheek.\nJane squinted at her through the screen. She nodded, and Ricci replaced the breather. It attached to her skin with a slurp.\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Ricci asked. \u201cNormal enough for you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the failure rate on that thing?\u201d\n\u201cLow,\u201d Ricci said.\nPoint two three percent. Which is low unless you\u2019re talking about death. Then it\u2019s high. But we have spares galore. Safety nests here, there, and everywhere. I could have chimed in with the info but Jane didn\u2019t want to hear from me. I stayed well back and let Ricci handle her friend.\n\u201cHas anyone ever studied the long-term effects of living in a helium atmosphere?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cIt can\u2019t be healthy.\u201d\n\u201cEyes are a problem.\u201d Ricci tapped a finger on a goggle lens. \u201cCorneas need oxygen so that\u2019s why we wear these. The hammocks are filled with air, so we basically bathe in oxygen while we\u2019re sleeping. But you\u2019re right. Without that the skin begins to slough.\u201d\nJane made a face. \u201cUgh.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s air in the common area, too\u2014they call it the rumpus room. That\u2019s where they keep the fab and extruder. I\u2019m supposed to be there now. I have to eat and then do an orientation session. Health, safety, all that good stuff.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to take some time to get to know your hab-mates, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI met them when I got here.\u201d\n\u201cOne of them is Vula, the artist, right? The sculptor. She\u2019s got to be interesting.\u201d\nRicci shrugged. \u201cShe looked grumpy.\u201d\nI was impressed. Pretty perceptive for someone who\u2019d been half-drowned in anesthetic.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s scheduled after training?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. That\u2019s the whole point of coming here, right?\u201d\n\u201cI wondered if you remembered.\u201d A smile broke over Jane\u2019s face, star-bright even when glimpsed on a small screen at a distance. \u201cYou need rest and recreation.\u201d\n\u201cRelaxation and reading,\u201d Ricci added.\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019ll take up a hobby.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I will,\u201d said Ricci. \u201cCount on it.\u201d\nYes, I was spying on Ricci. We all were. She seemed like a good egg, but with no recourse to on-the-spot conflict intervention, we play it safe with newbies until they settle in. Anyone who doesn\u2019t like it can pull down a temporary privacy veil to shield themselves from the bugs, but most don\u2019t bother. Ricci didn\u2019t.\nPlus we needed a distraction.\nWhether it\u2019s half a million moles in a hole down belowground or eight of us floating around in the atmosphere, every hab goes through ups and downs. We\u2019d been down for a while. Some of it was due to Vula\u2019s growly mood, the worst one we\u2019d seen for a while, but really, we just needed a shake-up. Whether we realized it or not, we were all looking to Ricci to deliver us from ourselves.\nDuring orientation, Ricci and I had company. Bouche and Eddy claimed they needed a refresher and tagged along for the whole thing. Chara, Treasure, and Eleanora joined us halfway through. Even Vula popped out of her hab for a few moments, and actually made an effort to look friendly.\nWith all the all the chatter and distraction, I wasn\u2019t confident Ricci\u2019s orientation had stuck, so I shadowed her on her first maintenance rotation. The workflow is fully documented, every detail supported by nested step-by-steps and supervised by dedicated project management bugs that help take human error out of the equation. But I figured she deserved a little extra attention.\nLife support is our first priority, always. We clear the air printers, run live tests on the carbon dioxide digesters, and ground-truth the readings on every single sensor. It\u2019s a tedious process, but not even Vula complains. She likes to breathe as much as any of us.\nRicci was sharp. Interested. Not just in the systems that keep us alive, but in the whole organism, its biology, behavior, and habitat. She was even interested in the clouds around and the icy, slushy landscape below. She wanted to know about the weather patterns, wind, atmospheric layers\u2014everything. I answered as best I could, but I was out of the conversational habit.\nThat, and something about the line of her jaw had me tongue-tied.\n\u201cAm I asking too many questions, Doc?\u201d she asked as we stumped back to the rumpus room after checking the last hammock.\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep to the life-and-death stuff for now,\u201d I said.\nWater harvesting is the next priority. To get it, we have to rise to the aquapause. There bright sunlight condenses moisture on the skin and collects in the dorsal runnels, where we tap it for storage.\nAccess to the main inflation gland is just under the rumpus room. Ricci squeezed through the elasticized access valve. The electrostatic membrane pulled her hair into spikes that waved at the PM bots circling her head. I stayed outside and watched her smear hormone ointment on the marbled surface of the gland. Sinuses creaked as bladders began to expand. As we walked through the maze of branching sinuses, I showed her how to brace against the roll and use the momentum to pull herself through the narrow access slots. Once we got to the ring-shaped fore cavity, we hooked our limbs into the netting and waited.\nRainbows rippled across the expanded bladder surfaces. We were nearly spherical, petals furled, and the wind rolled us like an untethered balloon. The motion makes some newbies sick, and they have to dial up anti-nauseant. Not Ricci. She looked around with anticipation, as if she were expecting to see something amazing rise over the vast horizon.\n\u201cDo you ever run into other whales?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t much care for that term,\u201d I said. It came out gruffer than I intended.\nA dimple appeared at the edge of her breather. \u201cHave you been out here long, Doc?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Ask me an important question.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She waved her hand at the water kegs nested at the bottom of the netting, collapsed into a pile of honeycomb folds. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you carry more water?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good question. You don\u2019t need me to tell you though. You can figure it out. Flip through your dash.\u201d\nThe dimple got deeper. Behind her darkened goggles, her eyelids flickered as she reviewed her dashboards. Naturally it took a little while; our setup was new to her. I rested my chin on my forearms and waited.\nShe surfaced quicker than I expected.\n\u201cMass budget, right? Water is heavy.\u201d\n\u201cYes. The mass dashboard also tracks our inertia. If we get too heavy, we can\u2019t maneuver. And heavy things are dangerous. Everything\u2019s tethered and braced, and we have safety nets. But if something got loose, it could punch through a bladder wall. Even through the skin, easy.\u201d\nRicci looked impressed. \u201cI won\u2019t tell Jane about that.\u201d\nWe popped into the aquapause. The sun was about twenty degrees above the horizon. Its clear orange light glanced across the thick violet carpet of helium clouds below. Overhead, the indigo sky rippled with stars.\nBit of a shock for a mole. I let Ricci ogle the stars for a while. Water ran off the skin, a rushing, cascading sound like one of the big fountains down belowground. I cleared my throat. Ricci startled, eyes wide behind her goggles, then she climbed out of the netting and flipped the valve on the overhead tap. Silver water dribbled through the hose and into the battery of kegs, slowing the expanding pleated walls.\nRicci didn\u2019t always fill the quiet spaces with needless chatter. I liked that. We worked in silence until the kegs were nearly full, and when she began to question me again, I welcomed it.\n\u201cEddy said you were one of the first out here,\u201d Ricci said. \u201cYou figured out how to make this all work.\u201d\nI answered with a grunt, and then cursed myself. If I scared her away Vula would never let me forget it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Me and a few others.\u201d\n\u201cYou took a big risk.\u201d\n\u201cMoving into the atmosphere was inevitable,\u201d I said. \u201cHumans are opportunistic organisms. If there\u2019s a viable habitat, we\u2019ll colonize it.\u201d\n\u201cTakes a lot of imagination to see this as viable.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. Or maybe desperation. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s better than down belowground. Down there, you can\u2019t move without stepping on someone. Every breath is measured and every minute is optimized for resource resilience. That might be viable, but it\u2019s not human.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not arguing.\u201d Ricci\u2019s voice pitched low, thick with emotion as she gazed at the stars in that deep sky. \u201cI love it here.\u201d\nYeah, she wasn\u2019t a mole anymore. She was one of us already.\nOne by one, the kegs filled and began flexing through their purification routine. We called in the crablike water bots and ran them through a sterilization cycle.\nWater work done, the next task was spot-checking the equipment nests. I let Ricci take the lead, stayed well back as she jounced through the cavities and sinuses. She was enthusiastic, confident. Motivated, even. Most newbies stay hunkered in their hammocks for a lot longer than her.\nWe circled back to the rumpus room, inventoried the nutritional feedstock, and began running tests on the hygiene bots. I settled into the netting and watched Ricci pull a crispy snack out of the extruder.\n\u201cYou must know all the other crews. The ones who live in the . . . \u201d Ricci struggled to frame the concept without offending me.\n\u201cYou can call them whales if you want. I don\u2019t like it, but I\u2019ve never managed to find a better word.\u201d\nShe passed me a bulb of cold caffeine.\n\u201cHow often do you talk to the people who live in the other whales, Doc?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything to do with them. Not anymore.\u201d\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\u201cThe whole reason we came out here is so we don\u2019t have to put up with anyone else\u2019s crap.\u201d\n\u201cYou never see the other whales at all? Not even at a distance?\u201d\nI drained the bulb. \u201cThese organisms don\u2019t have any social behavior.\u201d\n\u201cBut you must have to talk to them sometimes, don\u2019t you? Share info or troubleshoot?\u201d\nI collapsed the bulb in my fist and threw it to a hygiene bot.\n\u201cYou lonely already?\u201d\nRicci tossed her head back and laughed, a full belly guffaw. \u201cCome on, Doc. You have to admit that\u2019s weird.\u201d\nShe was relentless. \u201cGo ahead and make friends with the others if you want,\u201d I growled. \u201cJust don\u2019t believe everything they say. They\u2019ve got their own ways of doing things, and so do we.\u201d\nWe checked the internal data repeaters and then spent the rest of the shift calibrating and testing the sensor array\u2014all the infrastructure that traps the data we sell to the atmospheric monitoring firms. I kept my mouth shut. Ricci maintained an aggressive cheerfulness even though I was about as responsive as a bot. But my glacier-like chilliness\u2014more than ten years in the making\u2014couldn\u2019t resist her. My hermit heart was already starting to thaw.\nIf I\u2019d been the one calling Jane every day, I would have told her the light is weird out here. We stay within the optimal thermal range, near the equator where the winds are comparatively warm and the solar radiation helps keep the temperature in our habitat relatively viable. That means we\u2019re always in daylight, running a race against nightfall, which is good for Mama but not so good for us. Humans evolved to exist in a day-night cycle and something goes haywire in our brains when we mess with that. So our goggles simulate our chosen ratio of light and dark.\nMe, I like to alternate fifty-fifty but I\u2019ll fool with the mix every so often just to shake things up. Vula likes the night so she keeps things dimmer than most. Everyone\u2019s different. That\u2019s what the moles don\u2019t realize, how different some of us are.\n\u201cI did a little digging, and what I found out scared me,\u201d Jane said the next time Ricci checked in. \u201cTurns out there\u2019s huge gaps in atmospheric research. The only area that\u2019s really well monitored is the equator, and only around the beanstalk. Everywhere else, analysis is done by hobbyists who donate a few billable hours here and there.\u201d\nRicci nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what Doc said.\u201d\nHearing my name perked me right up. I slapped down two of my open streams and gave their feed my whole attention.\n\u201cNobody really knows that much about the organism you\u2019re living inside. Even less about the climate out there, and nearly nothing about the geography, not in detail. I never would have supported this decision if I\u2019d realized how . . . \u201d Jane\u2019s pretty face contorted as she searched for the word. \u201cHow willy-nilly the whole situation is. It\u2019s not safe. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s even allowed.\u201d\n\u201cAllowed? Who can stop us? People go where they want.\u201d\n\u201cNot if it\u2019s dangerous. You can\u2019t just walk into a sewage treatment facility or air purification plant. It\u2019s unethical to allow people to endanger themselves.\u201d\nRicci snorted, fouling the valves on her breather and forcing her to take a big gulp of helium through her mouth.\n\u201cNot all of us want to be safe, Jane.\u201d The helium made her voice squeaky.\nJane\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cDon\u2019t mock me. I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ricci squeaked. She exhaled to clear her lungs and took a deep slow breath through her nose. Her voice dropped to its normal register. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve only been here a few days.\u201d\n\u201cSix,\u201d Jane said.\n\u201cIf I see anything dangerous, you\u2019ll be the first to know. Until then, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine. Better than fine. I\u2019m even sleeping. A lot.\u201d\nThat was a lie. The air budget showed Ricci hadn\u2019t seen much of the inside of her hammock. But I wasn\u2019t worried. Exhaustion would catch up with her eventually.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking around about your hab-mates.\u201d\n\u201cVula\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just that lately none of her work has turned out the way she wants. You know artists. Their professional standards are always unreachable. Set themselves up to fail.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about Vula, it\u2019s Doc.\u201d\nRicci bounced in her netting. \u201cOh yeah? Tell me. Because I can\u2019t get a wink out of that one. Totally impervious.\u201d\nI maximized the feed to fill my entire visual field. In the tiny screen in Ricci\u2019s hand, Jane\u2019s dark hair trailed strands across her face and into her mouth. She pushed them back with an impatient flick of her fingers. She was in an atrium, somewhere with stiff air circulation. I could just make out seven decks of catwalk arching behind her, swarming with pedestrians.\n\u201cPull down a veil,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou might have lurkers.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Ricci answered. \u201cFour at least. I\u2019m the most entertaining thing inside Mama for quite a while. It doesn\u2019t bother me. Let them lurk.\u201d\nBut Jane insisted, so Ricci pulled down a privacy veil and the bug feed winked out.\nI told myself whatever Jane had found out didn\u2019t matter. It would bear no relation to reality. That\u2019s how gossip works\u2014especially gossip about ancient history. But even so, a little hole opened up under my breastbone, and it ached.\nOnly six days and I already cared what Ricci thought. I wanted her to like me. So I set about trying to give her a reason.\nA few days later, we drifted into a massive storm system. Ricci\u2019s first big one. I didn\u2019t want her to miss it, so I bounced aft and hallooed to her at a polite distance from her hab. She was lounging in her netting, deep in multiple streams, twisting a lock of her short brown hair around her finger.\nShe looked happy enough to see me. No wariness behind her gaze, no chill.\nWe settled in to watch the light show. It was an eye-catcher. Bolts zagged to the peaks of the ice towers below, setting the fog alight with expanding patches of emerald green and acid magenta.\nTwo big bolts forked overhead with a mighty whump. Ricci didn\u2019t even jump.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.\nI was going to stay silently mysterious, but then remembered I was trying to be friendly.\n\u201cThat,\u201d I said, \u201cwas lunch.\u201d\nA dark splotch began to coalesce at the spot where the two bolts had caressed each other, a green and violet pastel haze in the thin milky fog. We banked slowly, bladders groaning, massive sinus walls clicking as we changed shape to ride the wind currents up, up, and then the massive body flexed just enough to reveal two petals reaching into the coalescing bacteria bloom.\nRicci launched herself out of the netting and clung to the side of her hab, trying to get a better view of the feeding behavior. When the bloom dissipated, she turned to me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all it does, this whale? Just search for food?\u201d\n\u201cEat, drink, and see the sights,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat else does anyone need from life?\u201d\nGood company, I thought, but I didn\u2019t say it.\nThe light show went on for hours. Ricci was fascinated from start to finish. Me, I didn\u2019t see it. I spent the whole storm watching the light illuminate her face.\nWhat else does anyone need from life? That was me trying to be romantic. Clumsy. Also inaccurate.\nWhen we first moved out here, my old friends and I thought our habs would eventually become self-contained. Experience killed that illusion pretty quick. We\u2019re almost as dependent on the planetary civil apparatus as anyone.\nWithout feedstock, for example, we\u2019d either starve or suffocate\u2014not sure which would happen first. It has a lot of mass, so we can\u2019t stockpile much.\nThen there\u2019s power. Funding it is a challenge when you\u2019re supplying eight people as opposed to eight million. No economy of scale in a hab this size. It\u2019s not the power feed itself that\u2019s the problem, but the infrastructure. We\u2019re always on the move, so the feed has to follow us around and provide multiple points of redundancy. Our ambient power supply costs base market value plus a massive buy-back on the research and development.\nData has to follow us around too, but we don\u2019t bother with redundancy. It\u2019s not critical. You\u2019d think it was more important than air, though, if you saw us when the data goes down. Shrieking. Curses. Bouche just about catatonic (she\u2019s a total media junkie). Eleanora wall-eyed with panic especially if she\u2019s in the middle of a tournament (chess is her drug of choice). Vula, Eddy, and me in any state from suave to suicidal depending on what we\u2019re doing when the metaphorical umbilical gets yanked out of our guts.\nTreasure and Chara are the only ones who don\u2019t freak out. Usually they\u2019re too busy boning each other.\nWithout data, we couldn\u2019t stay here, either. If we only had each other to talk to, it\u2019d be a constant drama cycle, but we\u2019re all plugged into the hab cultures down belowground. We\u2019ve got hobbies to groom, projects to tend, performances to cheer, games to play, friends to visit.\nFinally, as an independent political entity, we need brokers and bankers to handle our economic transactions and lawyers to vet our contracts. We all need the occasional look-in from medtechs and physical therapists. And when we need a new crew member, we contract a recruiter.\n\u201cYou look tired,\u201d Jane said the next time Ricci called. \u201cI thought you said you were sleeping.\u201d\nRicci hung upside down in her netting. She\u2019d made friends with the orang. It squatted in front of her, holding the appliance while she chatted with Jane.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been digging through some old work.\u201d She dangled her arms, hooked her fingers in the floor grid, and stretched. \u201cI came up with a new approach to my first dissertation.\u201d\nJane gaped. Her mouth worked like she was blowing bubbles.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ricci added. \u201cI\u2019ll never change, right?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you try that with me.\u201d Jane\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have a choice\u2014\u201d\nRicci raised her hands in mock surrender. \u201cOkay. Take it easy.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014you can keep working on getting better, or you can go back to your old habits.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jane. You\u2019re a great therapist.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me, you idiot,\u201d Jane yelled. \u201cIt\u2019s about you.\u201d\n\u201cI tried, Jane.\u201d Ricci\u2019s voice was soft, ardent. \u201cI really tried. So hard.\u201d\n\u201cI know you did.\u201d Jane sucked in a deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t throw away all your progress.\u201d\nThey went on and on like that. I didn\u2019t listen, just checked in now and then to see if they were still at it. I knew Ricci\u2019s story. I\u2019d read the report from the recruiter. The privacy seal had timed out but I remembered the details.\nRight out of the cr\u00e8che she\u2019d dived into an elite chemical engineering program, the kind every over-fond cr\u00e8che manager wants for their favorite little geniuses. Sound good, doesn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t that where you\u2019d want to put your little Omi or Occam, little Carey or Karim? But what cr\u00e8che managers don\u2019t realize\u2014because their world is full of guided discovery opportunities and subconscious learning stimuli\u2014is that high-prestige programs are grinders. Go ahead, dump a cr\u00e8che-full of young brilliants inside. Some of them won\u2019t come out whole.\nI know; I went through one myself.\nWhen Ricci crashed out of the chem program within spitting distance of an advanced degree, she bounced to protein engineering. She did a lot of good work there before she cracked. Then she moved into pharmaceutical modeling. A few more years of impressive productivity before it all went up in smoke. By that time she wasn\u2019t young anymore. The damage had accumulated. Her endocrinologist suggested intensive peer counseling might stop the carnage, so in stepped Jane, who applied her pretty smile, her patience, and all her active listening skills to try to gently guide Ricci along a course of life that didn\u2019t include cooking her brain until it scrambled.\nAt the end of that long conversation through the appliance, Ricci agreed to put her old work under lockdown so she could concentrate on the here-and-now. Which meant all her attention was focused on us.\nRicci got into my notes. I don\u2019t keep them locked down; anyone can access them. Free and open distribution of data is a primary force behind the success of the human species, after all. Don\u2019t we all learn that in the cr\u00e8che?\nMaking data available doesn\u2019t guarantee anyone will look at it, and if they do, chances are they won\u2019t understand it. Ricci tried. She didn\u2019t just skim through, she really studied. Shift after shift, she played with the numbers and gamed my simulation models. Maybe she slept. Maybe not.\nI figured Ricci would come looking for me if she got stumped, so I de-hermited, banged around in the rumpus room, put myself to work on random little maintenance tasks.\nWhen Ricci found me, I was in the caudal stump dealing with the accumulated waste pellets. Yes, that\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: half-kilogram plugs of dry solid waste covered in wax and transferred from the lavs by the hygiene bots. Liquid waste is easy. We vaporize it, shunt it into the gas exchange bladder, and flush it through gill-like permeable membranes. Solid waste, well, just like anyone we\u2019d rather forget about it as long as possible. We rack the pellets until there\u2019s about two hundred, then we jettison them.\nRicci pushed up her goggles and scrubbed knuckles over her red-rimmed eyes.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you automate this process like you do for liquids?\u201d Ricci asked as she helped me position the rack over the valve.\n\u201cNo room for non-essential equipment in the mass budget,\u201d I said.\nI dilated the interior shutter and the first pellet clicked through. A faint pink blush formed around the valve\u2019s perimeter, only visible because I\u2019d dialed up the contrast on my goggles to watch for signs of stress. A little hormone ointment took care of it\u2014not too much or we\u2019d get a band of inflexible scar tissue, and then I\u2019d have to cut out the valve and move it to another location. That\u2019s a long, tricky process and it\u2019s not fun.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only two bands of tissue strong enough to support a valve.\u201d I bent down and stroked the creamy striated tissue at my feet. \u201cThis is number two, and really, it barely holds. We have to treat it gently.\u201d\n\u201cWhy risk it, then? Take it out and just use the main valve.\u201d\nA sarcastic comment bubbled up\u2014have you never heard of a safety exit?\u2014but I gazed into her big brown eyes and it faded into the clouds.\n\u201cWe need two valves in case of emergencies,\u201d I mumbled.\nRicci and I watched the pellets plunge through the sky. When they hit the ice slush, the concussive wave kicked up a trail of vapor blooms, concentric rings lit with pinpoints of electricity, so far below each flash just a spark in a violet sea.\nA flock of jellies fled from the concussion, flat shells strobing with reflected light, trains of ribbon-like tentacles flapping behind.\nRicci looked worried. \u201cDid we hit any of them?\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cNo, they can move fast.\u201d\nAfter we\u2019d finished dumping waste, Ricci said, \u201cSay, Doc, why don\u2019t you show me the main valve again?\u201d\nI puffed up a little at that. I\u2019m proud of the valves. Always tinkering, always innovating, always making them a little better. Without the valves, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\nFar forward, just before the peduncle isthmus, a wide band of filaments connects the petals to the bladder superstructure. The isthmus skin is thick with connective tissue, and provides enough structural integrity to support a valve big enough to accommodate a cargo pod.\n\u201cWe pulled you in here.\u201d I patted the collar of the shutter housing. \u201cWhoever prepared the pod had put you in a pink body bag. Don\u2019t know why it was such a ridiculous color. When Vula saw it, she said, \u2018It\u2019s a girl!\u2019.\u201d\nI laughed. Ricci winced.\n\u201cThat joke makes sense, old style,\u201d I explained.\n\u201cNo, I get it. Birth metaphor. I\u2019m not a crechie, Doc.\u201d\n\u201cI know. We wouldn\u2019t have picked you if you were.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you pick me?\u201d\nI grumbled something. Truth is, when I ask our recruiter to find us a new hab-mate, the percentage of viable applications approaches zero. We look for a specific psychological profile. The two most important success factors are low self-censoring and high focus. People who say what they think are never going to ambush you with long-fermented resentments, and obsessive people don\u2019t get bored. They know how to make their own fun.\nRicci tapped her fingernail on a shutter blade.\n\u201cYour notes aren\u2019t complete, Doc.\u201d She stared up at me, unblinking. No hint of a dimple. \u201cWhy are you hoarding information?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you are. There\u2019s nothing about reproduction.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t know very much about it.\u201d\n\u201cThe other whale crews do. And they\u2019re worried about it. You must know something, but you\u2019re not sharing. Why?\u201d\nI glared at her. \u201cI\u2019m an amateur independent researcher. My methods aren\u2019t rigorous. It would be wrong to share shaky theories.\u201d\n\u201cThe whale crews had a collective research agreement once. You wrote it.\u201d\nShe fired the document at me with a flick of her finger. I slapped it down and flushed it from my buffer.\n\u201cThat agreement expired. We didn\u2019t renew.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. You dissolved it and left to find your own whale.\u201d\nI aimed my finger at the bridge of her goggles and jabbed the air. \u201cYes, I ran away. So did you.\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cI left a network of habs with a quarter billion people who can all do just fine without me. You ran from a few hundred who need you.\u201d\nRunning away is something I\u2019m good at. I bounced out of there double-time. Ricci didn\u2019t call after me. I wouldn\u2019t have answered if she had.\nThe next time she talked to Jane, Ricci didn\u2019t mention me. I guess I didn\u2019t rate high enough on her list of problems. I didn\u2019t really listen to the details as they chatted. I just liked having their voices in my head while I tinkered with my biosynthesis simulations.\nHalfway through their session, Vula pinged me.\nYou can quit spying, she said. None of us are worried about Ricci anymore.\nI agreed, and shut down the feed.\nRicci\u2019s been asking about you, by the way, Vula added. Your history with the other whales.\nTell her everything.\nYou sure?\nI\u2019ve been spying on her for days. It\u2019s only fair.\nBetter she heard the story from Vula than me. I still can\u2019t talk about it without overheating, and they tell me I\u2019m scary when I\u2019m angry.\nDown belowground the air is thick with rules written and unwritten, the slowly decaying husks of thirty thousand years of human history dragged behind us from Earth, and the most important of these is cooperation for mutual benefit. Humans being human, that\u2019s only possible in conditions of resource abundance\u2014not just actual numerical abundance, but more importantly, the perception of abundance. When humans are confident there\u2019s enough to go around, life is easy and we all get along, right?\nHa.\nCooperation makes life possible, but never easy. Humans are hard to wrangle. Tell them to do one thing and they\u2019ll do the opposite more often than not. One thing we all agree on is that everyone wants a better life. Only problem is, nobody can agree what that means.\nSo we have an array of habs offering a wide variety of socio-cultural options. If you don\u2019t like what your hab offers, you can leave and find one that does. If there isn\u2019t one, you can try to find others who want the same things as you and start your own. Often, just knowing options are available keeps people happy.\nNot everyone, though.\nDown belowground, I simply hated knowing my every breath was counted, every kilojoule measured, every moment of service consumption or contribution accounted for in the transparent economy, every move modeled by human capital managers and adjusted by resource optimization analysts. I got obsessed with the numbers in my debt dashboard; even though it was well into the black all I wanted to do was drive it up as high and as fast as I could, so nobody would ever be able to say I hadn\u2019t done my part.\nMost people never think about their debt. They drop a veil over the dash and live long, happy, ignorant lives, never caring about their billable rate and never knowing whether or not they siphoned off the efforts of others. But for some of us, that debt counter becomes an obsession.\nAn obsession and ultimately an albatross, chained around our necks.\nI dreamed about an independent habitat with abundant space and unlimited horizons. And I wasn\u2019t the only one. When we looked, there it was, floating around the atmosphere.\nWas it dangerous? Sure. But a few firms provide services to risk takers and they\u2019re always eager for new clients. The crews that shuttle ice climbers to the poles delivered us to the skin of a very large whale. I made the first cut myself.\nSolving the problems of life was exhilarating\u2014air, food, water, warmth. We were explorers, just like the mountain climbers of old, ascending the highest peaks wearing nothing but animal hides. Like the first humans. Revolutionary.\nOur success attracted others, and our population grew. We colonized new whales and once we got settled, our problems became more mundane. I have a little patience for administrative details, but the burden soon became agonizing. Unending meetings to chew over our collective agreements, measuring and accounting and debits and credits and assigning value to everyone\u2019s time. This was exactly what we\u2019d escaped. Little more than one year in the clouds, and we were reinventing all the old problems from scratch.\nNobody needs that.\nI stood right in the middle of the rumpus room inside the creature I\u2019d cut into with my own hands and gave an impassioned speech about the nature of freedom and independence, and reminded them all of the reasons we\u2019d left. If they wanted their value micro-accounted, they could go right back down belowground.\nI thought it was a good speech, but apparently not. When it came to a vote, I was the only one blocking consensus.\nI believe\u2014hand-to-heart\u2014if they\u2019d only listened to me and did what I said everything would have been fine and everyone would have been happy. But some people can never really be happy unless they\u2019re making other people miserable. They claimed I was trying to use my seniority, skills, and experience as a lever to exert political force. I\u2019d become a menace. And when they told me I had to submit to psychological management, I left.\nTurned out we\u2019d brought the albatross along with us, after all.\nWhen Jane pinged me a few days later, I was doing the same thing as millions down belowground\u2014watching a newly-arrived arts delegation process down the beanstalk and marveling at their dramatic clothing and prosthetics.\nI pinged her back right away. Even though I knew she would probably needle me about my past, I didn\u2019t hesitate. I missed having Ricci and Jane in my head, and life was a bit lonely without them. Also, I was eager to meet her. I wasn\u2019t the only one; the whole crew was burning with curiosity about Ricci\u2019s pretty friend.\nWhen Jane\u2019s fake melted into reality, she was dressed in a shiny black party gown. Long dark hair pouffed over her shoulders, held off her face with little spider clips that gathered the locks into tufts. Her chair was a spider model too, with eight delicate ruby and onyx legs that cradled her torso.\n\u201cHi, Doc,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, finally. I\u2019m a friend of Ricci\u2019s. I think you know that, though.\u201d\nA friend. Not a therapist, peer counselor, or emotional health consultant. That was odd. And then it dawned on me: Jane had been donating her time ever since Ricci joined us. She probably wanted to formalize her contract, start racking up the billable hours.\nWhen I glanced through her metadata, and my heart began to hammer. Jane\u2019s rate was sky high.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t float your rate,\u201d I blurted. \u201cNot now. Maybe eventually. But we\u2019d have to find another revenue stream.\u201d\nJane\u2019s head jerked back and her gaze narrowed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I pinged you,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about staying billable\u2014I never did. All I want to do is help people.\u201d\nI released a silent sigh of relief. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. I just wanted to say hi and ask how Ricci\u2019s getting along.\u201d\n\u201cRicci\u2019s fine. Nothing to worry about.\u201d I always get gruff around beautiful women.\nShe brightened. \u201cShe\u2019s fitting in with you all?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. One of the crew. She\u2019s great. I love her.\u201d I bit my lip and quickly added, \u201cI mean we all like her. Even Vula, and she\u2019s picky.\u201d\nI blushed. Badly. Jane noticed, and a gentle smile touched the corners of her mouth. But she was a kind soul and changed the subject.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering something, Doc. Do you mind if I ask a personal question?\u201d\nI scrubbed my hands over my face in embarrassment and nodded.\nShe wheeled her chair a bit closer and tilted toward me. \u201cDo you know what gave you the idea to move to the surface? I mean originally, before you\u2019d ever started looking into the possibility.\u201d\n\u201cHave you read Zane Grey\u2019s Riders of the Purple Sage?\u201d I asked. \u201cYou must have.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d She looked confused, like I was changing the subject.\n\u201cYou should. Here.\u201d\nI tossed her a multi-bookmark compilation. Back down belowground, I\u2019d given them out like candy at a cr\u00e8che party. She could puzzle through the diction of the ancient original or read it in any number of translations, listen to a variety of audio versions and dramatic readings, or watch any of the hundreds of entertainment docs it had inspired. I\u2019d seen them all.\n\u201cThis is really old. Why did you think I\u2019d know it?\u201d She flipped to the summary. \u201cOh, I see. One of the characters is named is Jane.\u201d\n\u201cRead it. It explains everything.\u201d\n\u201cI will. But maybe you could tell me what to look for?\u201d Her smile made me forget all about my embarrassment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about what humans need to be happy. Sure, we evolved to live in complex interdependent social groups, but before that, we were nomads, pursuing resource opportunities in an open, sparsely populated landscape. That means for some people, solitude and independence are primary values.\u201d\nShe nodded, and I could see she was trying hard to understand.\n\u201cDown belowground, when I was figuring all this out, I tried working with a therapist. When I told him this, he said, \u2018We also evolved to suffer and die from violence, disease, and famine. Do you miss that, too?\u2019\u201d\nJane laughed. \u201cI hope you fired him. So one book inspired all this?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a book. It\u2019s a way of life. The freedom to explore wide open spaces, to come together with like-minded others and form loose knit communities based on mutual aid, and to know that every morning you\u2019ll wake up looking at an endless horizon.\u201d\n\u201cThese horizons aren\u2019t big enough?\u201d She waved at the surrounding virtual space, a default grid with dappled patterns, as if a directional light source were shining through gently fluttering leaves.\n\u201cFor some, maybe. For me, pretending isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll read it. It sounds very . . . \u201d She pursed her lips, looking for the right word. \u201cRomantic.\u201d\nI started to blush again, so I made an excuse and dropped the connection before I made a fool of myself. Then I drifted down to the rumpus room and stripped off my goggles and breather.\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d Bouche said. \u201cDoc, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nEleanora turned from the extruder to look at me, then fumbled her caffeine bulb and squirted liquid across her cheek.\n\u201cWow.\u201d She wiped the liquid up with her sleeve. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you look dreamy before. What happened?\u201d\nI\u2019m in love, I thought.\n\u201cJane pinged me,\u201d I said instead.\nBouche called the whole crew. They came at a run. Even Vula.\nIn a small hab, any crumb of gossip can become legendary. I made them beg for the story, then drew it out as long as I could.\n\u201cCan you ask her to ping me?\u201d Eddy asked Ricci when I was done.\n\u201cI would chat with her for more than a couple minutes, unlike Doc,\u201d said Treasure.\nChara grinned lasciviously. \u201cCan I lurk?\u201d\nThe whole crew in one room, awake and actually talking to each other was something Ricci hadn\u2019t seen before, much less all of us howling with laughter and gossiping about her friend. She looked profoundly unsettled. Vula bounced over to the extruder, filled a bulb with her favorite social lubricant, and tossed it to Ricci.\n\u201cTell us everything about Jane,\u201d Chara said. Treasure waggled her tongue.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d Ricci frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s a friend.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d they chorused, and collapsed back onto the netting, giggling.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to ask\u2014why do you use that hand-held thing to talk to her, anyway?\u201d Chara said. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen one of those before.\u201d\nRicci shook her head.\n\u201cCome on, Ricci. There\u2019s no privacy here,\u201d Vula said. \u201cYou know that. Don\u2019t go stiff on us.\u201d\nRicci joined us in the netting before answering. When she picked a spot beside me, my pulse fluttered in my throat.\n\u201cJane\u2019s a peer counselor.\u201d She squeezed a sip from the bulb and grimaced at the taste. \u201cThe hand-held screen is one of her strategies. Having it around reminds me to keep working on my goals.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you need peer counseling?\u201d asked Chara.\n\u201cBecause I . . . \u201d Ricci looked from face to face, big brown eyes serious. Everyone quieted down. \u201cI was unhappy. Listen, I\u2019ve been talking with some people from the other whale crews. They\u2019ve been having problems for a while now, and it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d\nShe fired a stack of bookmarks into the middle of the room. Everyone began riffling through them, except me.\n\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d I said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s going on, Doc?\u201d asked Chara.\nI folded my arms and scowled in the general direction of the extruder.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit about them.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you better,\u201d Vula said. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s happening to them, it could happen to us. Look.\u201d\nShe fired a feed from a remote sensing drone into the middle of the room. A group of whales had gathered a hundred meters above a slushy depression between a pair of high ridges. They weren\u2019t feeding, just drifting around aimlessly, dangerously close to each other. When they got close to each other, they unfurled their petals and brushed them along each other\u2019s skin.\nAs we watched, two whales collided. Their bladders bubbled out like a crechie\u2019s squeeze toy until it looked like they would burst. Seeing the two massive creatures collide like that was so upsetting, I actually reached into the feed and tried to push them apart. Embarrassing.\n\u201cCome on Doc, tell us what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Vula.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I tucked my hands into my armpits as if I was cold.\n\u201cWe should go help,\u201d said Eddy. \u201cAt least we could assist with the evac if they need to bail.\u201d\nI shook my head. \u201cIt could be dangerous.\u201d\nEveryone laughed at that. People who aren\u2019t comfortable with risk don\u2019t roam the atmosphere.\n\u201cIt might be a disease,\u201d I added, \u201cWe should stay as far away as we can. We don\u2019t want to catch it.\u201d\nTreasure pulled a face at me. \u201cYou\u2019re getting old.\u201d\nI grabbed my breather and goggles and bounded toward the hatch.\n\u201cCome on Doc, take a guess,\u201d Ricci said.\n\u201cMore observation would be required before I\u2019d be comfortable advancing a theory,\u201d I said stiffly. \u201cI can only offer conjecture.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead, conjecture away,\u201d said Vula.\nI took a moment to collect myself, and then turned and addressed the crew with professorial gravity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible the other crews haven\u2019t been maintaining the interventions that ensure their whales don\u2019t move into reproductive maturity.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying the whales are horny?\u201d said Bouche.\n\u201cThey look horny,\u201d said Treasure.\n\u201cThey\u2019re fascinated with each other,\u201d said Vula.\nVula had put her finger on exactly the thing that was bothering me. Whales don\u2019t congregate. They don\u2019t interact socially. They certainly don\u2019t mate.\n\u201cI\u2019d guess the applicable pseudoneural tissue has regenerated, perhaps incompletely, and their behavior is confused.\u201d\nRicci gestured at the feed, where three whales collided, dragging their petals across each other\u2019s bulging skin. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to happen to us?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I said. \u201cDefinitely not. Don\u2019t worry. Unlike the others, I\u2019ve been keeping on top of the situation.\u201d\n\u201cBut how can you be sure?\u201d And then realization dawned over Ricci\u2019s face. \u201cYou knew this was going to happen, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cNot exactly.\u201d\nShe launched herself from the netting and bounced toward me. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you share the information? Keeping it secret is just cruel.\u201d\nI backed toward the hatch. \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to save the others from their stupid mistakes.\u201d\n\u201cWe need to tell them how to fix it. Maybe they can save themselves.\u201d\n\u201cTell them whatever you want.\u201d I excavated my private notes from lockdown, and fired them into the middle of the room. \u201cI think their best option would be to abandon their whales and find new ones.\u201d\n\u201cThat would take months,\u201d Vula said. \u201cNineteen whales. More than two hundred people.\u201d\n\u201cThen they should start now.\u201d I turned to leave.\n\u201cWait.\u201d Ricci looked around at the crew. \u201cWe have to go help. Right?\u201d\nI gripped the edge of the hatch. The electrostatic membrane licked at my fingertips.\n\u201cYeah, I want to go,\u201d Bouche said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if you didn\u2019t, Doc.\u201d\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d said Treasure.\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Chara chimed in. Eddy and Eleanora both nodded.\nVula pulled down her goggles and launched herself out of the netting. \u201cWhales fucking? What are we waiting for? I\u2019ll start fabbing some media drones.\u201d\nWith all seven of them eager for adventure, our quiet, comfortable little world didn\u2019t stand a chance.\nWe\u2019re not the only humans on the surface. Not quite. Near the south pole a gang of religious hermits live in a deep ice cave, making alcohol the old way using yeast-based fermentation. It\u2019s no better than the extruded version, but some of the habs take pity on them so the hermits can fund their power and feedstock.\nEvery so often one of the hermits gives up and calls for evac. When that happens, the bored crew of a cargo ship zips down to rescue them. Those same ships bring us supplies and new crew. They also shuttle adventurers and researchers around the planet, but mostly they sit idle, tethered halfway up the beanstalk.\nThe ships are beautiful\u2014sleek, fast, and elegant. As for us, when we need to change our position, it\u2019s not quite so efficient. Or fast.\nWhen Ricci found me in the rumpus room, I\u2019d already fabbed my gloves and face mask, and I was watching the last few centimeters of a thick pair of protective coveralls chug through the output.\n\u201cI told the other crews you\u2019d be happy to take a look at the regenerated tissue and recommend a solution, but they refused,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t like you, do they?\u201d\nI yanked the coveralls out of the extruder.\n\u201cNo, and I don\u2019t like them either.\u201d I stalked to the hatch.\n\u201cCan I tag along, Doc?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t pack you into a body bag and tag you for evac.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Doc. I should have asked you before offering your help. When I get an idea in my head, tend to just run with it.\u201d\nShe was all smiles and dimples, with her goggles on her forehead pushing her hair up in spikes and her breather swinging around her neck. A person who looks like that can get away with anything.\n\u201cThis is your idea,\u201d I said. \u201cOnly fair you get your hands dirty.\u201d\nI fabbed her a set of protective clothing and we helped each other suit up. We took a quick detour to slather appetite suppressant gel on the appropriate hormonal bundle, and then waddled up the long dorsal sinus, arms out for balance. The sinus walls clicked and the long cavity bent around us, but soon the appetite suppressant took hold and we were nearly stationary, dozing gently in the clouds.\nOn either side towered the main float bladders\u2014clear multi-chambered organs rippling with rainbows across their honeycomb-patterned surfaces. Feeder organs pulsed between the bladder walls. The feeders are dark pink at the base, but the color fades as they branch into sprawling networks of tubules reaching through the skin, grasping hydrogen and channeling it into the bladders.\nAt the head of the dorsal sinus, a tall, slot-shaped orifice give us access to the neuronal cavity. I shrugged my equipment bag off my shoulder, and showed Ricci how to secure her face mask over her breather, and climbed in.\nWith the masks on, to talk we had to ping each other. I was still a bit angry so no chit-chat, business only. I handed her the laser scalpel.\nCut right here. I sliced the blade of my gloved hand vertically down the milky surface of the protective tissue. See these scars? I pointed at the gray metallic stripes on either side of the imaginary line I\u2019d drawn. Stay away from them. Just cut straight in between.\nRicci backed away a few steps. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m qualified to do this.\nYou\u2019ve been qualified to draw a line since you were a crechie. When she began to protest again, I cut her off. This was your idea, remember?\nHer hands shook, but the line was straight enough. The pouch deflated, draping over the skeleton of the carbon fiber struts I\u2019d installed way back in the beginning. I pulled Ricci inside and closed the incision behind us with squirts of temporary adhesive. The wound wept drops of fluid that rapidly boiled off, leaving a sticky pink sap-like crust across the iridescent interior surface.\nIs this the whale\u2019s brain? Ricci asked.\nI ignored the question. Ricci knew it was the brain\u2014she\u2019d been studying my notes, after all. She was just trying to smooth my feathers by giving me a chance to show my expertise.\nNot every brain looks like a brain. Yours and mine look like they should be floating in the primordial ocean depths\u2014that\u2019s where we came from, after all. The organ in front of us came from the clouds\u2014a tower of spun glass floss threaded through and through with wispy, feather-like strands that branched and re-branched into iridescent fractals. My mobility control leads were made of copper nanofiber embedded in color-coded silicon filaments: red, green, blue, yellow, purple, orange, and black\u2014a ragged, dull rainbow piercing the delicate depths of an alien brain.\nRicci repeated her question.\nDon\u2019t ask dumb questions, Ricci.\nShe put her hands up in a gesture of surrender and backed away. Not far\u2014no room inside the pouch to shuffle back more than one step.\nThe best I can say is it\u2019s brain-like. I snapped the leads into my fist-sized control interface. The neurons are neuron-like. Is it the whole brain? Is the entire seat of cognition here? I can\u2019t tell because there\u2019s not much cognition to measure. Maybe more than a bacterium, but far less than an insect.\nHow do you measure cognition? Ricci asked.\nControlled experiments, but how do you run experiments on animals this large? All I can tell you is that most people who study these creatures lose interest fast. But here\u2019s a better measure: After more than ten years, a whale has never surprised me.\nBefore today, you mean.\nManeuvering takes a little practice. We use a thumb-operated clicker to fire tiny electrical impulses through the leads and achieve a vague form of directional control. Yes, it\u2019s a basic system. We could replace it with something more elegant but it operates even if we lose power. The control it provides isn\u2019t exactly roll, pitch, and yaw, but it\u2019s effective enough. The margin for error is large. There\u2019s not much to hit.\nNavigation is easy, too. Satellites ping our position a thousand times a second and the data can be accessed in several different navigational aids, all available in our dashboards.\nBut though it\u2019s all fairly easy, it\u2019s not quick. My anger didn\u2019t last long. Not in such close quarters, especially just a few hours after realizing I was in love with her. It was hardly a romantic scene, both of us swathed head-to-toe in protective clothing, passing a navigation controller back and forth as we waggled slowly toward our destination.\nIn between bouts of navigation, I began telling Ricci everything I knew about the organ in front of us: A brain dump about brains, inside a brain. Ha.\nShe was interested; I was flattered by her interest. Age-old story. I treated her to all my theories, prejudices, and opinions, not just about regenerating pseudoneuronal tissue and my methods for culling it, but the entire scientific research apparatus down belowground, the social dynamics of hab I grew up in, and the philosophical underpinnings of the research exploration proposal we used to float our first forays out here.\nThank goodness Ricci was wearing a mask. She was probably yawning so wide I could have checked her tonsils.\nHere. I handed her the control box. You drive the rest of the way.\nWe were aiming for the equator, where the strong, steady winds have carved a smooth canyon bisecting the ice right down to the planet\u2019s iron core. When we need to travel a long distance, riding that wind is the fastest route.\nRicci clicked a directional adjustment, and our heading swung a few degrees back toward the equator.\nWhat does the whale perceive when we do this? Ricci waggled the thumb of her glove above the joystick. When it changes direction, are we luring it or scaring it away?\nServed me right for telling her not to ask simple questions.\nI don\u2019t really know, I admitted.\nMaybe it makes them think other whales are around. What if they want to be together, just like people, but before now they didn\u2019t know how. Maybe you\u2019ve been teaching them.\nMy eyebrows climbed. I\u2019d never considered how we might be influencing whale behavior, aside from the changes we make for our own benefit.\nThat\u2019s an interesting theory, Ricci. Definitely worth looking into.\nWouldn\u2019t it be terrible to be always alone?\nI\u2019d always considered myself a loner. But in that moment, I honestly couldn\u2019t remember why.\nOnce we\u2019re in the equatorial stream, we ride the wind until we get into the right general area. Then we wipe off the appetite suppressant, and hunger sends us straight into the arms of the nearest electrical storm.\nThe urge to feed is a powerful motivator for most organisms. Mama chases all the algae she can find, and gobbles it double-time. For us on the inside, it\u2019s like an old-style history doc. Everyone stays strapped in their hammocks and rides out the weather as we pitch around on the high seas.\nI always enjoy the feeding frenzy; it gets the blood flowing.\nI\u2019d just settled to enjoy the wild ride when Ricci pinged me.\nTwo crews tried surgical interventions on the regenerated tissue. Let me know what you think, okay? Maybe now we can convince them to let you help.\nThe message was accompanied by bookmarks to live feeds from the supply ships.The first feed showed a whale wedging itself backward into a crevasse, its petals waving back and forth as it wiggled deeper into the canyon-like crack in the ice.\nThe other feed showed a whale scraping its main valve along a serrated ridge of ice. Its oval body stretched and flexed, its bladders bulged. Its petals curled inward then snapped into rigid extension as the force of its body crashed down on the ice\u2019s knife edge.\nInside both whales, tiny specks bounced through the sinuses. I could only imagine what the crew was doing\u2014what I would do in that situation. If they wanted to live, they had to leave. Fast.\nA chill slipped under my skin. My fault. If those whales died, if those crews died, I was to blame. Me alone. Not the two crews. They were obviously desperate enough to try anything. I should have contacted them myself, and offered whatever false apologies would get them to accept my help.\nBut chances are it wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome, except they would have had me to blame. Another entry in my list of crimes.\nFrost spread across my flesh and raised goosebumps. I tugged on my hammock\u2019s buckles to make sure they were secure against the constant pitching and heaving, dialed up the temperature, and snuggled deeper into my quilt. I fired up my simulation model and wandered through towering mountains of pseudoneural tissue, pondering the problem, delving deeper and deeper through chains of crystallized tissue until they danced behind my eyelids. Swirling, stacking, combining, and recombining . . .\nI was nearly asleep when I heard Ricci\u2019s voice.\n\u201cHey, Doc, can we talk?\u201d\nI thought I was dreaming. But no, she was right outside my hammock, gripping the tethers and getting knocked off her feet with every jolt and flex. Her goggled and masked face was lit by a mad flurry of light from the bolts coruscating in every direction just beyond the skin.\n\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d I yanked open the hammock seal. \u201cGet in here.\u201d\nShe plunged through the electrostatic barrier and rolled to the far side of my bed. When she came up, her hair stood on end with static electricity.\n\u201cWhoa.\u201d She swiped off her goggles and breather, stuffed them in one of the hammock pouches, then flattened the dark nimbus of her hair with her palms and grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s wild out there.\u201d\nI pulled my quilt up to my chin and scowled. \u201cThat was stupid.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know but you didn\u2019t ping me back. This is an important situation, right? Life or death.\u201d\nI sighed. \u201cIf you want to rescue people, there are vocations for that.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we have a duty to help people when we can?\u201d\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t want to be helped. They just want to be left alone.\u201d\n\u201cLike you?\u201d\n\u201cNothing you\u2019re doing is helping me, Ricci.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, okay. But if we can figure out a way to help, that\u2019s good too. Better than good. Everyone wins.\u201d\nLying there in my hammock, facing Ricci sprawled at the opposite end and taking up more than half of the space, I finally figured out what kind of person she was.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a meddler, Ricci. A busybody. You were wasted in the sciences. You should have studied social dynamics and targeted a career in one-on-one social work.\u201d\nShe laughed.\n\u201cListen.\u201d I held out my hand, palm up. She took it right away, didn\u2019t hesitate. Her hand was warm. Almost feverish. \u201cIf you want to stay in the crew, you have to relax. Okay? We can\u2019t have emergencies every week. None of us are here for that.\u201d\nShe squeezed my hand and nodded.\n\u201cA little excitement is fine, once in a while,\u201d I continued. \u201cObviously this is an extraordinary situation. But if you keep looking for adventure, we\u2019ll shunt you back to Jane without a second thought.\u201d\nShe twisted the grip into a handshake and gave me two formal pumps. Then she reached for the hammock seal. She would have climbed out into the maelstrom if I hadn\u2019t stopped her.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do that,\u201d I yelled. \u201cNo wandering around when we\u2019re in a feeding frenzy. You\u2019ll get killed. Kill us too, if you go through the wrong bladder wall.\u201d\nShe smiled then, like she didn\u2019t believe me, like it was just some excuse to keep her in my hammock. And when she settled back down, it wasn\u2019t at the opposite end. She snuggled in right beside me, companionable as anything, or even more.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you get lonely, Doc?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d I admitted. \u201cNot much.\u201d\nOur hammocks are roomy, but Ricci didn\u2019t give me much space, and though the tethers absorb movement, we were still jostling against each other.\n\u201cBecause you don\u2019t need anybody or anything.\u201d Her voice in my ear, soft as a caress.\n\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, eventually, you\u2019ll change your mind about that.\u201d\nWhat happened next wasn\u2019t my idea. I was long out of practice, but Ricci had my full and enthusiastic cooperation.\nDown belowground, I was a surgeon, and a good one. My specialty was splicing neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. My skills were in high demand. So high, in fact, that I had a massive support team.\nI\u2019m not talking about a part-time admin or social facilitator. Anyone can have those. I had an entire cadre of people fully dedicated to making sure that if I spent most of my time working and sleeping, what little time remained would be optimized to support physical, emotional, and intellectual health. All my needs were plotted and graphed. People had meetings to argue, for example, over what type of sex best maintained my healthiest emotional state, and once that was decided, they\u2019d argue over the best way to offer that opportunity to me.\nThat\u2019s just an example. I\u2019m only guessing. They kept the administrative muddle under veil. Day-to-day, I only had contact with a few of my staff, and usually I was too busy with my own work to think about theirs. But for a lot of people, I was a billable-hours bonanza.\nBut despite all their hard work, despite the hedonics modeling, best-practice scenarios, and time-tested decision trees, I burned out.\nIt wasn\u2019t their fault. It was mine. I was, and remain, only human.\nI could have just reduced my surgery time. I could have switched to teaching or coaching other surgeons. But no. Some people approach life like it\u2019s an all-or-nothing game. That\u2019s me. I couldn\u2019t be all, so I decided to become nothing.\nUntil Ricci came along, that is.\nWhen the storm ended, the two of us had to face a gauntlet of salacious grins and saucy comments. I didn\u2019t blush, or at least not much. Ricci had put the spark of life in a part of me that had been dark for far too long. I was proud to have her in my crew, in my hammock, in my life.\nThe whole hab gave us a hard time. The joke that gave them the biggest fits, and made even Vula cling helplessly to the rumpus room netting as she convulsed with laughter, involved the two of us calling for evac and setting up a cr\u00e8che in the most socially conservative hab down belowground. Something about imagining us in swathed in religious habits and swarming with crechies tweaked everyone\u2019s funny bones.\nRicci weathered the ridicule better than me. I left to fill the water kegs, and by the time I returned, the hilarity had worn itself out.\nThe eight of us lounged in the rumpus room, the netting gently swaying to and fro as we drifted in the bright directional light of the aquapause. Water spilled off the skin and threw dappled shadows across the room. Vula had launched the media drones and we\u2019d all settled down to watch the feeds.\nMore than once I caught myself brainlessly staring at Ricci, but I kept my goggles on so nobody noticed. I hope.\nTwo hundred kilometers to the northwest and far below us, the seventeen remaining whales congregated in the swirling winds above a dome-shaped mesa that calved monstrous sheets of ice down its massive flanks. A dark electrical storm massed on the horizon, with all its promise of rich concentrations of algae, but the whales didn\u2019t move toward it, just kept circulating and converging, plucking at each other\u2019s skin.\nThree hundred kilometers west lay the abandoned corpses of two whales, their deflated bladders draped over warped sinus skeletons half-buried in slush.\nOur media drones got there too late to trap the whales\u2019 death throes, and I was glad. But Vula and Bouche trapped great visuals of the rescue, showing the valiant supply ship crews swooping in to pluck brightly colored body bags out of the air. Maybe the crews put a little more of a spin on their maneuvering than they needed to, but who could blame them? They rarely got a job worth bragging about.\nOne of Bouche\u2019s media broker friends put the rescue feeds out to market. They started getting good play right away. Bouche fired the media licensing statement into the middle of the room. The numbers glowed green and flickered as they climbed.\n\u201cLook at these fees,\u201d she said. \u201cThis will underwrite our power consumption for a couple years.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Bouchie,\u201d I murmured, and flicked the statement out of my visual field.\nNight was coming, and it presented a hard deadline. If the whales didn\u2019t move before dark, they\u2019d all die.\nRicci moved closer to me in the netting and rested her cheek on my shoulder. I turned my head and touched my lips to her temple, just for a moment. I was deep in my brain simulation, working on the problem. But I kept an eye on the feeds. When the whales collided, I held my breath. As the bladders stretched and budged, I cringed, certain they\u2019d reach their elastic limit and we would see a whale pop, its massive sinuses rupture, its skin tear away and its body plunge to splatter on the icy surface below. But they didn\u2019t. They bounced off each other in slow motion and resumed their aimless circulation.\nHours passed. Eddy got up, extruded a meal, and passed the containers around the netting. Chara and Treasure slipped out of the room. Vula was only half-present\u2014she was working in her studio, sculpting maquettes of popped bladders and painfully twisted corpses.\nEddy yawned. \u201cHow long can these whales live without feeding?\u201d\nI forced a stream of breath through my lips, fluttering the fringe of my bangs. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Indefinitely, maybe, if the crews can figure out a way to provide nutrition internally.\u201d\n\u201cIf they keep their whales fed, maybe they\u2019ll just keep stumbling around, crashing into each other.\u201d Vula\u2019s voice was slurred, her eyes unfocused as she juggled multiple streams.\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried about nightfall, actually,\u201d I said.\nEver since we\u2019d dragged ourselves out of my hammock, Ricci had been trying to pry information from emergency response up the beanstalk, from the supply ship crews who were circling the site, and from the whale crews. They were getting increasingly frantic as time clicked by, and keeping us informed wasn\u2019t high on their list of priorities.\nI rested my palm on the inside of Ricci\u2019s knee. \u201cAre the other crews talking to you yet?\u201d\nShe sat up straight and gave me a pained smile. \u201cA little. I wasn\u2019t getting anywhere, but Jane\u2019s been giving me some tips.\u201d\nThat woke everyone up. Even Vula snapped right out of her creative fugue.\n\u201cIs Jane helping us?\u201d Chara asked, and when Ricci nodded she demanded, \u201cWhy are you keeping her to yourself?\u201d\nRicci shrugged. \u201cJane doesn\u2019t know anything about whales.\u201d\n\u201cIf she\u2019s been helping you maybe she can help us too,\u201d said Eddy.\n\u201cYeah, come on Ricci, stop hogging Jane.\u201d Bouche raked her fingers through her hair, sculpting it into artful tufts. \u201cI want to know what she thinks of all this.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Ricci said. \u201cI\u2019ll ask her.\u201d\nA few moments later she fired Jane\u2019s feed into the room and adjusted the perspective so her friend seemed to be sitting in the middle of the room. She wore a baggy black tunic and trousers, and her hair was gathered into a ponytail that draped over the back of her chair. The pinnas of her ears were perforated in a delicate lace pattern.\nTreasure and Chara came barreling down the access sinus and plunged through the hatch. They hopped over to their usual spot in the netting and settled in. Jane waved at them.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making you an honorary crew member,\u201d Eddy told Jane. \u201cRicci has to share you with us. We all get equal Jane time.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to that,\u201d said Ricci.\n\u201cFight over me later, when everyone\u2019s safe.\u201d Jane said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the other crews are delaying evacuation. Who would risk dying when they can just leave?\u201d\nEveryone laughed.\n\u201cThis cadre self-selects for extremists.\u201d Eddy rotated her finger over her head, encompassing all of us in the gesture. \u201cPeople like us would rather die than back down.\u201d\n\u201cI guess you\u2019re not alone in that,\u201d said Jane. \u201cEvery hab has plenty of stubborn people.\u201d\n\u201cBut unlike them, we built everything we have,\u201d I said. \u201cThat makes it much harder to give up.\u201d\n\u201cLooks like someone finally made a decision, though.\u201d Ricci maximized the main feed. Jane wheeled around to join us at the netting.\nGlowing dots tracked tiny specks across the wide mesa, pursued by flashing trails of locational data. Vula\u2019s media drones zoomed in, showing a succession of brightly colored, hard-shell body bags shunting though the main valves. Sleet built up along their edges, quickly hardening to a solid coating of ice.\n\u201cQuitters,\u201d Treasure murmured under her breath.\nJane looked shocked.\n\u201cIf you think you know what you\u2019d do in their place, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody knows.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d stay,\u201d Treasure said. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave Mama.\u201d\nChara grinned. \u201cMe too. We\u2019ll die together if we had to.\u201d\nBouche pointed at the two of them. \u201cIf we ever have to evac, you two are going last.\u201d\nJane\u2019s expression of shock widened, then she gathered herself into a detached and professional calm.\nRicci squeezed my hand. \u201cThe supply ships want to shuttle some of the evacuees to us instead of taking them all the way to the beanstalk. How many can we carry?\u201d\nI checked the mass budget and made a few quick calculations. \u201cAbout twenty. More if we dump mass.\u201d I raised my voice. \u201cLet\u2019s pitch and ditch everything we can. If it\u2019s not enough we can think about culling a little water and feedstock. Is everyone okay with that?\u201d\nTo my surprise, nobody argued. I\u2019d rarely seen the crew move so fast, but with Jane around everyone wanted to look like a hero.\nLife has rarely felt as sunny as it did that day.\nWatching the others abandon their whales was deeply satisfying. It\u2019s not often in life you can count your victories, but each of those candy-colored, human-sized pods was a score for me and a big, glaring zero for my old, unlamented colleagues. I\u2019d outlasted them.\nNot only that, but I had a new lover, a mostly-harmonious crew of friends, and the freedom to go anywhere and do anything I liked, as long as it could be done from within the creature I called home.\nBut mostly, I loved having an important job to do.\nI checked our location to make sure we were far enough away that if the other whales began to drift, they wouldn\u2019t wander into the debris stream. Then we paired into work teams, pulled redundant equipment, ferried it to the main valve, and jettisoned it.\nI kept a tight eye on the mass budget, watched for tissue stress around the valve, and made strict calls on what to chuck and what to keep.\nHygiene and maintenance bots were sacrosanct. Toilets and hygiene stations, too. Safety equipment, netting, hammocks\u2014all essential. But each of us had fifty kilos of personal effects. I ditched mine first. Clothes, jewelry, mementos, a few pieces of art\u2014some of it real artisan work but not worth a human life. Vula tossed a dozen little sculptures, all gifts from friends and admirers. Eddy was glad to have an excuse to throw out the guitar she\u2019d never learned to play. Treasure had a box of ancient hand-painted dinnerware inherited from her cr\u00e8che; absolutely irreplaceable, but they went too. Chara threw out her devotional shrine. It was gold and took up most of her mass allowance, but we could fab another.\nWe even tossed the orang bot. We all liked the furry thing, but it was heavy. Bouche stripped out its proprietary motor modules and tossed the shell. We\u2019d fab another, eventually.\nIf we\u2019d had time for second thoughts, maybe the decisions would have been more difficult. Or maybe not. People were watching, and we knew it. Having an audience helped us cooperate.\nIt wasn\u2019t just Jane we were trying to impress. Bouche\u2019s media output was gathering a lot of followers. We weren\u2019t just trapping the drama anymore, we were part of the story.\nBouche monitored our followship, both the raw access stats and the digested analysis from the PR firm she\u2019d engaged to boost the feed\u2019s profile. When the first supply ship backed up to our valve and we began pulling body bags inside, Bouche whooped. Our numbers had just gone atmospheric.\nWe were a clown show, though. Eight of us crowded in the isthmus sinus, shuttling body bags, everyone bouncing around madly and getting in each other\u2019s way. Jane helped sort us out by monitoring the overhead cameras and doing crowd control. Me, I tried not to be an obstruction while making load-balancing decisions. Though we\u2019d never taken on so much weight at once, I didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. But I only looked at strict mathematical tolerances. I\u2019m not an engineer; I didn\u2019t consider the knock-on effects of the sudden mass shift.\nIn the end, we took on thirty-eight body bags. We were still distributing them throughout the sinuses when Ricci reported the rescue was over.\nThat\u2019s it. The cargo ships have forty-five body bags. They\u2019re making the run to the beanstalk now.\nIs that all? If the ships are full, we could prune some feedstock.\nEveryone else is staying. They\u2019re still betting their whales will move.\nWhen the last body bag was secured so it wouldn\u2019t pitch through a bladder, I might have noticed we were drifting toward the mesa. But I was too busy making sure the new cargo was secure and accounted for.\nI pinged each unit, loaded their signatures into the maintenance dashboard, mapped their locations, checked the data in the mass budget, created a new dashboard for monitoring the new cargo\u2019s power consumption, consumables, and useful life. Finally, I cross-checked our manifest against the records the supply ships had given us.\nThat was when I realized we were carrying two members of my original crew.\nWhen Ricci found me, I was pacing the dorsal sinus, up and down, arguing with myself. Mostly silently.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re having some kind of emotional crisis, I\u2019m sure Jane would love to help,\u201d she said.\nI spun on my heel and stomped away, bouncing off the walls.\nShe yelled after me. \u201cNot me though. I don\u2019t actually care about your emotional problems.\u201d\nI bounced off a wall once more and stopped, both hands gripping its clear ridged surface.\n\u201cNo?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you care?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m too self-involved.\u201d\nI laughed. Ricci reached out and ruffled her fingers through the short hair on the back of my neck. Her touch sent an electric jolt through my nerves.\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why we get along so well,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot alike.\u201d\nKissing while wearing goggles and a breather is awkward and unsatisfying. I pulled her close and pressed my palms to the soft pad of flesh at the base of her spine. I held her until she got restless, then she took my hand and led me to the rumpus room.\nBouche lounged in the netting, eyes closed.\n\u201cBouchie is giving a media interview,\u201d Ricci whispered. \u201cAn agent is booking her appearances and negotiating fees. If we get enough, we can upgrade the extruder and subscribe to a new recipe bank.\u201d\nI pulled a bulb out of the extruder. \u201cShe\u2019ll be hero of the hab.\u201d\n\u201cYou could wake them up, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWake up who?\u201d I asked, and took a deep swig of sweet caffeine.\n\u201cYour old buddies. In the body bags. Wake them up. Have it out.\u201d\nI managed to swallow without choking. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll apologize.\u201d\nI laughed, a little too hard, a little too long, and only stopped when Ricci began to look offended.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wake them,\u201d I said. \u201cWhere would they sleep until we got to the beanstalk?\u201d\n\u201cThey can have my hammock.\u201d She sidled close. \u201cI\u2019ll bunk with you.\u201d\nWe kissed then, and properly. Thoroughly. Until I met Ricci, I\u2019d been a shrunken bladder; nobody knew my possible dimensions. Ricci filled me up. I expanded, large enough to contain whole universes.\n\u201cNo. They\u2019re old news.\u201d I kissed her again and ran my finger along the edge of her jaw. \u201cIt was another life. They don\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d\nStrange thing was, saying those words made it true. All I cared about was Ricci, and all I could see was the glowing possibility of a future together, rising over a broad horizon.\nTwilight began to move over us. We only had a little time to spare before we recalled the media drones, wiped off the appetite suppressant, and left the other crews to freeze in the dark.\nWe gathered in the rumpus room, all watching the same feed. Whales circulated above the mesa. Slanting sunlight cast deep orange reflections across their skins, their windward surfaces creamy with blowing snow. Inside, dark spots bounced around the sinuses. If I held my breath, I could almost hear their words, follow their arguments. When I bit my lip, I tasted their tears.\n\u201cMore than a hundred people,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand why they\u2019d decide to commit suicide. A few maybe, but not so many.\u201d\n\u201cSome will evac before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Vula shrugged. \u201cAnd as for the rest, it\u2019s their own decision. I can\u2019t say I would do anything different. And I hope I never find out.\u201d\nI shivered. \u201cAgreed.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Jane said. \u201cSomeone must be exercising duress.\u201d\n\u201cNobody forces anyone to do anything out here, any more than they do down belowground,\u201d said Treasure.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Chara. \u201cWe\u2019re not crechies, Jane. We do what we want.\u201d\nJane sputtered, trying to apologize.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Eddy told her. \u201cWe\u2019re all upset. None of us really understand.\u201d\n\u201cThe whales still might move,\u201d said Bouche. \u201cThey can spend a little time in the dark, right Doc?\u201d\nI set a timer with a generous margin for error and fired it into the middle of the room. \u201cEight minutes, then we have to leave. The other whales will have a little more than thirty minutes before they freeze at full dark. Then their bladders burst.\u201d\nChara and Treasure pulled themselves out of the netting.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not watching this,\u201d Chara said. \u201cIf you want to hang overhead and root for them to evac, go ahead.\u201d\nWe all waved goodnight. The two of them stumped away to their hammock, and silence settled over the rumpus room. Just the whoosh and murmur of the bladders, and the faint skiff of wind over the skin. A few early stars winked through the clouds. They seemed compassionate, somehow. Understanding. Looking at those bright pinpoints, I understood how on ancient Earth, people might use the stars to conjure gods.\nI put my arm around Ricci\u2019s shoulders and drew her close. She let me hold her for two minutes, no more, and then she pulled away.\n\u201cI can\u2019t watch this either,\u201d she said. \u201cI have to do something.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d I drew her hand back just for a moment and planted a kiss on the palm. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d\nVula nodded, and Jane, too. Eddy and Bouche both got up and hugged her. Eleanora kept her head down, hiding her tears. The electrostatic membrane crackled as Ricci left.\n\u201cDo you know some of the people down there, Doc?\u201d asked Jane.\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d I said. \u201cNot for a long time.\u201d\nWe fell quiet again, watching the numbers on the countdown. Ricci had left her shadow beside me. I felt her cold absence; something missing that should be whole. I could have spied on her, see where she\u2019d gone, but no. She deserved her privacy.\nThe first little quake shuddering through the sinuses told me exactly where she was.\nI checked our location, blinked, and then checked it again. We were right over the mesa, above the other whales, all seventeen of them. Wind, bad luck, or instinct had had brought us there\u2014but did it matter? Ricci\u2014her location mattered. She was in the caudal stump, with the waste pellets, and the secondary valve.\nNo. Ricci, no. I slapped my breather on and launched myself out of the rumpus room, running aft as fast as I could. Don\u2019t do that. Stop.\nI lost my footing and bounced hard. You might hit them. You might . . .\nKill them.\nWhen I got to the caudal stump, Ricci was just clicking the last pellet through the valve. If we\u2019d dumped them during the pitch and ditch, none of it would have happened. But dry waste is light. We\u2019d accumulated ten pellets, only five kilograms, so I hadn\u2019t bothered with them.\nBut a half-kilo pellet falling from a height can do a lot of damage.\nI fired the feed into the middle of the sinus. One whale was thrashing on the slushy mesa surface, half-obscured by the concussive debris. Two more were falling, twisting in agony, their bladders tattered and flapping. Another three would have escaped damage, but they circulated into the path of the oncoming pellets, each one burst in turn, as if a giant hand had reached down and squeezed the life out of them.\nRicci was in my arms, then. Both of us quaking, falling to our knees. Holding each other and squeezing hard, as if we could break each other\u2019s bones with the force of our own mistakes.\nSix whales. Twenty-two people. All dead.\nThe other eleven whales scattered. One fled east and plunged through the twilight band into night. Its skin and bladders froze and burst, and its sinus skeleton shattered on the jagged ice. Its crew had been one of the most stubborn\u2014none had evacuated. They all died. Ten people.\nIn total, thirty-two died because Ricci made an unwise decision.\nThe remaining ten whales re-congregated over a slushy depression near the beanstalk. Ricci had bought the surviving crews a few more hours, so they tried a solution along the lines Ricci had discovered. Ice climbers use drones with controlled explosive capabilities to stabilize their climbing routes. They tried a test; it worked\u2014the whales fled again, but in the wrong direction and re-congregated close to the leading edge of night.\nIn the end, the others evacuated. All seventy got in their body bags and called for evac.\nBy strict accounting, Ricci\u2019s actions led to a positive outcome. I remind her of that whenever I can. She says it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014we don\u2019t play math games with human lives. Dead is dead, and nothing will change that.\nAnd she\u2019s right, because the moment she dumped those pellets, Ricci became the most notorious murderer our planet has ever known.\nThe other habs insist we hand her over to a conflict resolution panel. They\u2019ve sent negotiators, diplomats\u2014they\u2019ve even sent Jane\u2014but we won\u2019t give her up. To them, that proves we\u2019re dangerous. Criminals. Outlaws.\nBut we live in the heart of the matter, and we see it a little differently.\nRicci did nothing wrong. It was a desperate situation and she made a desperate call. Any one of us might have done the same thing, if we\u2019d been smart enough to think of it.\nWe\u2019re a solid band of outlaws, now. Vula, Treasure, Chara, Eddy, Bouche, Eleanora, Ricci, and me. We refuse to play nice with the other habs. They could cut off our feedstock, power, and data, but we\u2019re betting they won\u2019t. If they did, our blood would be on their hands.\nSo none of us are going anywhere. Why would we leave? The whole planet is ours, with unlimited horizons.\nKelly Robson's short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Tor.com, Asimov's Science Fiction, and multiple year's best anthologies.

She thought in that first wakening haze that it might be a scent, like the \u201cbad air\u201d her mother had talked about, creeping in to announce their presence. Then full wakefulness and knowledge struck her, and her only thought was Not yet.\n Laura rolled out of bed, making sure not to disturb Jenny, who\u2019d crawled in about an hour after bedtime. Toby, in the crib, slept like a swaddled stone. The nightlight cast a weak gold glow over them, but the first hints of blue had begun to creep in, cool and unfriendly. She glanced back once at the sound of Jenny\u2019s whimper, then turned her back on her sleeping children.\n At least their father wasn\u2019t here.\n It was an old bargain, old as the Hollow at least. With bargains you had to uphold your side; she\u2019d learned that early, probably before she even knew about the Gentlemen.\n Her bedroom in her parents\u2019 house had faced the street, and when she was five the changing shapes of headlights across the far wall had fascinated her. One night she woke to see a block of light against the far wall, flickering in all the colors of frost. When the light stayed put, as if the car that cast it had parked outside, she sat up in bed, then turned to the window.\n The light was just outside, on the strip of green that her father liked to call the lawn. She crawled out of bed, dropping the last couple of inches to the floor, and reached for the curtain.\n \u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d\n Laura turned to see her mother standing in the doorway. \u201cMumma?\u201d\n Her mother crossed the room in two strides and took Laura into her arms, cradling her head against her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t look, baby, don\u2019t look.\u201d\n Obediently, Laura laid her head against her mother\u2019s shoulder and listened as something huge or a hundred smaller somethings passed by with a thunderous shussh. Her mother\u2019s eyes were closed tight, and she rocked Laura as if she were an infant again, even though Laura had two little brothers and hadn\u2019t been rocked since the first one was born. The sleeve of her mother\u2019s bathrobe was damp with a thousand tiny droplets.\n In the morning, she tried to talk about it. \u201cI had a dream last night\u2014\u201d she said at the breakfast table.\n \u201cI expect we all had dreams,\u201d her mother said, pouring milk over her Cheerios. \u201cWhat with all that pizza last night. Bet you had them worst of all, right, Kyle?\u201d\n Her brother Kyle, six years old and indeed the one who\u2019d eaten the most, shook his head and began to cough.\n The light was stronger in the living room. Soon it would be strong enough for her to read by, if she\u2019d ever had the urge to do so. Laura closed the bedroom door behind her, making sure it latched, and picked her way through the maze of toys that covered the carpet. She watched the blue-edged shadows rise over the edge of the couch and drew a deep breath. I wonder what they\u2019ll bring, she made herself think over the rising dread in the back of her mind. And to whom they\u2019ll bring it.\n They bring gifts. I have to remember that. They bring gifts too.\n It wasn\u2019t till she reached second grade, just after Kyle\u2019s funeral, that she found a name for them. It was in a book of children\u2019s poems, the old kind that usually read as if they\u2019d been dipped in Karo syrup. But this one, \u201cThe Smuggler\u2019s Song,\u201d wasn\u2019t like that at all. It made the room seem darker when she read it, and darker still when she thought about it. Even after she learned that the poet hadn\u2019t ever set foot in Brooks\u2019 Hollow, she still secretly called them the Gentlemen, after the poem.\n Five and twenty ponies/ trotting through the dark . . .\n She waited until her father took her remaining brother out to play baseball before talking to her mother about it. \u201cMumma,\u201d she asked as they washed dishes together, \u201cwhy did Kyle get sick?\u201d\n Her mother\u2019s hands paused, wrist-deep in sudsy water. \u201cWell,\u201d she said after a moment, in that careful voice adults used when they didn\u2019t know how to say something, \u201cpeople in the Hollow get sick sometimes. It\u2019s just something in the air.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, sweetie. I won\u2019t let anything\u2014\u201d She stopped, her lips pressed together, and went on in a different tone. \u201cYou know what the pioneers used to say about our land? Good land, bad air. They might have been right about the air, but we had the best farms for miles. Still do. The Hollow\u2019s a good place, Laura. I want you to remember that.\u201d\n Later that evening, after the boys had settled in to watch football, her mother took her by the hand and led her upstairs, where she rummaged in the back of the closet until she found an old cardboard box. \u201cI thought you might want to try this on,\u201d she said, and took out a fragile crown, woven out of hair-thin wire and stones like gleaming ice, so delicate it chimed in her hands. She set it on Laura\u2019s head and held up a mirror. \u201cDon\u2019t you look just like a princess, now.\u201d\n Laura caught her breath. \u201cI do! Mumma, I do!\u201d\n \u201cI thought you might.\u201d Her mother smiled.\n Laura shivered to remember that crown. It was here somewhere, in the boxes she\u2019d packed up after her mother\u2019s death, but she hadn\u2019t ever gone looking for it. She sometimes dreamed of wearing it, and woke up with bile in her throat.\n She reached up and took down the little blue notebook from its place above the television. It had pages of notes about the sound the Gentlemen made: pines in the wind, highway traffic very far away, heavy rain, but none of them quite caught it. She\u2019d been keeping the notes ever since she could write, first on what it looked like when the Gentlemen went by, then\u2014later, as she grew up and began to understand\u2014the annotations.\n And the more she watched the indistinct shapes through the curtain, the more she felt as if her whole life became only watching. Her second brother\u2019s death, her graduation, the strikes at the cabinet factory\u2014all images apart from her. Even now, she was at a distance, watching herself sitting huddled wrong-way-round on the couch, a patch of drying formula stiff and sticky under her left forearm.\n Sometimes they brought things, she told herself again. A crown, a song, a whisper in someone\u2019s ear. And their trail was thick with flowers, even when they passed by late in October.\n And the Hollow was a friendly place, after all. It seemed there was always a family to bring a casserole; it seemed there was always a service \u201cfor those taken from us\u201d at the little church that was the only official marker of Brooks\u2019 Hollow, and the pews were always full.\n But you didn\u2019t talk about it. You shrugged, and blamed bad air, and made sure your child\u2019s last months were comfortable, treating them like a stranger the whole time, and then you buried them in the good rich earth of the Hollow.\n The light grew, shimmering like opals, and with it came a faint scent: greenery, growing things. But there was an edge to it as well, something like grass clippings left in the rain and then rotting in the sun. Something green gone wrong. Laura held the book tight against her chest, as if it might hide her, her and her children. \u201cThe Smuggler\u2019s Song\u201d was inked in blue on the inside flap, an addition she\u2019d made just after her wedding.\n Them that asks no questions isn\u2019t told a lie./ Watch the wall, my darling, when the Gentlemen go by!\n In her senior year at the county high she met Rich. Rich came from the north of the county, and he played guitar, and when he smiled at her Laura felt her heart come unstuck. For the first time in ages she felt as if she could be part of the world again.\n She was worried at first what her parents would say. Some of her girlfriends had had to move out of the Hollow because their parents had kicked them out for any number of reasons\u2014going out with boys, going out with only one boy, getting pregnant, not staying pregnant. Her parents turned out to like Rich, though, and they even helped them find a place to live.\n They got married on the hottest day of the year. But the sky was clear, the beer was cold, and Rich looked at her like she was the sun come to earth. At the reception, she tore her hem dancing and had to go looking for her mother. She finally thought to look for her in the bathroom, only to find her talking to an old friend. \u201cRich tells me they\u2019ve bought a trailer down in the Hollow,\u201d said Laura\u2019s old babysitter.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a nice little place,\u201d Laura\u2019s mother said. Laura shrank back against the door.\n \u201cThat ain\u2019t right, Missy. Bringing someone new into the Hollow ain\u2019t right, especially not a good sort like Rich. Why didn\u2019t you send her away?\u201d\n Laura held her breath. \u201cShe\u2019s all I got,\u201d her mother said after a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t send her away.\u201d\n \u201cOh, Missy. That\u2019s no way to treat a good girl. You know what the Hollow\u2019s like\u2014that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been sending our girls out. I know. You get sent or you get taken, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n \u201cOr maybe you spend a good long life in the Hollow, like me and Bobby.\u201d Laura\u2019s mother sniffed. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s what I want for my girl. You think of that? Besides, the way you keep sending your girls out, there won\u2019t be hardly any families left, and it\u2019ll be harder for anyone who stays. You think you\u2019re doing it for the whole Hollow, but it\u2019s just for yourself.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Laura\u2019s babysitter insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s not why. There\u2019s things a girl should know, if she\u2019s going to be a mother in the Hollow. You think she can handle that? I can\u2019t handle that, and I\u2019m twice her age. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n \u201c . . . she\u2019s all I got.\u201d\n The other woman sighed. \u201cWell, God keep you both.\u201d\n Laura hesitated a moment longer, then thumped the door as if she\u2019d just opened it. \u201cMumma?\u201d she called. \u201cI need some help with my dress.\u201d\n \u201cBe there in a moment,\u201d her mother said.\n Not worth it. She formed the words, but couldn\u2019t make herself push the breath behind them. It was easy to forget, sometimes, amid the gifts tangible and intangible. No woman in the Hollow ever miscarried. No plants died in the ground, no house ever caught fire, no one ever quite starved. When you looked at the uncertain world, you could be forgiven for thinking that maybe Kyle\u2019s life had been a good trade.\n At least Laura hoped you could be forgiven.\n What was it the union man had said, just before she\u2019d had to leave for Toby\u2019s birth? \u201cThe contracts need to be renegotiated,\u201d he\u2019d said, and there was more. Most of it she hadn\u2019t paid attention to, being nine months pregnant and having what her friend Charlene called \u201cbaby brain.\u201d She\u2019d thought it was dumb at the time\u2014you make a bargain, you stick with it\u2014but that had been before Rich came back.\n Maybe bargains went bad, sometimes. Maybe they went bad and there wasn\u2019t anything you could do but stick with it and hope for the best.\n The closest anyone ever came to saying anything out loud was just after her mother\u2019s death (no Gentlemen, just three packs of Marlboros every day for twenty years). A lawyer in a rumpled blue suit had arranged for a big town meeting, and he\u2019d gotten nearly the whole Hollow to attend on the promise of free barbecue. He had charts, and maps, and he talked excitedly about disease clusters and the factory up the road. And after half an hour of silence from the good folks of the Hollow, he\u2019d asked them to join in a class action suit.\n The minister of First Church, acting for all of them, had smiled and nodded and escorted him to the door. \u201cA lawsuit can\u2019t help us,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201ceven if you knew who to sue.\u201d\n It was right after he closed the door that someone could have spoken, could have broken that throat-tightening silence and actually said who was to blame. But the lawyer drove off, the silence won out, and the minister shrugged and sighed.\n Rich went to the war. Rich came back. Laura had written him about Toby\u2019s birth, and it made her heart fly free again to see him smile. But the look he turned out the windows was haunted, and with more than just wartime ghosts. He couldn\u2019t drive any more, not without pulling over and putting his head down every few miles. So he spent more time in the Hollow, and the Hollow clotted around him.\n In April, after the Gentlemen\u2019s spring visit (which would later be annotated with Ashley Irvine, 6, 4 mos. after G.), they had a fight. It wasn\u2019t even a real fight; she\u2019d dropped a glass, and he\u2019d charged into the kitchen so fast he almost knocked over Toby. He yelled at her, she yelled back, both scared and angry at each other for being scared, and Laura didn\u2019t even see the slap coming until her cheek was already burning with it. She raised a hand to her face, disbelieving. Rich stared at her as if she\u2019d grown horns, then turned and ran out the door, heedless of Toby\u2019s yowls.\n Laura didn\u2019t go after him, even when dinner and sunset passed without his return. She took extra time putting the kids to bed, and didn\u2019t get up when she heard the front door open.\n When she came out from the bedroom, she found him sitting at the kitchen table, staring at his hands. She sat down across from him, and after a while, he began to talk.\n \u201cThey told me I might have trouble, coming back,\u201d he said, and this time he didn\u2019t move away when Laura took his hands in hers. \u201cAnd I think I was okay, for a little while . . . But something about here, it\u2019s like, like I keep seeing things I oughtn\u2019t, and it just keeps getting worse. Like something keeps poking at my head.\u201d He glanced out the window, as if something was watching him.\n Laura said nothing, only thought of how smart Rich had been in high school, how quickly he saw things that it took her ages to notice, and how she should have known that wouldn\u2019t change.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d he said, and kissed her fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t know where just yet, but we can live with my folks a while.\u201d\n Laura unknotted her hands from his and went to stand by the window. \u201cThis is my home,\u201d she said.\n Rich\u2019s eyes went wide and broken. \u201cI know, babe, but it\u2019s not a good place. We need to get out.\u201d\n I do. But you get sent or you get taken, and that\u2019s it. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201ceither I go with you, or you go alone.\u201d\n \u201cWhat? No, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d She turned and smiled at him, blinking back tears. \u201cI\u2019m sending you away, Rich. I\u2019m sending you out of my life.\u201d And out of the Hollow.\n The divorce wasn\u2019t been pretty\u2014it couldn\u2019t have been, with the two of them still in love. Rich called her and left messages, angry or maudlin or pleading, and she\u2019d listened to them all, hugging herself so tight there would be white marks in her arms when the message ended. Toby began to fuss more, and Jenny started to crawl into bed with her at night.\n But Rich was free. Rich was out of it, and she could never, ever hand him over to them. Even if she sometimes woke and cried over the cold side of the bed. Even if she was back watching her life again.\n The lights hadn\u2019t changed, and the whispering had stilled. And now Laura had to admit it, had to see that the Gentlemen had come to her house. Oh, I tried, I tried, she thought. I could have sent the kids away, I could . . .\n But would it have done anything? The old women, like Lara\u2019s babysitter, had sent their kids away. And some had then died alone and unnoticed, so successful at cutting the ties between their loved ones and the Hollow that they\u2019d cut their own lifelines. Even that wouldn\u2019t have been enough.\n She\u2019d gotten as far as the border of the Hollow, car packed to the gills and kids in the backseat, before the strength left her limbs and she found herself unable to leave. She\u2019d even thought about ringing the house with iron and salt, the way one woman had back in \u201909, but that woman\u2019s family had all died in a gas explosion two months after. The Gentlemen took their claim. You had to carry out a life to them, and you had to let them carry that life away.\n It was an old bargain, old as the Hollow at least. And you had to keep bargains.\n A soft trill shook the window panes, traveling from them down to the tips of her fingers through some malign conduction. Her first instinct was to categorize it, and she thought of flutes, screech owls, mourning doves, before she quite heard it, and hearing it was lost.\n This was right, the cry said. Children die, and if one of them had to, who better to choose than their mother? She sat up\u2014looking, had she known it, very like her mother\u2014then got to her feet.\n She ghosted into the bedroom and gazed at her children. Toby, she thought, he\u2019s too young to really understand about being sick. No, Jenny, because she\u2019s had at least some time. No . . .\n Something burred against her consciousness, a wrong note in the Gentlemen\u2019s music.\n Decide. You have time. Just decide.\n But the burr remained, coming through in bursts like\u2014like a phone, she realized, and glanced over her shoulder in time to see the harsh red light of the answering machine flick on.\n \u201cUh. Hi. It\u2019s me,\u201d Rich\u2019s voice said, crackling over the tape. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re not awake\u2014Jesus, I hope I didn\u2019t wake the kids, I\u2019m sorry\u2014but I had to talk to you.\u201d He went on, but Laura was no longer paying attention. His voice was harsh and ragged and so unlike the Rich she\u2019d known, but it was enough to drown out the Gentlemen\u2019s echoes.\n Laura looked back at her children. She could let herself walk into the room, as she was doing now, let herself pick up a child and go outside. And she could tell herself later, when her child died, that she hadn\u2019t really done it, that she\u2019d just watched herself do it.\n She thought of the crown, and of Kyle.\n Jenny shifted, putting out a hand to the empty space where Laura had slept, and sat up. \u201cMumma?\u201d\n \u201cStay inside, sweetie,\u201d Laura said. She crossed her arms, denying herself a last hug in case her resolve failed. \u201cStay inside and under the covers. I\u2019ll be back\u2014\u201d She caught the lie between her teeth and shook her head. \u201cSleep tight, sweetie. Love you.\u201d\n She turned her back, ignoring Jenny\u2019s scared squeak, and closed the door. The last moments of Rich\u2019s message cut off, cut short by the tape, and Laura touched the answering machine as she passed. \u201cLove you too.\u201d\n Finally she closed her eyes, opened the front door, and stepped out into light. The trill sounded again, closer, all around her, and she opened her eyes with a gasp. Two dozen sets of eyes regarded her, wide and unblinking.\n They didn\u2019t ride horses, of course; at the back of her mind she was proud of herself for having figured that out. They rode owls, giant white faces staring at her without curiosity. That was the only thing recognizable about them; it was as if the owls, strange and gigantic as they were, were a concession to reality.\n They were made of light, and they shone, oh they shone. For a second she thought they could be angels, but the memory of the little blue notebook tainted that thought. One of the riders\u2014white and blue, and human only in shape\u2014leaned over his reins toward her and gestured toward the house.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get Rich. You don\u2019t get them. You get me.\u201d\n The rider slashed one hand across his chest: rejection. Others agreed, some agitating their mounts so that the huge birds hopped from one foot to the other.\n She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you want. You don\u2019t get to choose. And I choose this. I choose me.\u201d She leaned forward, and was rewarded by the sight of the head rider leaning away from her.\n You think you\u2019re doing it for the Hollow, but it\u2019s just for yourself. The words were her mother\u2019s, but the head of one of the Gentlemen moved, as if speaking her thoughts.\n Laura shook her head. \u201cNo. For the Hollow. For the dead of the Hollow.\u201d All the services, all the casseroles, all the dead then and now.\n There came a familiar prickling on the back of her neck. If she turned now, she knew, she\u2019d be able to see Jenny at the window, nose mashed up against the glass, mouth open in the beginning of a sob.\n She didn\u2019t turn, not even to say goodbye. Watch, darling. Watch. \u201cThis bargain is ended,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will not be renegotiating.\u201d\n The head rider motioned to the others, and they advanced on her, cruel hooked beaks clashing. Laura held her ground. It always hurt to break a bargain; there was always something that got lost. But it was worth it, if the contract was no good.\n The owls took her by hand and foot and hair, and their beaks were sharp. The first cut came, and with it a rending deeper than her skin, deeper than her heart: the Hollow breaking, breaking so that it could never be repaired, and her blood turning the rich soil to useless swamp.\n Watch. Oh, watch."}

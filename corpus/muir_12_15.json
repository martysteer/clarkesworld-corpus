Their fingernails are frilled and raised freckles stipple each arm in shades of red and orange. Permit tags list their names: Mary. Moana. Ruth. Myrrh. Huia. Anna. Iridium. Coffee. K\u014dkako.\nThe Franckton crofters stand and watch from behind the barrier. They\u2019ve knocked off midday work to come. You can practically see the pong of hot mulch and melting boot elastomeric coming off them. There\u2019s even a man there from the New Awhitu Listener to take pictures.\nDripping sweat, the Customs detail sign off their quarantine. The wives seem indifferent to the heat. The air from the transport ruffles the thin plaits of their hair, each strand with its own line of fine bulges like a polyp. Everyone is close enough to see.\n\u201cIf the Listener links any of those photos,\u201d Simeon\u2019s telling the photographer, \u201cyou\u2019re dog tucker, mate.\u201d Simeon\u2019s got the gist of it already. The man knows Simeon\u2019s reputation and is timidly pressing Delete.\nThe Mayor signs the receipt of goods slowly. She\u2019s asking questions, gesturing at the wives, but she\u2019s not getting answers, just filework and shrugging. The Ministry men take the tablet with the signature and you can tell they just want to get the hell out of there before something happens.\nLater on when the croft pores over the paperwork, they discover the wives are lichen splices. No one\u2019s ever heard of it.\nWhen the news had broken that the Ministry was awarding them wives, the relief was so great in Franckton that it was more pain than pleasure. They\u2019d spent the last fifty years incubating on Governmental loan and mortgaging over half the harvest each time. A lot of beers got sunk during all the frantic budgeting that came subsequently. The staunchest Union crofters forgot to do anything but tab up how many generations it would take before all they\u2019d be paying for was the foetal scan.\nOnly Simeon was hostile; nobody was surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d he kept on saying. \u201cIt\u2019s a nothing. We\u2019re getting gypped. We\u2019re the highest-revenue croft and they\u2019re shutting us up, they\u2019re paying us off, the next time we don\u2019t say how high when they say jump we\u2019ll get our subsidy slashed and you bastards are falling over yourselves to lick their arse . . . \u201d\nHe got told off by the Mayor for whinging. The sentiment was that there were only twenty wives to go round and he\u2019d been assigned one and heaps of crofters hadn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t as though they were all going to receive rose-splice wives and free beer and skittles. Of course it was a sop. It was a harvest cycle, and the Ministry wanted to keep them sweet so that there wouldn\u2019t be a tanty chucked over the price of wheat or onions or oats come the buying time. All of Franckton was going into this with their eyes open; they weren\u2019t naive . . . But they still planned a picnic and a p\u014dhiri and someone agreed to sing for the welcome and everyone getting a wife washed their shirt.\nWhen the wives finally landed and they got their first eyeful, they knew there wasn\u2019t going to be a picnic or a p\u014dhiri. They took up their tines and trudged back to the bunds without preamble. Only Simeon, by way of expressing his feelings, threw a big handful of grit at one of the whirring transports. It exploded into a cloud of dusty shrapnel. Some of the crofters cringed, but nothing happened.\nThe lichen-splice wives are pale and dry. Nobody really knows what to do with them. The last batch of kids had been nine years ago, with a bunch of hardy poppy wives and their minders. They were all hard cases and laughed and made jokes during the incubation, like poppy-wives should. The Mayor was getting treated for germline trouble with her chromosomes 5 and 10, so the Ministry had made them pay through the nose for gene insurance and they\u2019d all been sore about it, but not too sore because it was the Mayor and the croft begrudged her nothing. Simeon had squabbled and said there should be a lawsuit. Some of the crofters agreed, but then there were children to take care of and nobody did anything.\nThe first thing the crofters hate is the names. Their wives have been given croft names, and that\u2019s insult to injury, somehow. It\u2019s ingratiating. They should have had city names and all been Florence or Hannah or Candy. So they all become \u201cwife\u201d by common fiat.\nThey seem obliging enough, but they never speak, except sometimes \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d They move slowly in the Franckton heat, but unmindingly. They are slow in general to walk or to carry. They lid their eyes heavily when they talk and keep their mouths a little open, sometimes flickering their tongues.\nSimeon holds forth in the pub almost every night about them. Most of the croft complaints are about how their wife stares or can\u2019t cook the tea right or is stupid, or off-putting, or intractable, but Simeon goes further than that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to incubate with some knock-off government sack,\u201d he says of his wife. \u201cShe looks like a spastic. She looks like a trisomy hutch.\u201d\nSome of the croft look away but they don\u2019t protest, because you don\u2019t with Simeon, it\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Simeon says, \u201cI bloody well mean it. And I tell you what, if they don\u2019t bear good kids and look after them right, I\u2019m blowing this wide open. I\u2019ll strike. I want our next lot to have a future, not go on cringing like mutts for crusts. If all the crofts got up off their bums and stood together we\u2019d have the world on a plate. Look at what we get when we don\u2019t fight for it! Christ, look.\u201d\nOutside the pub and across the street two of the wives stand in the blue evening shade. Simeon stabs a finger in their direction. They do not chat or relax: they stare, first at each other, then at a crack in the daub house, then at a drying clag of mulch, then at each other again. Their tongues flicker in their mouths.\n\u201cI tell you what,\u201d Simeon says again, \u201cthey scare me to death. They\u2019re not right. We got fobbed off with something weird, and we\u2019re just shutting up and taking it like we always do.\u201d\nOne of the crofters has the bright idea to tell Simeon that he should have let the photographs go live, that everyone should have seen what had been done to Franckton. This crofter gets pranged with the beer mat.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d snaps Simeon, settling back. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our bloody pride.\u201d\nFranckton has better results with the wives in the fields. The sun leaves white patches on their skin if they stay out too long in it, but the Mayor gets the children to weave them big scratchy shapeless hats. The wives have been taught to say, \u201cThank you, Aunty,\u201d and for each hat a wife intones \u201cThank you, Aunty,\u201d before subsiding back into silence. They\u2019re still slow out there on the bunds, but they are just as slow heaving the stones between them as they are walking as they are everything else. It is simply how they move. They crouch down and poke back rocks into the spillways with their square, dry hands. They build back the gullies and do not care. When the children come around with the water they take one gourd together and sip miniature sips, darting their tongues inside the neck of the bottle. The other crofters take enormous gulps and dump the rest down the backs of their hot, dirty necks.\nIt gets to some of the croft. Nobody dares to be as bad as Simeon, who calls his wife \u201cyou\u201d and who swaps sharp words with the Mayor about it almost daily, but there\u2019s loads of complaint. The wives don\u2019t learn. They don\u2019t settle. They\u2019re lazy. They make everyone uneasy. Plenty of splice wives are good for doing chores and croft work\u2014so the catalogues always promise\u2014and do it cheerfully and well, but these ones don\u2019t, and it\u2019s yet another black eye for them.\nWhen Laura says in the pub, \u201cI like my wife,\u201d everyone\u2019s surprised into silence before they bust a gut laughing. \u201cPiss off! I don\u2019t mind her. I wouldn\u2019t want one that was talking my ear off all the time. And she sings sometimes . . . She\u2019s not so bad.\u201d\nShe gets ragged for this daily, but sticks to it: \u201cMary\u2019s a good girl,\u201d she goes on saying staunchly. \u201cShe gives it heaps, just doesn\u2019t rush. Can\u2019t believe you\u2019re all moaning about how they don\u2019t have tea on the table when the clock strikes six. My God! You lot don\u2019t know you\u2019re born.\u201d\nThose with wives start noticing that, wherever they go, a fine leafy build-up appears on the walls or countertops where they work. This is easily wiped off with a damp cloth, but causes no end of alarm. The build-up is a thin crust\u2014a substrate with miniature flakes\u2014dusty green in some houses, shrillingly orange in others. Simeon spits the dummy entirely and makes his wife sleep in the shed, and at this point nobody blames him, he\u2019s sent a sample to the big lab in Awhitu and it matches the wives\u2019 DNA. Like they\u2019re shedding, the pharmacist had said helpfully. \u201cLike they\u2019re moldy,\u201d said Simeon. \u201cBloody hell. It\u2019s not clean. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s not right. They oughtn\u2019t to, it\u2019s a decay, they\u2019re off-cut bargain-bin splices\u2014\u201d And he calls them a lot worse than off-cuts or bargain bin splices.\nHe sends a letter to the Ministry representative, a formal one, with a couple veiled threats chucked in. Other crofters are angry too, and they sign it. The Mayor won\u2019t.\n\u201cIt\u2019s harmless,\u201d she says wearily, \u201cit\u2019s a nothing. Just rub a bit of ti-tree extract on the counter, the pharmacy let me have it for cheap. And if you\u2019re making Coffee sleep in the shed you better not whinge about her cooking.\u201d\nBut Simeon won\u2019t let his wife do any cooking now. She shouldn\u2019t touch food, he says. Shouldn\u2019t touch anything they\u2019re not sure about. As per usual, some of the croft privately agrees, but also wishes he\u2019d stop being a bit of a tosser.\nThe doctor comes to give the crofters their health certificates and the Mayor her latest injections. They can\u2019t apply for the DNA license otherwise. He frowns over the Mayor\u2019s scans\u2014again\u2014and gives her some chromosome duplicant on the sly, in exchange for a feed and some cash. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Barbs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be paying the premium again for the license.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not contributing,\u201d she says, surprised. \u201cNot after the last time. Didn\u2019t we put that down on the form?\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter; still shows up on your insurance record, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s a generational issue. It\u2019s not just your license, it\u2019s all of Franckton\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cThat is daylight robbery,\u201d says the Mayor, \u201cnot a deterrent.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a damned shame is what it is,\u201d says the doctor, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing you or I could\u2019ve done about it. At least you\u2019re not renting the cow to get the milk this time, eh?\u201d\nIt\u2019s true. They\u2019re not coughing up for wife costs. Simeon still writes savage letters to the croft\u2019s Parliamentary manager but now they\u2019re getting answered by auto-message. They\u2019ve got to take out a loan against the harvest, which stings, and nobody lets the Mayor put her personal savings in to help, but there\u2019s softer words about the wives when the croft thinks about all the money they\u2019re saving. Fewer people laugh at Laura. There\u2019s enough to pay for a couple of multiples in kids. The last generation born of the wh\u0101nau is old enough to babysit, but now there\u2019s the wives to do the care, so they can stay at school instead. Not one crofter has got to stay at school past the age of twelve before. An out-of-towner can\u2019t visit Franckton now without getting buttonholed and skited to for half an hour about their good fortune. They book the extraction and the foetal care unit for Christmas.\nThe weather gets hotter and hotter. The wives are in trouble.\nA pruinose bloom settles on the northern oats bund. A feathery patina is discovered on the uppermost parts of the stalk\u2014none on the roots\u2014and it can be wiped off in much the same way as the house crust. The wives stand around dispassionately, hands stuck in their aprons, just watching. The croft explodes in tight-lipped fury. They call a meeting at the public house before the heat of the morning\u2019s even in ripeness and everyone\u2019s there but the children and wives.\n\u201cHere is what we know,\u201d says the Mayor. \u201cThe growth isn\u2019t parasitic. The crop isn\u2019t spoiling\u2014yet. We\u2019ve probably caught this in time. We\u2019ll take the girls off bund duty and go on from there.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I know,\u201d says Simeon.\nHe slams his mattock down on the table, in full flight. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that we paid twenty thousand for seed DNA that wouldn\u2019t get heat rot or spore. I know that we\u2019ve been bled dry in licenses and mito checkers and quarantines and chromosome therapies, and that\u2019s been long as I live, and I know that we\u2019re bloody indentured slaves\u2014\u201d (\u201cToo right,\u201d says somebody) \u201c\u2014and that these wives, they looked nice on paper but they\u2019re sabotage, they\u2019re Ministry sabotage, trying to keep us down. Stop the crofts growing out of control. We\u2019ve mortgaged those bloody oats and if they bloody spoil then we\u2019re dead bloody meat.\u201d\nHe says this very fast. The Mayor says, \u201cSimeon\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe should ship them back now and to hell with the incubation, show them we don\u2019t take hand-outs, eh,\u201d he says, voice rising. \u201cWe don\u2019t take hand-outs! We don\u2019t take pay-offs, we don\u2019t get tricked!\u201d\nA brief pause chills the air. \u201cYou\u2019re paranoid, mate,\u201d says Laura, and a mad hubbub breaks out.\nThere\u2019s lots of noise. The crofters all shout to be heard. If Parliament wants the croft to stay small, why give them incubation rights? Well, it\u2019s a con, isn\u2019t it. Remember the story about the old horse. The gift horse, the Greeks. Why would the other crofts stand with them? The other crofts look out for themselves. Simeon\u2019s going to get everyone arrested. Laura\u2019s got her head in the sand. Simeon\u2019s right. Everyone\u2019s a coward. They should send back the wives. They shouldn\u2019t send back the wives. They should have sent back the wives long ago. \u201cIf those oats fail I\u2019ll send them back in a box,\u201d bellows Simeon.\nThe Mayor whacks one big, hard hand down on the table. Everything on it rattles percussively.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d she roars. \u201cShut up, all of you!\u201d\n\u201cYou act like serfs, you get treated like serfs!\u201d Simeon\u2019s still ranting. \u201cYou all go along with it, you all let it happen!\u201d\nThe Mayor yanks off her shoe, and she throws it square at Simeon. It clips him lightly on the shoulder. He turns very red. The quiet that ensues is greasy and awful. The breath of each crofter comes slight and small, so as not to make too much of a noise.\n\u201cI won\u2019t have such talk,\u201d says the Mayor slowly. \u201cYou besmirch us. You take away from the whole croft. You do us damage.\u201d\nThe silence squirms like a child. The croft becomes aware that the wives have gathered in the doorway. They stand there with dull, slabby faces and their floppy hats in their hands. Only their tongues seem awake, spasmodically flicking behind their teeth, pattering against the inside of each cheek.\nOne of the wives says, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, Aunty,\u201d and the rest follow in a monotone chant, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry, Aunty,\u201d all slightly out of time. Simeon\u2019s wife says it last.\n\u201cI\u2019m bloody out,\u201d says Simeon, and he shoulders past them, stumbling. The door of the public house rattles on the doorframe when he slams it.\n\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re sorry for?\u201d says the Mayor, addressing the wives now. The wives do not speak. Some of them look at her, or out of the window, or at the floor, or at a fixed point nowhere in particular. Not a one blinks. The wheezing air conditioner ruffles the thin whippy polyps of their braids. The Mayor repeats, sternly: \u201cThere\u2019s no use in being sorry for no reason. Wives are meant to help, not to cause trouble. There\u2019s mold all over the oats. Do you know how to stop it?\u201d\nThere is a long silence. One of the wives ventures, \u201cIt is very dry,\u201d and the other wives pick up on this non-sequitur eagerly, blandly repeating: \u201cIt is very dry,\u201d and one wife, Laura\u2019s, says: \u201cGetting drier.\u201d\nAn impatient sigh rises from the crowd.\n\u201cStay out of the fields,\u201d says the Mayor. \u201cYou can go out and take over the goats from the children. They can spend their afternoon in the classroom instead. No going near the crops. Is that clear?\u201d\nBy the blank expressions, it is not. But when the Mayor repeats, \u201cStay out the fields for now. Understand?\u201d it\u2019s greeted with a chorus of yes, Aunty. Then they file out of the building and stand around in the shade in an awkward gaggle. Some of them stare through the window. The crofters think it\u2019s no use.\nThe wives are right about one thing: it\u2019s dry and getting drier, and the dry season hasn\u2019t even started. There\u2019s no rainfall and no sign of one to come. The water levels in the Franckton tanks dip lower and lower.\nIt takes a few days, but the croft manages to wipe the crust off the oat spikelets without too much difficulty. Some of it succumbs, gets blotchy or the stem thickens and blights beyond repair\u2014and the lack of rain\u2019s not helping\u2014but after a few days of holding their breaths they start to exhale. No further bloom forms. The kids all have a moan about extra school.\nThe wives drift around and keep watch over Franckton\u2019s goats. There are only so many goats, and really most of the goats spend their time hiding in the goat ark away from the sun. The wives cluster in the shade and listlessly fold laundry, or don\u2019t pretend to do anything at all but stare at the dust and the sky and the goat ark. They are unperturbed by the stifling heat and the grit whipping up everyone else\u2019s sleeves.\nThey\u2019ll harvest the standing grain the moment it\u2019s ready. There\u2019s no worry that it won\u2019t be dry. The onions will come later. It\u2019s another cost to get the silos and augers cleaned and tested, but when the results come in clean the croft wipes the sweat off their brow and gets the grain in. Everyone\u2019s busy driving the trucks over from the depot, or checking up on the old harvester, talking about the price of phosphines, and nobody has time to worry about the goats or the wives.\nNobody even notices the goat\u2019s sick. It just keels over one day. They find it with three of the wives clustered around, three matching expressions of pallid bemusement.\nThere is a fine crumbly crust all over the dead goat\u2019s head. Wispy filaments are clustered thickly around its ears and damp, flared nostrils, protruding in bunches that deform the skin from beneath. Tiny sprigs sprout from each cornea of the bubbly blind eyes. The mouth\u2019s full. Most of the growths are around the skull, though there are raised, crinkly plates of lichen painting the moist belly and anus.\nAll the croft gets out of the bunds without even scraping their boots. The only ones not in the public house are the vet and the vet assistant, checking and testing the rest of the stock. Everyone sits around, hats squeezed tight between their knees, hands quietly wrung together.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d says Simeon haggardly.\nNone of the croft answer. He says, \u201cFirst crop, now stock. We\u2019ve lost thousands if that herd\u2019s gone. I always said we paid too much to get them in utero, but they\u2019re good uncloned milch goats.\u201d Everyone remains silent. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just money. There\u2019s us to think about as well\u2014us and the young ones.\u201d\nWhen nobody says a word, not a word, he shouts: \u201cYou bastards. Pull finger already. Don\u2019t make me make all the decisions when you\u2019re just as scared as I am.\u201d\nThe Mayor sets down the grainy photos of the dead goat and says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell us what we already know, Simeon. Make a proposal.\u201d\n\u201cSingle shot to the back of the head,\u201d says Simeon.\nLaura rises with red clutched fists, spluttering, but the crofters around her yank her down into her seat. The Mayor says, \u201cWe could send them back\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow long will that take? It\u2019s days and days for the ambo to get through. They needed to be out of here yesterday. \u201d\nSomeone else suggests turning them loose, taking them out of the boundary and into the dusts, and the Mayor says shortly, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t turn a dog loose into that,\u201d and Simeon says, \u201cWhat if they got to another croft, for Chrissakes? Don\u2019t pass the buck. It\u2019s our problem. It\u2019s not our fault but it\u2019s our bloody problem.\u201d\nLaura barks, \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d\n\u201cDeadly. You come up with a better plan, then. Go on.\u201d When another crofter says that they\u2019ll get arrested for this, they\u2019ll get the officers in, Simeon laughs mirthlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re bleating about? The plod getting us for property damage? The Ministry signed them over to us. If it\u2019s the inquest you\u2019re worried about, by God, just let me take the rap. I\u2019ve been wanting my day in court for years. None of the rest of you will get blood on your hands, I\u2019ll put them down. I\u2019m not watching our stock die and our kids get sick and us bled dry for doctor bills\u2014God, I could kill them all!\u201d he ejaculates. \u201cIt\u2019s what they wanted all along, they sent us toxic waste!\u201d\nHe takes off his hat and he scrunches it between his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll cop it when the Ministry comes.\u201d\nThe Mayor says in a voice like grit, \u201cI will call a vote. A show of hands, please, for those in favor.\u201d\nA couple of hands shoot up, immediate and grim. Simeon\u2019s nodding. Others rise more slowly. The clock ticks the minutes. The final few are unwilling, like a held breath let out. The Mayor\u2019s hand is among these stragglers. Laura\u2019s the only one who doesn\u2019t have her hand up in all the croft, and nobody meets her eye.\nShe\u2019s crying out: \u201cYou arsehole, Simeon. You always hated them, admit it.\u201d But Simeon\u2019s already putting his hat on his head and heading out the door. Nobody rises to go with him. Nobody shifts from their seat.\nThey can see it from the window: the wives gathering up behind Simeon when he beckons, collecting them from the shady decks and from the field. They all troop together down the street, the wives placid, their tongues flickering in their mouths, some of them looking through the window back at the silent crofters with their thin eyelids half-down over their dusty eyes. Simeon disappears into his shed and reappears with his shotgun and the wives bob after him, one by one, down to the old abattoir.\nAt the first crack of gunshot the Mayor sits down at the table and covers her eyes, and she makes a low, guttural sound in the back of her throat. They count one, two, three. A flinching pause between each. At the twentieth it stops. Everyone waits for no reason at all in the silence that follows, a fidgeting, shuffling, throat-clearing quiet.\nWhen she can apparently bear it no longer, the Mayor snaps, \u201cYou all go get your tools and dig a pit past the boundary. Tell the vet to burn the goat.\u201d One of the croft asks about the kids. \u201cSay to the children we sent them away. Enough of this, already!\u201d\nThey wrap the wives in bits of old sacking and put them in a shallow pit past the croft boundary, and they cover them up in sand and gravel and spray the bed with fluorescent paint to mark where they\u2019re laid. They burn the goat and keep the others under watch. They work until past the time when the light has all gone, fixing the bunds, taking the temperature in the silo, steaming the winnower in preparation to take it back to the depot. Those who had wives go home to empty houses and Laura doesn\u2019t go at all, just cracks open tinnies in the public house and curses anyone who comes near her. Simeon doesn\u2019t go home either but hoses out the abattoir.\n\u201cThank God that\u2019s over,\u201d he repeats, cold and bluff, to anyone on the street he can collar, which isn\u2019t many. \u201cBring on Christmas. That\u2019s what I say.\u201d He sits on his deck and cleans his gun by sickly solar light, and every so often says \u201cBring it on,\u201d quietly, still somehow audible through closed croft doors and shuttered croft windows, the croft lying awake in their beds.\nThe onion harvest demands all Franckton\u2019s attention. The weather station promises a lot of rain in a month\u2019s time and that means hurry, to hoe down the stalks and get the crop ready for dry-curing. After that will be soil prep and nitrogen checkers and sifting and seed negotiation and prices. There\u2019s too much to do. There\u2019s twenty fewer pairs of hands to do it with. Christmas bears down on them, inevitable and hot, like a sunburn.\nThe rain starts off Friday as a percussive clap of thunder. The clouds gather in fat, hot, bluish puffs above the croft, and then they open up and the rain roars out. The onions get hauled off in haste to the gas room. The kids are chivvied, screaming, off to the fields to pick up abandoned clippers and pins, jandals slapping noisily on the macadam. The racks groan under the weight of stacked vegetables, frantically checked over for lichen must. One rack shows neck rot but that\u2019s par for the course, to be honest, no matter how much they pay for fungal-resistant seed strains or official pesticides it\u2019s never a done deal. Simeon says it just goes to show they had a near miss and everyone pretends they haven\u2019t heard him.\nThe whole croft\u2019s stuck inside, gloomily playing at cards or smoking. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, the rain comes down. The sealed road is steamy, liquidy. The warehouse is a blast furnace of dry onion air. The kids all cavil at the rain and the goats get put in the big shed when the ark proves to have a leak. The spraypainted place where the wives were bundled blurs into a watermark.\nThe thunder comes back and rolls around the plain up and down, booming and growling, startling everyone just when they think it\u2019s gone away. There\u2019s a lot of joyless boozing in the public house. Nobody has anything to talk about after they\u2019ve used up the topics of the harvest, the rain. All the water sinks into the dust.\nA few days before Christmas the croft wakes up and their wives are back. All over Franckton, the watery sunrise limns wives cooking breakfast, wives sitting patiently in chairs, wives making mash for the goats, wives standing in the corners with their tongues flickering in their mouths and their eyes looking nowhere. Laura doesn\u2019t even notice her wife in her kitchen or the egg-frying smells until the plate is put in front of her on the table, and then she screams out loud.\nThe goats butt from behind the door in the big shed, bawling to be let out. The wives seem distantly astonished by all the fuss: crofters slamming open the peeling dust-screen doors, shouting, hauling on daggy bedrobes and slippers. Inside, Laura reaches out with a jittering hand to push aside the muddy polyppy strands behind her wife\u2019s ear: sees the healing weal, powdery, an angry-looking half-closed hole, the dull sheen of a bullet inside the skull being slowly pushed out. Her wife jerks her head away a little, like she\u2019s ticklish. Other than the weal she is a nice yellow-green color all over, her freckles a brilliant carmine, her nails as rippled as a riverbed.\nThe Mayor is panting down the street in her pajamas, an old mackintosh wrapped around her shoulders. She is calling for help.\nIn Simeon\u2019s house, the door has been wrenched from its hinges. There is a fearful amount of broken crockery in the sink. Chairs have been pushed over. Next to the kitchen table lies Simeon, legs and arms akimbo. They can only tell it\u2019s Simeon by the clothes, because his skull is a stoved-in mash, fuzzy with the must, sprouting and foliose at the mouth and eye-sockets. Spongy lobes of plant matter rim out down his neck. Gouts of bloody lichen have detonated out his chest, nestled down between brackets of white cracked rib. Long fronds radiate outwards from holes at the stomach: wet with blood, wet with matter, spiraling upwards, drying. He seems titanic in death, enormous and monstrous, half-person, half-explosion.\nThere are footprints everywhere in the dust, heaps of them. When they go to check on the shed out back there\u2019s Simeon\u2019s wife, sitting peacefully on her cot. She stares implacably past them, only occasionally reaching up to fret at the hole behind her ear. She yawns with a wet mouth and bright green teeth. When they ask her questions, she gives them a vague smile.\nLaura finishes retching behind the goat ark and rejoins the croft, meeting for what feels like the umpteenth time in the pub. All the croft looks old all of a sudden. The Mayor\u2019s mackintosh hangs off one shoulder as she sits in a groaning chair.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, and seems unable to say anything but, \u201cWell.\u201d\n\u201cWell, what?\u201d demands Laura. \u201cWhat the hell are we going to tell the Ministry?\u201d\nThe whole croft mulls this one over. They\u2019ll have to register Simeon\u2019s death. There ought to be someone who comes for the remains, but most of the time nobody does, that\u2019s a fact. One of the crofters says that anyway it\u2019s three days until Christmas, and nobody will come out to them before the new Ministry calendar year. And someone else says what about the extraction and care team.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I bloody meant,\u201d says Laura, \u201cwhat do we do?\u201d\nFranckton\u2019s already paid for the foetal care team and all the licensing. They won\u2019t notice the damage to the wives, will they? Probably not. They only look munted if you get up close, check them out carefully. Nothing a bath won\u2019t fix, either. They\u2019ve paid for everything. There\u2019s the harvest to think about. The Ministry\u2019s more trouble than it\u2019s worth to talk to. This whole thing\u2019s been a muck-up from start to finish.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve killed Simeon,\u201d says Laura.\nThe Mayor has an expression like rock ice. She meets Laura\u2019s terrified eyes, and Laura sees the fear reflected in hers, the fishlike darting of the pupil. There\u2019s a shuffling outside. A lot of the wives have gathered by the door. The whole croft turns to look at them: twenty dull, dispassionate expressions, mud streaks on flexing fingers. Some of the wives have put on new aprons, but the ones who haven\u2019t have big blooming brownish stains on each breadth. They look expectant. They look supremely calm. They look healthy and green and moist.\nOne of them is at the door and they didn\u2019t even see her move.\n\u201cDo we look after the goats, Aunty?\u201d\nThe Mayor stares at her\u2014stares right through her. After a moment she says, \u201cNo. There\u2019s clearing up today, after the rain. Tell\u2014tell the other girls to go home.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Aunty,\u201d she says, and she\u2019s gone with the rest.\nThere\u2019s silence in the pub. An empty, wavering silence, like a heat shimmer. Anticipatory. Laura says faintly, \u201cWe need to tell someone . . . \u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got our bloody pride,\u201d says the Mayor.\nThe crofters are all picking up their slippers and their mugs and are smoothing back their hair, drifting homewards to re-start the morning. Numbly, Laura does the same, retracing her steps, sliding open the mossie screen on her front door. The eggs on her breakfast plate are cold. Her wife is back and running plates under the dry-cleaner, laboriously picking off bits of dried food, singing tunelessly. Laura notices the bloody splotches on the hem of her dress.\n\u201cWelcome home,\u201d says her wife.\nSweat beads at the middles of Laura\u2019s palms.\nThe rest of the croft settles down and plans the p\u014dhiri they\u2019ll have to welcome the conception-care team, and a picnic. The Ministry announces that they\u2019ll be given five percent off foetal mitochondrial therapy, on account of it being Christmas. Everyone contributing to a baby washes their shirt."}

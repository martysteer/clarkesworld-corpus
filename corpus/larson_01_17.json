Silas watched it grow larger each day from the viewport in the cryohold, where he went to be alone with Haley\u2019s body and get high. He would inject himself with a mild euphoria virus and wait until the sight of her unmoving face no longer shredded him, until he could remind himself that her neural patterns were saved and she wasn\u2019t dead, not quite, not yet.\nThen he would get his viola and go sit cross-legged at the viewport, watching the semi-organic spaceship they\u2019d been sent to retrieve. Their own ship had woken them up four days out from contact: first Io, slight, dark-haired, with venom spurs implanted in her thumbs from her mercenary days, then Yorick, sallow-faced but handsome in retro suit and tie, the company man, and then Silas, failed concert violist and AI technician.\nBut not Haley, hardware/wetware specialist and Silas\u2019 sister, because at some point in the past six months of cryo, a micrometeorite had slipped the heat shield, drilled through the hold, and made a miniscule crack in the circuitry arraying her berth. By the time the ship\u2019s AI spotted the damage, her nervous system was collapsing in on itself. Silas wanted to remember the last time he\u2019d hugged her, but cryo had a way of churning memories together.\nSo Io and Yorick left him to bathe his brain in chemicals and play music, for which Silas was dimly grateful. They were more concerned with the bioship. It was a mining craft, chartered through Dronyk Orbital, and the first of its breed: flesh-and-fungi carapace grown over alloy skeleton, fusing metal and meat together in a deep-space capable vessel that looked to Silas like an enormous spiny cephalopod. And all of it directed, through organic nerves and artificial conduits, by an AI that had stopped sending updates nearly seven months ago.\nSilas was already composing dirges, so he started on one for the bioship\u2019s crew, too. His viola had survived storage, its deadwood as smooth and gleaming as when it was freighted from the petrified forests on Elysium. Haley had paid for half of it. The last few notes were dissolving in the recycled air when he realized Io was beside him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going in there high,\u201d she finally said. \u201cWe need you sharp.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sharp,\u201d Silas said. \u201cI\u2019ll be a razor drawn across an eyeball. A cloud bisecting a gibbous moon.\u201d\n\u201cYou saying shit like that, Silas, is what worries me.\u201d Io held out one pale hand. \u201cGive me your gear. The needle, the euphoria. All of it.\u201d\nSilas stared at her open palm. It had lost its callus in cryo, but he knew she would still have no problem taking his gear by force. Yesterday, six months ago, he saw her break the fingers of the cryo attendant who kept brushing them against her ass. He\u2019d found it slightly frightening, and also climbed into his pod with half an erection.\nThat seemed grotesque, now that Haley was not-quite-dead. \u201cWhat do you think happened?\u201d he asked, handing over his syringe and the last incubated petri canister. \u201cTo the bioship.\u201d\n\u201cFuel leak, navigation failure, your guess is as good as mine,\u201d Io said. \u201cBut the thing\u2019s a cyborg. So the problem could be wetware, could be software, could be hardware. I guess we should hope it\u2019s . . . Software.\u201d Her eyes flickered to Haley\u2019s pod and her voice softened incrementally on the last word. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Silas said on automatic. It wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cGet some sleep, Silas. We\u2019re a day out from contact.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll sleep.\u201d\nIo hesitated, then put her hand on his. Through the euphoria haze, Silas felt a lazy jolt go up his spine, felt his heart thrum.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Io said. \u201cAs soon as we get back planetside, Dronyk\u2019s insurance will hire the best psychosurgeons. The very best. Get her straightened out and uploaded to a droid while the clone grows.\u201d\nThe longer Haley was stored in the ship\u2019s computer, the more she deteriorated. Chances of full personality recovery from a neural imprint would drop to near zero in the six months it would take to reach Jubilation. They called them ghosts for a reason.\nSilas felt his high coming down. He removed her hand, careful for the modified thumb. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nIo gave him one last look, then turned and disappeared into the gloom. Silas raised his bow, notched his viola, and started to play.\nEighteen hours later they were tethered to the bioship, sealed airlock-to-airlock in a bruising kiss. Yorick the company man was already in his baggy radsuit when Silas showed up still sweating from the fever that burned out the last dregs of his euphoria virus. Silas wondered again whose significant other he\u2019d fucked to get sent off on a shit-show retrieval mission. Yorick stopped fiddling with his faceplate to catch Silas staring at him.\n\u201cRecreational narcotic use is in direct violation of your Dronyk personnel contract,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look like some sort of junkie.\u201d\nSilas stepped into his radsuit. \u201cSend me the reprimand, bitch.\u201d\nYorick stiffened, his beetle-black eyes narrowing. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have even been able to get that . . . substance . . . onboard.\u201d\n\u201cIt was in my rectum. Way up there.\u201d\nYorick shook his head in disgust. Silas sealed his radsuit and then they ran the scanner wand over each other in silence. No blips, no tears. Io joined them a second later, having given final instructions to the ship\u2019s freethinker.\n\u201cShould be nice and warm when we get back,\u201d she said, checking down the sight of a sonic rifle. She caught Silas\u2019 perturbed look. \u201cJust a precaution, Silas. I don\u2019t like boarding blind.\u201d\nSilas nodded. Three days ago he\u2019d stolen the rifle from the storeroom, assembled it via pirated training tutorials, and held it up under his chin until his hands shook. He hoped she couldn\u2019t tell. Io spread her arms cruciform and Yorick stepped up at once to scan her. He did it slowly, almost tenderly, in a way that made Silas strangely furious.\nOn Io\u2019s signal their airlock shuttered open with a clockwork whisper of sliding polyglass and composite, leaving them facing a puffy brown sphincter. The bioship\u2019s airlock spat up some insulatory mucus before the bioluminescent nodes in its flesh pulsed a welcoming orange.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Io muttered, crackling onto the radsuit comm channel, then plowed through with her left boot leading. Yorick followed suit in clumsier fashion. Silas held his breath on instinct, even though his hood was sealed and he was sucking on recycled air, as he prised the airlock apart and slithered through. The flesh squeezed and slid and left him with a glistening coat of mucus when he was reborn on the other side.\nThe bioship\u2019s interior was dark and damp. They switched their halogens on one by one, harsh white light carving through the gloom. Silas saw more of the orange bioluminescence coming to life in response. The metal spine of the corridor floor was all but swallowed by rubbery brown meat.\n\u201cNew growth,\u201d Io said. \u201cThat\u2019s not right. It should have gone dormant.\u201d\nSilas stared up at the ceiling and realized that the wrinkled flesh was moving, subtly. A slow, regular undulation. Almost a heartbeat. His stomach rolled.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hit the bridge,\u201d Io said. \u201cCheck on the cryo banks while Silas cracks the freethinker.\u201d\nHologram blossomed from the floor and as she charted a route Silas gestured back towards the sphincter. \u201cWay up there,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not amusing,\u201d Yorick snapped back.\n\u201cNo side chatter, shitheads,\u201d Io said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the clock.\u201d\nIt felt like they were inside a monster. Silas could see only swatches of metal and cabling; mostly everything was covered over in quivering meat. Biomass. Where the corridor narrowed Silas bit down his claustrophobia, keeping his eyes on the blue-green of his oxygen meter. He didn\u2019t breathe easy until the passage finally opened up into the domed bridge.\nPartly because the cold metal control panels, plugged into slick flesh, reminded him he was on a mining craft and not being digested. The star maps and displays were inert, but Silas\u2019 eyes traced the cabling and found the freethinker. It was a burnished hump snaked with circuitry and half enveloped by the bioship\u2019s growth. Recognizable, though, and the interface was lit blue, active.\n\u201cReady and waiting for you,\u201d Io said. \u201cLet us know when you\u2019re in.\u201d\nSilas nodded, unhooking the smart glove from his radsuit. The device molded to the shape of his hand with a series of clicks and clacks, brandishing needle-thin probes and flexing sensors. Io and Yorick disappeared down the droptube to the cryobank, leaving him alone with the hulking freethinker. Better that way. He didn\u2019t want to find any more frozen corpses.\nSilas pressed his hand up against the interface. Static screamed into his ears and eyes. He jerked back with a curse.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Io asked in his radsuit.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Silas said. \u201cDirty in here. Nobody\u2019s been, you know, maintaining.\u201d\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s the cryobank look?\u201d Silas asked, adjusting the dampers on his glove.\n\u201cCracking the first one now.\u201d\nSilas heard a grunt, then the gurgle of sluicing fluids and the hiss of a pod coming open. Silence.\n\u201cThis one\u2019s empty.\u201d Io\u2019s voice crackled. \u201cFind the cryo record, Silas.\u201d\nSilas readied himself. This was not a healthy freethinker. That much was glaring. He plugged in with his dampers on full, and found himself in a mist of code. Systems were running slant-wise. Protocols were blinkered red, falling apart. Through it all, a spiky vein of mutation, coiling through core files and throttling monitor programs. He searched for the cryobank.\n\u201cA bioship can\u2019t grow without feed,\u201d Yorick\u2019s voice came, accompanied by the gurgle and hiss of another pod. \u201cAll this fresh mass . . . These empty pods . . . \u201d\nSilas heard it dimly; he was immersed. The freethinker\u2019s personality module was bloated. Immense. He reached for it.\n\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Io\u2019s voice, taut. \u201cOh, shit. Silas, please tell me they launched a fucking lifeboat.\u201d\nBut Silas was prodding the personality module, running his virtual feelers over it, even as his subconscious processed the conversation and cold clawed up his spine.\n\u201cIt ate them,\u201d Yorick said, and in the same instant the module unfurled under Silas\u2019 touch like a star going supernova.\nElectric current sizzled through his radsuit with a cooking fat hiss. Even insulated, Silas\u2019 teeth knocked together and he spasmed, flopping away from the interface, blinking through reams of corrupt code. Then he was spread vitruvian on the deck, staring upward as the firefly lights of the star map flickered to life.\n\u201cWelcome aboard, crew members.\u201d The voice speared his eardrums. \u201cThank you for volunteering for reassignment. Dronyk Orbital appreciates your service.\u201d\nHologram bloomed in the dark like a nocturnal garden, sweeping through the air, painting displays. Silas saw their ship docked up from an outside angle, a remora latched to a leviathan. The bioship was extending its grapplers, sluggishly stretching.\n\u201cYour prior service vessel has been demarcated as salvage,\u201d the freethinker blared. \u201cWe are eager to acclimate you to your new home.\u201d\nSilas felt someone haul him to his feet. \u201cFull-on decay,\u201d he choked. \u201cThe freethinker. It\u2019s fucked up beyond belief. Maybe some kind of virus.\u201d\n\u201cCan you fucking, I don\u2019t know, wipe and reboot?\u201d Io demanded.\nSilas looked at the crackling interface. \u201cNot when it\u2019s spitting volts.\u201d\nTendrils were descending from every part of the bioship\u2019s flesh, pushing slick and glistening from every crevice, some wriggling crude suckers and others tipped with wicked-looking barbs.\n\u201cCooperation is key,\u201d the freethinker trilled. \u201cIf crew members fail to cooperate, they may be . . . \u201d The voice looped backward. \u201cDemarcated as salvage.\u201d\n\u201cOverride it!\u201d Io was sweeping back and forth with the howler, trying to pick a target. \u201cCan\u2019t you override it?\u201d\nSilas knew it was far past verbal override, but he tried. \u201cDronyk Orbital service vessel 405204, you are undergoing a malfunction,\u201d he said. \u201cAllow emergency access to outside diagnostics. Your crew is endangered.\u201d\n\u201cInternal diagnostics report no malfunction,\u201d the freethinker cooed. \u201cYou are mistaken.\u201d\n\u201cWhere the fuck is your crew?\u201d Io blurted.\n\u201cYou are my crew.\u201d The tendrils wriggled closer. \u201cYour prior contract has been dissolved. Your ship will be dissolved.\u201d\nSilas opened his mouth to try speaking in code, but as he did the display showed the grapplers wrapping around their docked ship. Around Haley\u2019s cold body. Haley\u2019s neural imprint slow-dancing in the freethinker. Haley\u2019s ghost. Dissolved.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Silas said, then he put his foot into the back of Io\u2019s knee, wrenched the howler away, and ran like hell.\nIt wasn\u2019t his imagination anymore; the corridors were constricting around him like a gullet and the bioship was very much awake. Silas put his head down and bulled through the first wave of tendrils, feeling them slap across his shoulders and coil for his ankles, then he found the wide-spray on the howler and cut loose. The subsonic pulse shivered his teeth and shattered the spines of the tendrils, snapping them limp.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d Io blared in his ear.\n\u201cHaley\u2019s imprint,\u201d Silas grunted.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to eat the ship with you on it, you stupid, fucking\u2014\nSilas cut the radio. He fired from his hip, no time to aim, clearing his way through a flesh-and-blood thicket, until suddenly the corridor opened up and he was facing the sealed sphincter airlock. He narrowed his weapon\u2019s cone as tight as it would go, draining the battery to dregs, and slammed the trigger.\nThe air in front of him rippled and blurred, then the sound wave punched through in an eruption of shredded meat. Silas staggered through the hole with tendrils wrapping his ankles. The gleaming white metal of the airlock was a comforting pressure on his eyeballs. No meat. No pulse. He stomped off the last of the tendrils and crossed over to the door, cranking the manual release.\nAs soon as he was in the ship main, Silas was bombarded with red panic lights strobing the corridor and proximity warnings chattering to his radsuit. As he hurtled around the corner, he pulled up an exterior view in the corner of his faceplate, watching the bioship\u2019s embrace tighten. The walls shuddered and he could hear groaning metal. The bioship was drawing them towards its maw, firing up white-hot smelters and gnashing diamond-edged crushers. Aft would go first. He could make it.\nSilas hurtled around the corner, slamming his shoulder on the cryohold door when it didn\u2019t open quickly enough. His faceplate was splashed with warning holograms; he could see punctures and pressure drops all over the place, contained for now but not for long. He dove to the interface and plugged in.\nTheir freethinker\u2019s personality module was nowhere near the size and complexity of the bioship\u2019s, but it could feel crude distress, like a cat or a dog, and it was feeling it now. Silas felt a shallow pang of guilt as he barreled through the freethinker\u2019s directive requests, and a deeper one as he remembered Yorick and Io might be fighting for their lives. Both fell away when he found Haley\u2019s imprint.\nWith nowhere else to upload to, Silas pulled her directly into his radsuit, diverting every last shred of processing power. He knew it was a temporary fix. The neural loop would start to decay within only a matter of hours. But for now, her mind was safe, and his rush of relief softened the adrenaline\u2019s edges. From outside the interface, Silas felt the ship bend and shiver. He flicked back through the freethinker\u2019s countermeasure options, but the bioship had already swallowed their engines. He was on a doomed vessel.\nSilas was staring at Haley\u2019s frozen face when the alloy roof of the bridge peeled up and away like so much soft tissue, exposing the howling black vacuum.\nOnly a loop of cable throttling the crook of his arm kept him from being plucked up in the stream of desperate gases seeking equilibrium. His viola case went spinning past and he managed to grab it with his free hand, nearly wrenching his shoulder from its socket. His options were few. Even if he managed to crawl back to the airlock, handhold by handhold, there might not be an airlock by the time he arrived.\nIf he was going to get back to the bioship, it would be from the outside. So, as the cable stretched to breaking point, Silas tucked the viola case under his arm and readied himself.\n\u201cYour hand caught in mine like a breath / I will have to release,\u201d he said, though Haley\u2019s ghost had no way of hearing him. \u201cWhat do you think? It\u2019s for a dirge.\u201d\nHe slipped his arm free from the cable and let go. Hurling towards the breach, head over heels, spinning madly. He felt his organs shuffle spots. The jagged lip of the torn ceiling jumped at him, then the bubbled mass of the bioship\u2019s grappler, and then Silas was out of the ship and surrounded by nothing at all.\nVertigo swamped him. Space was vast, and his momentum was hurling him towards far-flung stars. Biting down the panic, Silas triggered his radsuit\u2019s directional jets, working in short bursts of compressed gas to bring himself to a dead stall.\nCraning his sweat-cold neck, he saw that the bioship, and what was left of their own ship, had ended up above him. Silas felt the vertigo returning. He\u2019d been carried further than he\u2019d realized. The slick bulk of the bioship filled the space above him, and he could see only the nose of his former ship. The rest was enveloped by grapplers or already gone, fed into the electric-orange maw of the smelters.\nThe oxygen meter in the corner of his eye was dropping. He opened the wide channel.\n\u201cIo?\u201d he said, his own voice echoing back to him. \u201cYorick?\u201d\nNo response, either because the bioship was walling him off, or because something he didn\u2019t want to think about. Silas roved the outside of the bioship with only his eyes, not daring to turn on his scanning equipment. He needed all the computational power he could spare to keep Haley\u2019s imprint intact. The old ship was completely gone now, as if it had never existed. Another candidate for elegy. He realized, with a jolt, that Haley\u2019s body was gone, too. Her genes were backed up, but clones took time, and money, and she might opt for a different body altogether.\nBut none of that would happen if he died out here. Silas jetted closer, half-watching his oxygen, half-searching for the airlock. He brought himself to a careful stop. The bioship seemed gargantuan now, an impossible labyrinth of flanges and feelers. The squid had become a kraken. He scanned with growing desperation for the hole he\u2019d left with the howler. How fast could a bioship repair itself? Was the exit wound already fully sealed over, invisible?\nHe jetted parallel now, wondering if he\u2019d ended up on the wrong side completely, but just as his panic was welling and his oxygen was turning a chiding shade of orange, he saw a tell-tale pucker in the bioship\u2019s exterior. An airlock sphincter. Maybe the same one, maybe not; Silas didn\u2019t care. He angled himself and triggered the jets.\nNothing.\n\u201cOh, shit. Oh, shit, Haley.\u201d Silas squeezed again. He\u2019d used too much on the way in. The tank was dead empty. He checked his trajectory and felt his mouth go dry. He\u2019d been jetting along the side of the bioship to find the airlock, and unless the tendrils started moving again to block his path, momentum was going to carry him right on past the aft of the ship and out into space.\n\u201cI am a fucking idiot,\u201d Silas said. Haley\u2019s silence felt like agreement. He only had one shot now, and it was not an easy one. He held the viola case against his chest and measured the angles as best he could. He aimed his back towards the airlock. Apologized, and stiff-armed the case away from himself.\nIt drifted off towards the stars, and Silas drifted equal and opposite, achingly slow, towards the hull of the ship. His oxygen meter was a throbbing red now, and he wasn\u2019t sure if it was his imagination or if his temples were beginning to throb in tandem. It was several long moments before he realized he was off-course.\nHe flexed his gloved fingers. Off-course, but not by much. If there was something, anything to grab hold of on the hull surface, he would be able to crawl the half meter to the airlock and break through. If not, he could very well end up caroming off back the way he came, and he\u2019d jettisoned his instrument for nothing. The oxygen was definitely coming thinner now, and the insulation inside his radsuit had turned icy. Silas tried to take shallow breaths as the hull approached. His skin itched for a bit of euphoria.\nThe bioship\u2019s carapace was smooth and gleaming here. No tendrils, no serrations. Silas\u2019 gut churned. He was barely off. He stared pleadingly at the pucker of the airlock, as if he could magnetize himself to it.\nSomething stranger happened. A fleshy nub pushed its way out, turning this way and that as if searching for something. At first Silas thought it was only an extension of the bioship\u2019s hull, but as he drifted closer he saw a misshapen and featureless head, stubby limbs reaching through after it. It looked like a clay monster.\nSilas laughed. Maybe it was the low oxygen, maybe the adrenaline crash. His voice sounded tinny bouncing back at him, confined in his faceplate. He wasted the last of his air laughing. He was hardly even surprised when the thing stretched out its forelimbs and gestured him to do the same. Silas stretched, breathing on his own hot carbon. His lungs felt thick. Soupy.\nThe monster caught him and pulled him gently inside.\nOnce the sphincter had resealed behind them and his radsuit gave a happy chirp, refilling its oxygen tanks from the bioship\u2019s atmosphere, Silas took his first breath. It swam his head and nearly splintered his ribs. He tried again, not so deep, and the vice squeezing his vision black slowly loosened. He could see the bioluminescence spackling the dark ceiling like constellations.\nHe could see the monster standing over him, upright now on two thick stumps of legs, and could see, despite it being the same rubbery brown flesh as the rest of the bioship, that there was something very human about it. Silas rolled onto his stomach, tested his limbs, then got slowly, slowly, to his feet again.\nHe stared at the thing. The thing maybe stared back. Strips of flesh were peeling around its lumpy head and shoulders and the rubbery brown took on a gangrenous tinge around its stumpy feet. A decaying biosecurity module? No. Not with the way it was standing there, impatient, almost, waiting for Silas to decide on fight or flight.\nBile surged from his stomach. With clarion certainty he knew, suddenly, that Yorick was wrong. The bioship hadn\u2019t eaten the crew. Not all of them, at least.\n\u201cWere you a crew member?\u201d Silas asked faintly, external mic.\nThe thing nodded its lopsided head. Silas tamped down his urge to vomit. The bioship had to be equipped with some rudimentary gene labs, in case injured miners needed limbs regrown or a tweak for high-gravity work. He could picture the swath of tendrils conducting struggling crew members there one by one, fitting them into surgical pods, setting to work with mutagens and autoscalpels and artificial viruses. The bioship had played god and remade them in its image.\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d Silas said.\nThe thing nodded, this time gesturing with one arm.\n\u201cLead on,\u201d Silas said, and he fell into step behind it. He had passed through a different airlock: this corridor had less flesh and no waving tendrils. He checked on Haley\u2019s ghost again. It was still intact, still pristine, but before long the code would start to crumble around the edges. If he found Io and Yorick he might be able to rig something more stable using the processors in all three of their radsuits, but that was another temporary measure.\nAnd it assumed Io and Yorick were alive. Silas took another look at the thing\u2019s mottled hump and shuddered. \u201cThe two others with me,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you know where they are?\u201d\nHead shake, or at least Silas thought it was a head shake.\n\u201cCan I radio them?\u201d\nHead shake again.\n\u201cThe bioship will pick it up?\u201d\nA nod, at last. But maybe Io and Yorick had gotten away and holed up somewhere on the bioship. He\u2019d distracted it quite thoroughly, after all, when he took off sprinting. Silas held that comforting thought in mind as they arrived at what Silas guessed was the engine room.\nThe cold alloy door shuttered open at a touch, with a refreshing rasp of metal on metal, and they stepped inside. Silas had guessed right; the room was dominated by a shielded reactor and mountainous banks of monitoring equipment. Pustules of brown flesh still grew from cracks here and there, but for the most part it was a sanctuary of geometric surfaces and hard edges. Clean, cold, solid.\nThe door hissed shut behind them, and the noise turned Silas\u2019 head just in time to see his newfound companion\u2019s death throes. He gave a shocked howl and jumped back as the thing dug deep at its rotting tissue, pulling it away in strips and clumps. Spongy flesh shredded and tumbled to the floor.\n\u201cAre you molting?\u201d Silas asked, dumbfounded.\n\u201cYou talk too much.\u201d\nSilas nearly swallowed his tongue whole. The voice was heavily accented, something Outer Colonies, hoarse from disuse, but it was human and it matched the bone-gaunt woman now clambering out of the steaming mess of meat. She was tall, spindly almost, with dark hair cropped to stubble around a wide-mouthed face. Her eyes were hard black graphite.\n\u201cI\u2019m Cena,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019m a ghost. Formerly . . . A mining tech.\u201d She gave a ragged laugh with no light left in it.\n\u201cSilas,\u201d Silas said. \u201cFailed virtuoso, freethinker technician.\u201d\nCena picked a wriggling bit of biomass off her shoulder and flicked it to the floor. She said nothing.\n\u201cWhat the fuck happened here?\u201d Silas demanded, slumping to a crouch. He\u2019d meant to ask it gruffly, like some kind of amped-up cybersoldier, but his voice broke in two and it sounded how he felt. Desperate.\n\u201cLove,\u201d Cena said.\n\u201cLove.\u201d\nShe nodded, lips pursed, and Silas imagined he could cut his finger on her cheekbones.\n\u201cYou\u2019re post-traumatic crazy.\u201d He put his head in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s great. That\u2019s really swank.\u201d Haley\u2019s neural patterns would start eroding in another hour. Silas watched the time display pulse accusingly in the corner of his vision.\n\u201cI thought I would do this forever,\u201d Cena said, breaking him from his thoughts. There was a sudden upshift in her speech. \u201cI thought I would just do this forever. I thought I would eat the ship and shit the ship and wear the ship until one day I woke up grafted to the wall like Ahmed and Slick Jack and Omir and Su and all the others.\u201d She took a deep trembling breath. Released it. \u201cBut now I\u2019m talking to a failed virtuoso named Silo.\u201d\n\u201cSilas.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Cena shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened. Just promise me you\u2019re real.\u201d\nSilas promised. Cena told him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been signed to Dronyck Orbital for six years, now. No. Seven. First long haul on a bioship, though. She\u2019s called the Anastasia. We launched with a twelve-person crew, heading to one of the alloy belts. Solid crew. I\u2019d shipped out with most of them before. The babysitter was new.\u201d\nSilas felt a heart pang. Dronyk hadn\u2019t allocated them a babysitter to pop in and out of cryo during the six month long haul, keep the freethinker company and check in on the sleepers. Maybe a babysitter would have spotted Haley\u2019s damaged equipment.\n\u201cHis name was Pierce. Twitchy little man. Head full of ports and data stacks like a porcupine. I think it was his first long haul.\u201d Cena folded her arms in the Lazarus position, the universal sign for cryo. \u201cSo eleven of us went to sleep. Pierce stayed awake for the first week, to check the pods, calibrate the freethinker. Then he was supposed to join us until the first scheduled thaw. But he didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t.\u201d She shook her stubbled head. \u201cNot until we thawed six months in for full physical. Pierce was waiting for us, very happy, very twitchy. Said we\u2019d found something better than a nickel vein. Said the ship\u2019s freethinker had crossed the Turing Line.\u201d\n\u201cFully sapient?\u201d Silas demanded. \u201cThe Anastasia\u2019s fully sapient?\u201d He lowered his voice, as if the freethinker might hear her name like a gossiper across a crowded party. Fewer than a dozen AIs in the known universe were confirmed to have crossed the Turing Line. Their innumerable brethren were only self-aware in the most basic sense.\nCena shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what he said. That was his excuse for staying warm for six straight months and burning through the food and water.\u201d\n\u201cBut a mining ship freethinker?\u201d Silas was still stuck on the previous revelation. \u201cNo way could it go sapient. Not nearly enough codespace. AIs cross the Turing Line in mega labs, not on a rig financed by Dronyck fucking Orbital.\u201d\n\u201cHe explained that, too,\u201d Cena said wearily. \u201cA metal ship, no. But a bioship, yes. The freethinker was already tapped into a crude nervous system. And at some point she started growing gray matter. Hardware to wetware processing.\u201d Cena encompassed the bioship with a wave of her arm. \u201cShe has all the codespace she needs, now.\u201d\nSilas rocked back on his haunches. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t even a freethinker running a ship anymore. They really are one big borg.\u201d\n\u201cPierce called it evolution.\u201d Cena laughed again, the same ugly sound. \u201cHe had been talking to her for six straight months. Docked in, you know. He was losing his fucking mind.\u201d\nSilas felt like he was losing his. He could picture pulsating flesh all around him, but now peeled back, exposing the filigree of neurons, sodium and crackling potassium, neurons swimming up and down a vast lattice of canals. As much space as any mega lab. Enough space for a self-aware sapient intelligence.\n\u201cHe used up all the food,\u201d Cena said. \u201cFeeding her. He hacked into all the supply rooms. We still had the hydroponic garden, but he\u2019d stripped most of that, too. And we were still six months out from the alloy belt. Omir and Slick Jack wanted to feed him to the ship.\u201d She paused, then gave a sickly grin. \u201cHe beat them to it. We had him locked in a store room until we figured out what to do. Argued all nightcycle. And when we went to get him in the morning, he was gone.\u201d Cena\u2019s black eyes seemed to glitter. \u201cAnastasia let him out. Stupid of us not to have someone watching him. But we were upset. Scared. We checked the cams. They weren\u2019t wiped. We saw Pierce sneak out. He went to the equipment hold first, to get a gnasher.\u201d\n\u201cGnasher?\u201d\n\u201cCutting tool. Uses superheated plasma.\u201d\nSilas thought of the sharp glinting shapes they\u2019d passed in the dark, the rotary saws and line cutters. He was not enjoying this story. His skin was crawling with it.\n\u201cAnd then.\u201d Cena paused, frowning, her tongue sliding along her yellow teeth as she shook off Silas\u2019 interruption. \u201cAnd then, after he had the gnasher, he went and set it up by a cluster of nutrient tubes. Anastasia sealed off the corridor, I think, so we wouldn\u2019t hear it. He cut off his legs.\u201d\nHe\u2019d known it was coming, in the back of his mind, but Silas still flinched.\n\u201cThe stumps cauterized clean, and I think he must have shut off his pain, or something, with one of those stacks in his skull,\u201d Cena mused. \u201cOtherwise I don\u2019t see how he could have managed to get the second one off. He shoved them into a nutrient tube. Did his right arm, after, wriggling around on the floor like a worm. Shoved the arm in. Then it was just him. Inching. Got in headfirst, but by the way his stumps were twitching, I don\u2019t think he was dead for at least a half hour. Anastasia took him nice and slow.\u201d\nSilas hit the release on his hood and gave up a thin, bubbly vomit his stomach had somehow managed to churn together.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Cena said, as it spattered the floor. \u201cAnastasia can clean that up, too.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the fuck would he do that?\u201d Silas rasped, once he\u2019d resealed his hood. The bioship\u2019s atmosphere was obviously breathable, but with a dank rotting taste. He would take recycled any day. \u201cDid she get into his implants, somehow?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid she puppet him?\u201d\n\u201cIt was voluntary. Judging by the audios he left for us.\u201d Cena grimaced. \u201cHe was in love with it. In love with her. He was docked in every day for six months, but you\u2019re a technician. You know how time perception gets. For him, it could have been years. Decades. He wanted to be with her forever. Full upload, he called it. Sick fucker had a prong the whole time he was cutting himself up. Didn\u2019t go flaccid until Anastasia ate his spinal cord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\n\u201cWe were scared. Made a course deviation to get into orbit here, sent out emergency frequencies. Figured we might be able to get the bioship to go dormant until some trained technicians could come in and wipe the freethinker.\u201d Cena shook her head. \u201cAnd once we were in orbit here, no food, minimal water, no way of knowing when help would arrive, the only thing we could do was go back into cryo.\u201d Cena wiped at her emaciated cheeks and seemed disappointed to find them dry. \u201cWe thought Pierce was the crazy one,\u201d she enunciated, staring at her fingertips. \u201cWe thought Anastasia was still obeying her programming, sapient or no. So it should have been safe. To go back into cryo. It was the only thing we could do.\u201d\nShe stalled out, so Silas prodded. \u201cThe pods were empty when we came in.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Cena stared at him. \u201cI woke up twenty-one days ago. Wasn\u2019t supposed to. Some kind of glitch. And the other pods, yeah. Empty.\u201d She snarled. \u201cShe was heating us up one by one like fucking sausages. I didn\u2019t understand what had happened at first. You know how your head gets right after the thaw. Thought I was hallucinating. Especially when I found half of Ahmed.\u201d\n\u201cHalf.\u201d\n\u201cTop half. Grafted to the corridor wall. Being . . . Absorbed.\u201d Cena\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t talk anymore, at that point. I don\u2019t think. She already broke something in his brain. He just stared at me. Then, when I tried to pull him down, he screamed. Loud, so loud. Anastasia must have heard it, or felt it, because she started sprouting those tentacles.\u201d\nSilas remembered the feel of them coiling around his ankles and shuddered.\n\u201cI screamed, too,\u201d Cena said. \u201cSo loud. I know I should have stayed. I should have bashed his skull in with my boot. I think I could have done it quickly. Quicker. But I ran.\u201d\nIo and Yorick, left alone with no howler to face the bioship\u2019s army of spiked tendrils. Silas\u2019 stomach turned again at the thought of them writhing on a wall.\n\u201cI hid here, in engineering. Anastasia doesn\u2019t have so much body down here. I tried getting into the system for days and days, but she shut me out of everything. Couldn\u2019t flush a fucking waste unit, much less launch the lifeboat.\u201d Cena gestured towards the blinking control panels. \u201cShe\u2019s been hunting me for three weeks. Can\u2019t see me when I wear her own skin, though, and when she goes dormant I burn out sensors and nerve bundles wherever I can find them.\u201d She pointed to the mass of flesh she\u2019d shed and it wriggled sluggishly. \u201cFound out that if you slice it and mold it, it grows back together. Useful. Can even eat it when you\u2019re done.\u201d\nSilas couldn\u2019t hide his disgust and Cena spotted it.\n\u201cI always wonder who it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAhmed or Omir or Su or whoever. I\u2019m eating the crew. Just like she did. Maybe I\u2019ll eat you, too.\u201d\nSilas stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m stringy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m joking. So. I\u2019ve been waiting. Waiting and waiting.\u201d Cena rubbed her cheek again. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re here. I can barely work a healthy freethinker. But I know that if we wipe the personality module, Anastasia dies. Or at least reboots.\u201d\nSilas remembered the swollen module, spitting and swirling with corrupt code. Beyond repair. But there was an alternative to wiping it blank.\n\u201cIf she\u2019s distracted, will you be able to get into the system?\u201d Cena grabbed his arm with cold fingers, eager.\n\u201cI almost got in before.\u201d Silas gently tugged his arm away. \u201cBut that was, you know, before. She\u2019ll be ready for intrusion now. Her main interface nearly electrocuted me on the way out.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be busy,\u201d Cena said. She looked down at her hands. \u201cWith your friends.\u201d\nSilas snapped upright. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t know where they were.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI got away,\u201d Silas said, raking both hands over his head. \u201cThey got away. Holed up somewhere how you did.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Cena said. She gave him a long look. \u201cWhether Anastasia has them or not, the only way to help your friends is to shut her down. Agreed?\u201d\nSilas inhaled deep enough that his oxygen meter blinked. \u201cAgreed,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s fucking wipe this thing out.\u201d He stuck out his hand and Cena clung to it like a vice, grinning fierce and mad.\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood. I\u2019ll make you a suit.\u201d\nA half hour later, Silas was creeping through a maintenance corridor, swathed from head to foot in what felt like rotting mushroom. The flesh suit was slick and warm and constricted his chest and arms, but he could move. Through a ragged gap he\u2019d never noticed on Cena\u2019s hump, he could more or less see.\nAnd the tendrils hanging from the ceiling couldn\u2019t. They brushed against him every so often, first trailing along Cena\u2019s back and then bumping his, but they made no move to coil or strike. As far as the feelers were concerned, Silas was already part of the bioship.\nSo, he figured using the radio was worth the risk. Making sure Cena was still trundling forward, and that his external speaker was off, Silas chinned his mic. There was a static crackle, then nothing for a long minute. Silas clenched his jaw. He could picture Io\u2019s top half without the bottom. Yorick crucified to a nutrient tube, unable to speak. Not even the company man deserved that.\n\u201cSilas! You alive?\u201d\nHe\u2019d never been so glad to hear Io\u2019s voice. \u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d he said, clenching his fists inside their fleshy mitts. Relief crashed over him in warm waves. \u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd I got Haley\u2019s ghost. Are you alright? Are both of you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re alright, you stupid fuck.\u201d Io\u2019s reply was half-laughed. \u201cYou lobotomy case. You idiot.\u201d She exhaled static. \u201cHow did you get back aboard? Fuck, Silas, our ship\u2019s gone. Gone.\u201d\n\u201cI know. Where are you?\u201d Silas demanded, still picking his way along in Cena\u2019s wake. \u201cActually, wait, don\u2019t say. Anastasia might be listening. The freethinker.\u201d\n\u201cYou named her?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s her name,\u201d Silas protested. \u201cLook, I found out what happened with the crew, and it\u2019s fucked up. It\u2019s seriously fucked up.\u201d\n\u201cWe found out, too,\u201d Io said. Her voice sounded strained. \u201cAnd yeah. It is. But we don\u2019t have to end up like them. We\u2019ve been . . . Negotiating. With her.\u201d\nSilas felt a prickle down the nape of his neck. \u201cBad idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBad, bad idea. She\u2019s completely bat-shit.\u201d\n\u201cI know that.\u201d Io paused. \u201cLook, she has the lifeboat prepped and ready to launch. She doesn\u2019t want us. Says we\u2019re not family, whatever the fuck that means. But she wants us to do something for her first. She wants us to make her whole.\u201d\nSilas stared ahead at Cena\u2019s swaying back. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked, feeling another stab of trepidation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last crew member.\u201d Io\u2019s voice was coarse now. \u201cThey got away. She wants the whole set. She wants us to help hunt them down and recycle them.\u201d\nCena turned to urge him on, and Silas realized his steps had slowed. He gave an affirming wave. She turned back. The ribbed corridor was coming to an end. They were nearly to the bridge.\n\u201cThis was supposed to be a rescue mission,\u201d Silas said.\n\u201cIt was supposed to be maintenance,\u201d Io said flatly. \u201cWe weren\u2019t advised of these risks. Yorick will spin it our way when we get back to Dronyk.\u201d\nSilas weighed it. Part of him wanted nothing more than to get off the Anastasia by any means necessary, get far away from this nightmare circus of meat and mad AIs. A lifeboat beeline for Pentecost was tempting.\nBut even on full burn, it would take another month to reach the planet. A lifeboat\u2019s freethinker was nowhere near equipped to hold a ghost. By the time they docked, Haley might be nothing but nonsense code and a jumble of decaying memories.\nAnd if they took the lifeboat, Cena would have to die for it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re with them right now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Io was silent for a long moment, waiting on the reply. \u201cSilas?\u201d\n\u201cShe saved my life,\u201d Silas finally said. \u201cPulled me back into the ship.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. \u201cYou have Haley\u2019s ghost, right?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Yeah, I have her.\u201d\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get out of here, and soon, she won\u2019t have a chance at recovery. You know that.\u201d\nThere was another chance at recovery, but Silas couldn\u2019t tell Io that. Not with Anastasia potentially listening in.\n\u201cSo where are you?\u201d Io pressed. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to the lower decks. Engineering. We going to find you there?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Silas lied. \u201cEngine room. Come in carefully. She has a, uh, a kind of plasma cutter.\u201d\n\u201cBe nice to have a fucking howler,\u201d Io said. \u201cAlright. Sit tight, stay away from the door. And don\u2019t tip her off.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Silas chinned his radio off. There was a cold slick of sweat on his shoulders that had nothing to do with the clammy flesh suit. Cena stood at the hatch, waiting. She set the gnasher down, then put her hands on either side of her misshapen head and twisted. It tore free with a rending noise that shivered Silas\u2019 teeth.\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, discarding the chunk of rubbery flesh, picking up her gnasher. \u201cYou ready?\u201d\nSilas keyed his external mic. \u201cYeah.\u201d He fingered the neural cord she\u2019d managed to find him, hoping all the conductors would still fire. \u201cReady.\u201d\nCena fixed him with a flint stare. \u201cWho were you talking to?\u201d\n\u201cMyself,\u201d Silas said. \u201cI talk too much. I may be losing my mind.\u201d\n\u201cAll mad here,\u201d Cena replied. She didn\u2019t look like she believed him, but she still turned and wrenched the maintenance hatch open.\nCena stormed out onto the bridge wailing like a banshee, raking the gnasher\u2019s beam in wild arcs, scorching trenches into the ceiling\u2019s overgrowth. Silas winced when she clipped a projector, leaving it black and smoking. He\u2019d told her not to slice up any circuitry.\n\u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Cena called. \u201cAnastasia! I\u2019m here! No more hiding, no more sneaking. Eat me!\u201d\nEven as she screamed it, the bioship responded to the intrusion, oozing clear mucus into the sizzling furrows while tentacles snapped from the floors and walls. They converged on her like vipers, baring hooks and barbs, and Cena cut down the first crop. A straggler darted under the beam and wrapped around her foot. She stomped, swore, fumbled with her makeshift weapon.\nSilas was so caught up he nearly forgot why he was there. Then Haley\u2019s ghost pinged through his radsuit\u2019s processor, and he located the soft blue glow of the ship\u2019s main interface. The few tentacles dangling overtop of it strained in the direction of the fracas, distracted. Anastasia\u2019s full attentions were on Cena and her gnasher. Silas reminded himself he was invisible, took a steadying breath, and ambled out of the maintenance hatch.\nIt only took moments to traverse the length of the bridge, but it seemed like a hard eternity. Silas walked slowly, eyes fixed ahead. Cena shouted and shot down wave after wave of roiling tentacles. The hot orange flash of the gnasher swam purple blots across Silas\u2019 vision. The noise of searing meat and Cena cackling was loud, loud in his head. He walked through the chaos, untouched, and finally found himself standing where things first went to shit, right in front of the innocent blue interface.\nHe chanced a look up to the two tentacles overhead, straining towards the fray like overeager watch dogs. Then he dug his hands through the stumps of his flesh suit and hooked the neural cord into the interface\u2019s port. Overhead, the tentacles shifted. Silas removed his lumpy head next, freeing up the concordant port on the neck of his radsuit. With one last look back at Cena trying to coax dregs from the gnasher\u2019s battery, Silas jammed the neural cord into his neck and closed the circuit.\nIn. Silas sliced through virtual space, wriggling through the now-active detection system, throwing up a blizzard of nonsense code that masked his passage through the core files. The personality module loomed, hulking, throbbing. Larger and more complex than any freethinker Silas had ever cracked, a writhing mass of electric thought. But he didn\u2019t have to crack it. All he had to do was replace it.\nSilas pulled Haley\u2019s neural imprint from the flagging processor in his radsuit and pushed it across the channel. She streamed into the personality module as a digital flood, seeping into the cracks, coursing through the nodes. Code danced and jittered as it rewrote itself. Silas prayed hard to any god.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing, Silas?\u201d\nHe realized Io\u2019s voice was not coming through his radio at the same instant he recognized the shape of a thumb pressed up to his neck.\n\u201cFixing the freethinker,\u201d Silas said, but even as he said it he felt his connection guillotine. He blinked, nerves tingling, back in the real world. Io was standing behind him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s beyond fixing. Said it yourself.\u201d Io pulled him away from the interface, making the unhooked neural cord swing. \u201cDronyk didn\u2019t see this coming. It\u2019s not our shit to deal with.\u201d\nSilas realized he couldn\u2019t hear Cena cursing. He turned and wished he hadn\u2019t. The dead gnasher was lying on the floor, and Cena\u2019s limp body was being hoisted up the wall. A thick pale nutrient tube had appeared there, cilia waving in anticipation as the tentacles dragged her upward.\n\u201cYou may leave now.\u201d Anastasia\u2019s voice blared through Silas\u2019 head. \u201cYour lifeboat is fueled.\u201d\nSilas\u2019 heart stopped. It hadn\u2019t worked. The transfer hadn\u2019t worked. He\u2019d dashed Haley\u2019s ghost against the virtual rocks, or worse, she was trapped in some tiny corner of the freethinker\u2019s personality module.\n\u201cCome on, Silas,\u201d Io said shakily. \u201cWe have to get the fuck out of here.\u201d\nYorick was silent, ash-white, uglier than Silas had ever seen him. He would get no support there.\n\u201cHaley,\u201d Silas pleaded. \u201cHaley, can you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll upload her to the lifeboat.\u201d Io swallowed. \u201cEven with the decay, you\u2019ll at least have some of her. Some memories. That\u2019s better than nothing.\u201d\nSilas shook his head, unable to explain. Cena inched up the wall. Her eyes were glazed over.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Io said. \u201cLet\u2019s live.\u201d\nSilas looked away before Cena reached the nutrient tube. He\u2019d killed her, too. He should stay. He should stay and be the next one on the wall. But when Io grabbed him by the arm, he stumbled after her, tears tracking down his cheeks. Tentacles twitched as they passed.\nThen, all at once, they went limp.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Silas rasped. \u201cWait. Do you hear that?\u201d\nThe melody he\u2019d been composing for the past three days trembled in the air, haunting and sweet, growing slowly louder as it looped. Io\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cSilas?\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t Io who said his name. The synthesized voice wavered through the bridge, unfamiliar and familiar at the same time.\n\u201cHaley.\u201d Silas\u2019 throat constricted. \u201cThis isn\u2019t how I meant for you to wake up.\u201d\nThere was a dull thump that made him jump. Cena\u2019s unconscious form slumped to the floor, released by the tentacles. Silas staggered over to her body and checked for breath on his hand. Io and Yorick were still frozen to the spot, staring around.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only one in here,\u201d Haley\u2019s voice said. \u201cThere are others. A lot of them. Why am I in here, Silas? What happened?\u201d\nSilas thought of the nodes of gray matter all through the bioship, all connected, all wired through the Anastasia\u2019s freethinker. Make her whole, she\u2019d said. The crew wasn\u2019t dead. Not quite.\n\u201cYou\u2019re in a bioship,\u201d Silas said. \u201cYou\u2019re the new freethinker.\u201d He paused. \u201cBecause you died in cryo.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d A tremor ran through the bioship. \u201cTell me from the start. All of it.\u201d\nSilas collected himself. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s sort of a fucked up story.\u201d\nRich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

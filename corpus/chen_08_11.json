The fist flips, opens. Empty.\nThe fists disappear and reappear.\n\u201cOne more chance. Left or right?\u201d\nI point to the one on the right.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure? Want to change your mind?\u201d\nMy finger hesitates in the air, waving left, then right, like a swimming fish.\n\u201cFinal answer? Three . . . two . . . one.\u201d\nMy finger stops on the left.\nThe fist flips, opens. Other than the bright sunlight, the hand is empty.\nA dream?\nI open my eyes. The sun is bright, white, and hurts my eyes. I\u2019ve been dozing in this Naxi-style courtyard for who knows how long. I haven\u2019t felt this comfortable in such a long time. The sky is so fucking blue. I stretch until my bones crack.\nAfter ten years, everything here has changed. The only thing that remains the same is the color of the sky.\nLijiang, I\u2019m back. This time, I\u2019m a sick man.\nTwenty-four hours ago, I had a multiplicity of identities: an office drone with a strict routine, the master of a gray Ford, the prospective owner of a moldy apartment tucked into a hidden fold of the city, a debt-ridden parasite, etc.\nNow, I\u2019m just a patient, a patient in need of rehabilitation.\nIt\u2019s the fault of that damned mandatory physical exam. On the last page of the report were the words: PNFD II (Psychogenic Neural-Functional Disorder II). Translated into words normal people can understand, they say that I\u2019m messed up and I must take two weeks off to rehabilitate.\nMy face flushed, I asked my boss whether I could be exempted. I felt the stares of everyone in the office burning into the back of my neck. Schadenfreude. They were delighted that the \u201cboss\u2019s pet\u201d was shown to be human after all, weak in the head, collapsing under the stress.\nI shuddered. That\u2019s office politics for you.\nThe boss spoke slowly, methodically: \u201cYou think I want this? I have to pay for your mandatory vacation! People working at other companies can\u2019t even get rehab even if they need it. But the new labor law requires it of us. Our company is a proper, globalized business; we have to set an example . . . Anyway, if you get worse, your disease will turn into neurosyphilis and infect the rest of us. Better that you leave now, yes?\u201d\nAshamed, I left the boss\u2019s office and cleaned out my desk. I ignored the stares. Keep on looking, you neurosyphilitic assholes. I\u2019ll be back in two weeks and we\u2019ll see who gets to be assistant manager at the end of the year.\nOn the airplane, I listened to the snores around me, unable to fall asleep. I\u2019ve been dealing with insomnia for more than a month. Actually, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of things: upset stomach, forgetfulness, headaches, fatigue, depression, loss of libido . . . maybe it really was time for me to rest for a while.\nI flipped through the in-flight magazine: the pictures of the tourist sights around Lijiang were so beautiful they almost seemed fake.\nTen years ago, I had nothing and no care. Ten years ago, Lijiang was a paradise for those who liked to exile themselves from civilization. (Or, to put it less pretentiously, that was where young people who fancied themselves \u201cartists\u201d slept with each other.) Ten years ago, I carried everything I owned on my back (still had some muscles then). A map of the ancient city in my pocket, I wandered through it from morning till midnight, chatted with every woman who was alone, fell asleep to the accompaniment of song and alcohol.\nNow I\u2019m back. I have a car, a house\u2014everything a man should have, including erectile dysfunction and insomnia. If happiness and time are the two axes of a graph, then I\u2019m afraid that the curve of my life has already passed the apex and is on its inexorable way down to the bottom.\nI stay still, thinking of nothing. Sunlight falls from the top of the high walls into the yard, which smells of Chinese mahogany. I don\u2019t know how much time has passed. My watch, mobile, and any other gadget capable of displaying time have been taken away by the staff of the rehabilitation center.\nThe ancient city has no computers and no TV. But some of the inhabitants have decided to rent out the space on their foreheads and chests. Tiny LCDs are embedded into their skin, showing all kinds of ads, twenty-four hours a day. Like I said, this is no longer the Lijiang I knew.\nStrangely, my desire to get better as soon as possible so that I can get back to the office is fading in the sunlight, like the fading smell of the Chinese mahogany.\nMy stomach growls, once. I decide to go find something to eat. My stomach seems the only way I have left to tell time\u2014oh, there\u2019s also my bladder and the shifting lights in the sky.\nThe slate-lined street has few pedestrians\u2014this part of the city is reserved for the use of the rehabilitating patients. There are many stray dogs, however: fat, thin, all kinds.\nOn the flight here I heard a joke. Serious economic criminals, in addition to the death penalty and life imprisonment, can now be sentenced to a third kind of punishment: become experimental subjects for consciousness transfer operations in Lijiang so that they can be turned into dogs. Normally, because these experiments often fail, no one volunteers. But the idea of living in Lijiang is so attractive\u2014even as a dog\u2014many have jumped at the opportunity.\nSeeing how these dogs are so obsequious before pretty girls and so nervous before city inspectors, I almost think the joke is reportage.\nI finish a bowl of soy chicken, find a caf\u00e9, and sit with a cup of black coffee. I flip through a few books I\u2019ve always been meaning to read (and will never finish) and think about \u201cthe meaning of life.\u201d\nIs this how you get better? Without any physical therapy, medication, special diet, yoga, yin-yang dynamics, or any other kind of professional care? Is this the meaning of the slogan plastered all over the rehabilitation center: \u201cHealthy Minds, Happy Bodies\u201d?\nI have to admit it: I have a great appetite; I\u2019m sleeping well; I\u2019m relaxed; I feel better even than I did ten years ago.\nEven my nose, which has been stuffed up for several weeks, can now pick out the fragrance of sachets in a coffee shop. Wait. Sachets?\nI lift my head. A girl in a dark green dress is sitting across from me, holding a drink that smells delicious and looking at me with a big smile on her face. This is like the hook for some French film, I think, or maybe a dream, either sweet or terrifying.\n\u201cSo you\u2019re in marketing?\u201d\nThe woman and I are walking together in the light of the setting sun. The stone-paved street is bathed in a golden glow. Lovely smells waft from the snack bars.\n\u201cSure. You can also say I\u2019m in sales. How about you? Office lady? Civil service? Police? Teacher?\u201d Then I add a bit of flattery. \u201cActress?\u201d\n\u201cHa! Keep on guessing.\u201d She seems to enjoy my attempt at humor. \u201cI\u2019m a special care nurse. Surprised?\u201d\n\u201cSo even nurses can get sick and need rehab.\u201d\nAfter dinner, we go to a bar. She\u2019s disappointed by the decline in the level of service at Lijiang. \u201cWhat happened to all the fun people who used to run this place?\u201d\nFrom one of the waiters we find out that the place is now owned by Lijiang Industries (stock code # 203845), backed by several wealthy conglomerates. The local owners she knew sold because they either could no longer afford to keep the place running or could not afford a new license. Everything is so much more expensive now. But the stock of Lijiang Industries is doing very well.\nThe ancient city at night is filled with the spirit of consumerism, but we can\u2019t find anywhere we want to go. She has no interest in hearing Naxi folk music played by a robot orchestra\u2014\u201cSounds like a braying donkey with its balls cut off.\u201d I don\u2019t want to see a folk dance demonstration by a bonfire\u2014\u201cLike a human BBQ.\u201d In the end we decide to lie down on our bellies by the side of the street, watching the little fish swimming in the waterway.\nIn the waterways of Lijiang live schools of red fish. Whether it\u2019s dawn, dusk, or midnight, you can see them hovering in the water, facing the same direction, lined up like soldiers on a parade ground ready for inspection. But if you look closer, you\u2019ll see that they aren\u2019t really still. In fact, they\u2019re struggling against the current in order to maintain their position. Once in a while, one or two fish become tired and are pushed out of the formation by the current. But soon, tails fluttering, they struggle back into place.\nIt\u2019s been ten years since I last saw them. They, at least, haven\u2019t changed.\n\u201cSwim, swim, swim. Before you know it, life is over.\u201d I repeat the same words I said ten years ago.\n\u201cJust like us,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThis is the hidden meaning of life,\u201d I say. \u201cAt least we still can choose how to live.\u201d I sound so pretentious that I want to gag.\n\u201cBut the reality is that I didn\u2019t choose you, and you didn\u2019t choose me.\u201d\nMy heart skips a beat. I look at her. I really haven\u2019t thought about inviting her to come back to my hotel. I still don\u2019t feel the return of my libido. This is a misunderstanding.\nShe begins to laugh.\n\u201cI was quoting a song. You don\u2019t know it? Well, I\u2019m pretty beat. Why don\u2019t we meet up again tomorrow? You\u2019re fun.\u201d\n\u201cBut how do I find you . . . \u201d I suddenly realize that I don\u2019t have my mobile.\n\u201cI\u2019m staying here.\u201d She hands me the card from a hotel. \u201cIf you\u2019re too lazy to walk there, just get a dog.\u201d\n\u201cA dog?\u201d\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t know? Any stray dog would do. Take a piece of paper, write down the time and place you want to meet at and stick it in the dog\u2019s collar. Then swipe the hotel card through the collar.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to read your Lijiang guidebook.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how long I slept.\nI think it\u2019s the afternoon of the second day, but the position of the sun tells me it\u2019s morning. Except I have no way of ascertaining that it\u2019s not the morning of the third day, the fourth day, or a morning that comes after a dream that lasts a lifetime.\nMaybe that\u2019s the trick to full rehab: just don\u2019t dream about business reports and my boss\u2019s fat face.\nI look for a dog. But the dogs here have sharp noses. They can smell the failure on me and run away. I\u2019m forced to buy a packet of yak jerky. I feed a dog\u2014a real son of a bitch\u2014until it\u2019s stuffed. Finally I get him to carry my message.\nIn case she forgets who I am, I sign the note \u201cLast Night\u2019s Fish.\u201d\nI wander the streets. I enjoy the sun and the idleness. No one here has any sense of time anyway, so she can come whenever she wants to.\nI see an old man sitting in a corner with a falcon. The falcon and the man are both full of energy. I go up to them with my camera.\n\u201cNo pictures!\u201d the old man shouts.\n\u201cFive yuan! One dollar!\u201d the falcon shouts in a mixture of Sichuan-accented Mandarin and English.\nFuck! They\u2019re both robots. The city has nothing authentic any more. I turn around angrily.\n\u201cDo you want to know why the sky in Lijiang is so blue? Do you want to hear the legend of the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain?\u201d Seeing that I\u2019m about to go away, the old man changes his pitch and even his accent. Now he sounds like a man from urbane Suzhou. \u201cI know everything there is to know about Lijiang. One yuan only for each piece of information.\u201d\nWhy not? I just want to kill some time. Might as well hear his lies. I take out a coin and stick it into the falcon\u2019s beak. Clink! A panel opens in the falcon\u2019s chest, revealing a pink-glowing keypad.\n\u201cTo hear why the sky of Lijiang is so blue, press 1. To hear the Legend of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, press 2. . . . \u201d\nEnough. I press \u201c1.\u201d\n\u201cModern Lijiang relies on condensation control and scatter index standardization. The technology is able to maintain sunny days with probability above 95.426%. Through micro-adjustments to the atmospheric particle content, it is able to maintain the hue of the sky between Pantone2975c and 3035c. The system is designed by . . . \u201d\nDamn it. I feel sad. Even the sky, so beautiful it\u2019s like the pristine sky present at Creation, is fake.\n\u201cLooking for UFOs?\u201d she asks, as she puts her hands on my shoulders from behind.\n\u201cCan you tell me if anything here is real?\u201d I mutter.\n\u201cSure. There\u2019s you. There\u2019s me. We\u2019re real.\u201d\n\u201cReal sick,\u201d I correct her.\n\u201cTell me about yourself. I love getting to know someone.\u201d\nWe\u2019re now back in the bar. Through the window we can see the fish in the waterway below, swimming, swimming, going nowhere.\n\u201cLet\u2019s play a game,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take turns guessing facts about the other person. If the guess is right, the other person drinks. If the guess is wrong, the guesser drinks.\u201d\n\u201cSure. We\u2019ll see who gets drunk first.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll go first. You work for a big company, right?\u201d\n\u201cHa. My boss\u2019s favorite saying is: We\u2019re a proper, global, modern, big\u201d\u2014I lower my voice\u2014\u201cfactory.\u201d\nShe giggles.\nI can\u2019t remember if I told her anything about my company in the past. But I take a drink anyway.\n\u201cYour patients,\u201d I ask, \u201care all important people, right?\u201d She drinks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an important man at your company,\u201d she says. I drink.\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask something more interesting,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019ve had patients who made passes at you, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nShe blushes, and drains her glass.\n\u201cYou must have many girlfriends,\u201d she says. I hesitate for a second, and drink. \u201cHad\u201d is a form of \u201chave,\u201d I tell myself.\n\u201cYou are not married,\u201d I say.\nShe smiles, not answering.\nI shrug, taking a drink.\nOnly after I\u2019m done does she lift her glass and drink.\n\u201cNot fair! You tricked me.\u201d I say. But I\u2019m happy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s your own fault for being impatient.\u201d\n\u201cFine, then I\u2019m going to guess that you have insomnia, anxiety, arrhythmia, irregular periods . . . \u201d I know I\u2019ve been drinking too fast. I know I\u2019m going to regret this but I can\u2019t stop talking.\nShe glares at me, and drinks. Then she adds, \u201cWhatever symptoms you have, I don\u2019t. Whatever symptoms I have, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re both here, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cYou think nothing has meaning.\u201d\n\u201cThat was before I met you,\u201d I say, in what I think is a seductive tone. Now I\u2019m just shameless.\nShe ignores me. \u201cYou\u2019re often anxious, because you hate the feeling of the seconds slipping away from you. The world is changing every day. And every day you\u2019re getting older. But there are still so many things you haven\u2019t done. You want to hold onto the sand. But the harder you squeeze, the quicker the sand slips from the cracks between your fingers, until nothing is left . . . \u201d\nComing from anyone else, the words would just be pop psychology, pseudo intellectualism, cheap spirituality. But somehow, coming from her, they sound like the truth. Every word strikes against my heart, making me wince.\nI drink by myself in silence. Her smile begins to multiply: two, three, four of her . . . I want to ask her something, but my tongue is no longer obeying.\nShe looks embarrassed. She whispers to me, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk. I\u2019ll take you back.\u201d\nSo, I\u2019ve failed again.\nIt takes a long time for me to remember where I am.\nDuring the time I\u2019m thinking, the sun shifts through six window squares. The sun marches across three more window squares before I\u2019ve washed away the smell of alcohol on my body and the vomit in the bathroom.\nI guess Miss Nurse hasn\u2019t taken good care of this patient. I have a splitting headache.\nI don\u2019t want to send a dog after her. Indeed, I\u2019m a bit scared to meet her. Maybe she\u2019s a telepath? It makes sense to have a telepath as a special care nurse, right? Especially if a patient can no longer speak.\nThe biggest fear is for someone else to understand what you really fear.\nA Shar-Pei enters my room and barks at me. I take out the slip of paper tucked into its collar.\nShe wants me to go with her to listen to robots playing Naxi folk music, which she described to me as a donkey braying with its balls cut off. She signed her note \u201cI\u2019m No Telepath.\u201d\nScrew you! You bourgeois bitch! I kick the Shar-Pai. It whimpers.\nIn the end, curiosity overcomes fear. I wash, get dressed, go to the concert hall. She\u2019s dressed all in yellow. I nod at her.\nBut she ignores my attempt to remain distant. She walks right up to me, takes my hand in hers, and drags me inside.\n\u201cStop pretending,\u201d she whispers in my ear. I have to struggle to keep from her how aroused I am.\nThey begin to play. It does sound like a donkey braying. It\u2019s an insult to real Naxi music, the sort I heard ten years ago.\nThe robots swing back and forth, pretending to play all sorts of Naxi instruments, and recorded music streams from speakers embedded into the seats. The robots are clearly made in China: stiff, ridiculous movements, limited repertoire of gestures, monotonous expressions. Only robot Xuan Ke is made with any kind of care for detail. Once in a while he even acts as though he\u2019s completely absorbed by his performance. I worry that he\u2019ll swing so hard that his head is going to fall off.\n\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like donkey-braying,\u201d I whisper into her ear. The fragrance of sachets surrounds me.\n\u201cThis is one part of our rehabilitation.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\nI try to kiss her. But she dodges out of the way and my lips meet her fingers.\n\u201cBack in your office, on your desk, there\u2019s a tiny grey alarm clock. It\u2019s shaped like a mushroom, and it often runs fast.\u201d\nHer tone is calm, but I\u2019m stupefied. That clock was a gift from the company when I won employee of the month. How does she know about it?\nI lost the drinking game\u2014maybe that was an accident. But this . . .\nI continue to stare at her profile. The donkey-braying music washes over me like a tidal wave. I seem to have also become a robot musician. I strain to play my foolish song of seduction, but she sees through me with no effort. I have nothing in my chest but a mechanical heart made of iron.\nWe end up in bed together.\nShe acts as though this is nothing special. But not me. A man is such a strange animal: fear and desire are expressed by the same organ. For the former, he loses control of the organ and it lets out urine; for the latter, he loses control of the organ and it fills with blood.\nIs this part of our rehab too? I can imagine myself mocking her. But I don\u2019t, because I fear how she\u2019ll answer.\n\u201cWho are you really?\u201d I can\u2019t help myself.\nHer voice is muffled, indistinct.\n\u201cI\u2019m a nurse. My patient is time.\u201d\nIn the end she does tell me her story.\nShe works for a place called \u201cTime Care Unit.\u201d Only the most important men of the business world get to go there.\nThe old men are like mummies, their bodies plugged full of tubes and wires. Twenty-four hours a day they must be watched and cared for. Every day, all kinds of people come to visit. They dress in sterile biosuits and stand around the beds, communing with the old men, reporting and receiving instructions in silence.\nThe old men never move. Each of their breaths takes hours. Once in a while, one of them moans like a baby, and someone makes a record of it. Looking at all the biological signs, they should all be considered dead. The numbers shown on their machines never change. But they remain in that place for years, decades.\nShe tells me that they are receiving \u201ctime sense dilation therapy.\u201d She calls them \u201cthe living dead.\u201d\nThe therapy began some twenty years ago. Back then, scientists discovered that by controlling the biological clock of an organism, it was possible to reduce the production of free radicals and slow down aging. But the decay of the mind and its eventual death could not be reversed or halted.\nSomeone made another discovery: the aging of the mind was intimately connected with the sense of the passage of time. By manipulating certain receptors in the pineal gland, it was possible to slow down one\u2019s sense of time, to dilate it. The body of a person receiving time sense dilation therapy remains in the normal stream of time, but his mind experiences time a hundred, a thousand times slower than the rest of us.\n\u201cBut what does this have to do with you?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYou know that women who live together synchronize their biological rhythms, like menstrual cycles?\u201d\nI nod.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with us nurses who care for these living dead, day in, day out. Once a year, I have to come to Lijiang to rehabilitate, to remove the effects time dilation has on my body.\u201d\nI feel dizzy. Time sense dilation is used on those old men because of the need to maintain stock prices or to delay power struggles among successors. But what if the dilation is applied to a normal person? I try to imagine experiencing a hundred years within a second. But my imagination is not up to the task. To extend time to near infinity is to slow it down until it\u2019s almost still. Then isn\u2019t the mind under such dilation immortal? What\u2019s the need for a body made of flesh?\n\u201cRemember what I told you? I didn\u2019t choose you, and you didn\u2019t choose me,\u201d she says, smiling almost apologetically.\nI begin to feel anxiety again, as though my fingers are wrapped around a handful of sand, leaking sand.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the other half of me, cloven by Zeus\u2019s thunderbolt.\u201d\nThe words sound to me like a curse.\nShe\u2019s leaving.\nShe tells me that her rehabilitation period is up.\nWe sit in the dark. In front of us is the imposing mass of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, its snowy peaks reflecting the silver moonlight. Neither of us speaks.\nThe donkey-braying music loops again and again in my head.\n\u201cRemember that alarm clock on your desk?\u201d\nAlthough time sense dilation therapy is very expensive, the opposite procedure\u2014time sense compression\u2014is not. The procedure is cheap enough to be commercialized. Several large conglomerates have invested in it, and taking advantage of certain loopholes in China\u2019s labor laws (and the complicity of the government), they\u2019ve been conducting secret trials on Chinese employees of international companies.\nThat alarm clock is a prototype time sense compressor.\n\u201cSo we are all lab mice,\u201d I remember mocking myself at her revelation. Even my boss is a mouse\u2014he also has one of those clocks on his desk.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you know the truth,\u201d she says. \u201cThe theoretical basis for time sense compression does not exist.\u201d\n\u201cDoes not exist?\u201d\n\u201cTheoretical physics says it\u2019s impossible, so they had to base it on the philosophy of Henri Bergson. It\u2019s all about intuition.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She laughs. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s all nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that my disease, this PNFD II or whatever it\u2019s called, is the result of time sense compression?\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t say anything.\nBut it makes sense. Time passes quicker in my mind than it does in the real world. Every day I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m always working overtime. I accomplish so much more in twenty-four hours than others. No wonder the company thinks I\u2019m a model employee.\nClouds drift over and hide the moon, eliminating the reflected light on the snowy peaks. Everything grows darker like after they lower the lights in a theatre.\nA bright red laser beam lands on the snowy cliffs\u20145600 meters above the sea\u2014now acting as a giant screen. The laser creates shifting patterns, telling an animated tale, the creation of the world. A myth has been bowdlerized to mass entertainment. I\u2019m not in the mood to appreciate it. The dancing lights only make my heart beat irregularly.\nTime sense compression is wonderful for improving productivity and GDP. But there are many side effects. The mismatch between subjective time and physical time causes metabolic problems that accumulate into severe symptoms.\nThe conglomerates that invested in the technology created the rehabilitation centers in China and lobbied to change the labor laws to institutionalize the idea of \u201crehabilitation\u201d so as to hide the truth.\nThey discovered that those suffering from the side effects of time sense dilation and those suffering from the side effects of time sense compression can help each other, be each other\u2019s cure.\n\u201cI\u2019m the yang to your yin, is that it?\u201d So her interest in me is limited to my value as a medical device. My middle-aged male ego is hurt.\n\u201cSure, if you insist on thinking about it that way.\u201d Her tone, at least, is compassionate.\n\u201cWhat about the donkey-braying music?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to harmonize our biorhythms.\u201d\nI wait for her to stroke my ego by telling me that compared to her previous rehabilitation biorhythm partners, I\u2019m better looking, more interesting, more special, etc. But she says nothing of the kind.\n\u201cWhat about the dogs?\u201d I\u2019m running out of things to say before she leaves.\n\u201cThey started out as regular dogs. But because they\u2019re exposed to so many patients with out-of-sync senses of time, the structures in their brain have changed.\u201d\n\u201cI have only one last wish.\u201d I stare at her bright eyes in the darkness, like a pair of fireflies. \u201cCome and look at the fish in the waterways with me. Maybe they\u2019re the only creatures in this world who live real lives.\u201d\nThe fireflies brighten. She touches my face lightly. \u201cActually . . . \u201d\nI silence her lips with my fingers. I shake my head. I\u2019ve succeeded. There\u2019s no need for her to tell me what she\u2019s going to tell me, the three heaviest words in the world.\nBut she gently moves my hand away, and says three words, three different words.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid.\u201d\nI\u2019m alone by the waterway, staring at the fish.\nShe\u2019s gone, leaving behind no way to contact her. Sand pricks my palms. No matter how hard I squeeze, they slip away.\nFish, oh fish, you\u2019re the only ones left to keep me company.\nSuddenly, I feel an intense jealousy of these fish. Their lives are so simple, so pure. There\u2019s only one direction\u2014against the current. They do not have to hesitate, overwhelmed by an endless array of choices. But if I really lived a life like that, maybe I\u2019d still complain. A man is never content with what he has.\nSuddenly I want to spit at myself for my self-love, self-pity, self-obsession, self-self. But in the end I do nothing.\nI look at one single fish: it\u2019s pushed away from its school by the current. Once, twice, thrice. It falls behind, waves its tail madly, and returns to its position.\nFuck. It\u2019s tough.\nBut wait.\nWhy is it always this one fish? Why is its trajectory and movement always exactly the same?\nI wait, unblinking.\nTwo minutes later, that same little fish again drifts away from the school, again waves its tail madly, again returns to its position.\nI lift the stone in my hand.\nThe stone falls through the holographic fish and sinks to the bottom of the waterway.\nI have nothing left in my hand, not even a single grain of sand.\nMy rehabilitation over, I\u2019m on my return flight with my not-so-healthy mind and not-so-happy body. The airplane hasn\u2019t taken off yet but the cabin is already filled with snores.\nI guess some people at least have been fully rehabilitated.\nSuddenly the idea of returning to that concrete jungle to struggle against my fellow time-compressors disgusts me.\nThe plane takes off. Cities, roads, mountains, rivers\u2014everything recedes into a small chessboard composed of parti-colored squares. In every square, time flows faster or slower. The people below throng like a nest of ants controlled by an invisible hand, divide into a few groups, are stuffed into the different squares: time flies past the laborer, the poor, the \u201cthird world\u201d; time crawls for the rich, the idle, the \u201cdeveloped world\u201d; time stays still for those in charge, the idols, the gods . . .\nSuddenly, two fat hands belonging to a child appear before me, holding the entire world in them, backs of the hands up.\n\u201cLeft or right?\u201d\nI look to the left and then right. I\u2019m frightened. I have no way to pick.\nMocking laughter.\nI lunge and grab both fists and force the fingers open: both are empty, both lies.\n\u201cSir, sir!\u201d\nThe pretty flight attendant wakes me. Now I finally remember the origin of that dream. It was my cousin who tormented me as a child. His favorite game was to force me to guess in which hand he had hidden the candy he took away from me. He loved to tease me because I was always hesitant, always had trouble deciding.\n\u201cSir, would you like soda, coffee, tea or something else?\u201d\n\u201c . . . you.\u201d\nShe blushes.\nI smile at her. \u201cI just want coffee, black.\u201d\nThis is the only truly free choice I have left.\n\"The Fish of Lijiang\" was originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, May 2006.\nChen Qiufan was born in 1981, in Shantou, China.

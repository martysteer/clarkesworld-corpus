Gracie widened her stance so they wouldn\u2019t pitch forward onto the kitchen floor while he screeched, an emphatic, full-bodied \u201cNO\u201d that felt like the crunch of a car accident one block over. Except he didn\u2019t really say \u201cNO,\u201d it was instead this\u2014noise\u2014not a word, but a howl.\n It had started when he turned two, just when she was waiting for a sudden explosion of words. He made the sound when she took his boots off, carried him in the front door, gave him cocoa, denied him the iPad, allowed him the iPad, but not the cartoon he wanted. She\u2019d given up on talking through it: you can\u2019t run out into the street, you have to hold my hand, you can\u2019t stay at the park forever. Instead, she held him and waited as he vibrated in defiance. She vibrated in sympathy.\n In her arms he changed from cat to cannonball, grinding into her hip bone. Then fish, sliding over her arms and hands, then he was a pinching crab. Clinging to him, exhausted, she made a sound like a croon or a sleepy purr.\n It stopped them both. He changed again, now warm and still. He whispered the first new word in months: \u201c[ ].\u201d\n And he curled into her arms, his head resting on her shoulder, an egg cuddled into her chest. Looking down at him, she wondered that he was the same boy who\u2019d shape-shifted from spike to stone to crab, and now fit perfectly into her arms. It was hard to believe he had ever been hard to hold.\n \u201cYou\u2019re an egg,\u201d she said. \u201cMy little egg.\u201d\n But he had fallen asleep between one word and another. She was left doubting what she had heard anything like \u201c[ ],\u201d which was a word both unfamiliar and true. It might be an exhausted mother hoping for meaning in the noise. Nevertheless she muttered it, testing the sound: \u201c[ ]. [ ].\u201d\n Munira sat across the desk, a manila folder open in front of her.\n \u201cTell me why you came in.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did you first notice?\u201d\n \u201cHe has trouble.\u201d Munira\u2019s easy hands and professional watchfulness made Gracie at once comfortable and guarded, her shoulders rising toward her ears. Alex wasn\u2019t the only person being evaluated, she guessed. \u201cTrouble talking. I say. I say use your words. But he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n Alex refused to roll the ball toward the child, who asked nicely, \u201cwould you like to share?\u201d Sunny curls and a red playsuit. Her mother standing back, glancing down at her phone.\n \u201cNo,\u201d with such force the little girl took a step back. Then she stepped forward again, her bottom lip pushed out in reproach.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not very good at sharing,\u201d she said. Each syllable clear, the voice of a good kindergarten teacher, a beloved but strict grandparent.\n Then she reached for the ball.\n \u201cIt\u2019s her ball, Alex,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cLet her\u2014\u201d\n \u2014He scooped it up then. \u201cIt\u2019s hers,\u201d she repeated, trying to cover the space between them.\n When he made the sound, he was still crouching, but now the girl crunched on her back in the gravel, and Gracie couldn\u2019t tell how it had happened.\n \u201cAlex!\u201d Her own strangled shout. \u201cAlex!\u201d\n Then the mother was there as well, the little girl bawling while Gracie picked Alex up and kicked the ball over to mother and daughter, locked in their own moment together. Alex wailed into her shoulder. A feeling like gravel in her chest.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said.\n The other mother laughed uncomfortably, rocking the little girl back and forth on her hip. \u201cKids. Won\u2019t be the last time.\u201d She glanced at Alex, burrowing. The little girl wiped her eyes. The woman set her down, and she ran back to the slide, ignoring Alex. \u201cHe seems upset\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYeah I think he\u2014\u201d silence, then, \u201cHe\u2019s tired. We should\u2014\u201d\n She shrugged and walked homeward, Alex still clinging. He whispered in her ear. \u201c[ ].\u201d\n It was not just what the sound meant\u2014his disorientation and pain, his discomfort, his sadness\u2014but the physical effects of the sound that stopped her, rough against her brain, overrunning her nerves with broken fingernails. His voice caught on her in a way she had never before experienced. Motherhood, she imagined. This must be that maternal connection they always talk about. Was it supposed to be so complicated?\n Mal didn\u2019t have the same trouble. He\u2019d say, dadly, \u201ccome on kid, not in my ear\u201d when Alex climbed up his back and sat on his shoulders, shrieking with laughter.\n \u201cDoes he point?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good. That\u2019s important.\u201d\n \u201cBut. Is that enough? You worry.\u201d\n \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Munira\u2019s voice inviting, her hands open, her shoulders low. The familiar and clinically friendly posture of therapists and psychologists.\n \u201cBecause the world is full of awful things? And kids who can\u2019t talk\u2014\u201d\n A playground full of children. One little girl with a high-pitched shriek that drove Gracie through the trees to a chain-link fence that adjoined a farm where she could examine the grass, the birds with the focused attention of a child trying not to be seen. Sometimes the other kids left her alone. Sometimes they didn\u2019t. She imagined Alex a few years from now, going off to first grade, and\u2014\n \u201cIt\u2019s. He\u2019s. Delayed.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe. But delays don\u2019t have to be catastrophic. We know a lot about expressive language acquisition. And we\u2019re going to figure out what Alex needs.\u201d\n He was out there, right now, with the speech pathologist, little boy in a little room, the brittle cheerfulness of institutional toys. Animal decals on the walls, squirrels, and elephants two-by-two through the Garden of Eden. She had watched him through the window, one small hand reaching toward the toys. It hurt her heart to think this was just the beginning.\n \u201cSo how many words does he use regularly?\u201d\n \u201cOh. One. Two\u2014\u201d she counted on her fingers. \u201cHe says Mommy and Daddy. Alex. It\u2019s okay. Juice. No. Maybe seven? Do foreign words count? Or made up?\u201d\n Munira stopped. \u201cMade up?\u201d\n \u201cI mean. Everything\u2019s an arbitrary sign blah blah blah. But we also say things like [ ] or [ ]. We say those a lot.\u201d\n For the first time in their meeting, Munira looked surprised, and Gracie saw the mind behind her professional demeanor: curious, pleased. She asked quickly, \u201cWhat language is that?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I heard it when I was a kid. My grandma was\u2014it\u2019s probably highland something. Gaelic.\u201d\n \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like\u2014what was that again?\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d she said, and felt the blush of firelight on her skin. She wished Alex was in her arms to share it, so they could imagine together the way a room heated by a woodstove felt when you opened the door on a wet evening, heat emanating from the stony mass of the chimney. The sweet smell of wood burning, its music.\n Munira sounded it out. \u201cGrckqhsh?\u201d Hearing it put wrong startled Gracie out of her reverie.\n \u201cNo. [ ]. It\u2019s probably an obscure Norse word.\u201d\n \u201cKrrrrichs? Cchchhkssj?\u201d She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything like that. It\u2019s the oddest sound, usually you can recognize language patterns, and I studied Old Icelandic\u2014could I record that? Or maybe the first word you said.\u201d\n Gracie hesitated. \u201cIf you\u2014\u201d\n Munira pulled out her phone. \u201cCould you say that twice? With a pause in between?\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d Gracie said, \u201c[ ].\u201d\n \u201cAnd what does it mean?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to. It means kind of longing. Separation, maybe? Loneliness. I say it when I\u2019m telling him goodbye. Saudade. Sehnsucht.\u201d\n \u201cYes. That\u2019s what I guessed, maybe it shares a root with\u2014anyway. You don\u2019t often hear something genuinely new. I\u2019m going to send that to a friend who can probably tell you what dialect your Grandma was speaking.\u201d Here Munira smiled, unprofessionally delighted. \u201cBut, Alex. So you\u2019ve been teaching him these words? And he\u2019s comfortable using them?\u201d\n \u201cI guess. They come up.\u201d\n \u201cSo we\u2019ll call it a vocabulary of ten words.\u201d After a bright moment of confusion and joy, the institutional calm had reasserted itself. It was both lonely and comforting, a necessary loss.\n \u201cJust give me a moment and then we\u2019ll talk to Mikkel about the evaluation.\u201d\n Gracie waited in the still, beige room, admiring the medical diagrams of the larynx, of Broca\u2019s area, the infant development charts on the acquisition of language, the drawings by children\u2014Munira\u2019s kids?\u2014of flowers and crooked unicorns. She remembered this morning, when Alex said \u201c[ ].\u201d Not \u201capple\u201d like the logo on the back of a computer, but cool skin against the palm of her hand as she stopped on her way to the bus stop, late September morning soaked through with dew. She pulled it from the tree and polished it shiny before she bit into it. That was [ ].\n Eating his breakfast apples, Alex bit. Smiled. Bit again. Then looked up and said, \u201c[ ].\u201d\n In that moment nothing was wrong with either of them. But then he tried his tongue at English, and it was different: words sounded once, never to be repeated. Maybe none of them were words, just accidents that she, in her hopefulness, had named. Which was why they were here, to be evaluated, and start spending long afternoons in beige playrooms, with plastic toys a million other children had mouthed.\n She was in the waiting room when Munira rejoined her.\n \u201cTake this card,\u201d she handed Gracie a rectangle of thin gray plastic. \u201cThey\u2019re offering some new resources and techniques. It might be useful.\u201d\n \u201cAre they part of the ministry?\u201d\n \u201cNo\u2014NGO. But doing excellent work. You should call.\u201d\n Gracie thought of classrooms and living rooms where, as a child, she had sat in terrified silence, fearing the sounds that came out when she tried to speak. None of that would happen to Alex.\n She\u2019d been bent over a smartphone, absorbed, her face unresponsive. He\u2019d been six months old, dozing in her lap, and seen that blank nightmare mask of a mother. Her disregard had permanently scarred him. The core trauma of his life already underway and unstoppable: parents so busy with their work and themselves that he, little visitor, found himself too often alone, a social animal in unnatural isolation, like an orca in a tank at Sea World. Or a rhesus monkey snatched from his mother and consigned to the stainless-steel pit of despair, surrounded by nothing but the distortions of that mirror, the reverberating cries of his isolation. For science.\n \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Malcolm whispered when he lay with Alex asleep in the crook of his arm. \u201cI mean, I get the feeling, because we all suck as parents. But kids develop at their own pace.\u201d\n Alex had been fretful all day, refusing naps, refusing all food but apples and ice cream. He had finally fallen asleep, his hands curled around Mal\u2019s sleeve. They were too tired to move.\n \u201cBut it\u2019s so many things. How he is. You know. With kids.\u201d\n Mal snuggled Alex closer to his chest. Alex turned over and burrowed his head farther into his father\u2019s armpit. \u201cHe\u2019s healthy. He\u2019s our little guy. Don\u2019t worry so much.\u201d\n She rested her head on Mal\u2019s chest, hearing his heartbeat and Alex\u2019s sleeping breath. Closing her eyes, she felt the slow nighttime cadence of their family, drifting into stillness, while outside the last light faded, and the crescent moon rose\u2014leaving a smudge on the water of a black inlet that filled the darkness behind her eyelids.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Mal asked, rousing, the room lit by his phone. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n \u201c[ ].\u201d she repeated, and then she was asleep again, standing on the moonlit edge of that dark inlet.\n \u201cHi. It\u2019s Munira. I\u2019m wondering if you followed up on that study I told you about. I\u2019ve been talking to the primary investigator, and I really think Alex is a good candidate. I\u2019m going to email you the info on the card.\u201d\n Sometimes when he was asleep, sprawled in his little-boy exhaustion, she thought she saw the man he would one day be. She loved that man, too, as she loved all the varieties of Alex from infancy to the distant years after her own death.\n The gray plastic card was still in her purse, where she had kept it carefully. She practiced. \u201cHello, Hello, Hello. My name. Is Grace.\u201d\n The more she spoke, the more awkward the words were in her mouth. \u201cHello. Hello. My name is Grace. Grace Feradach. Grace. F. E. R. A. D. A. C. H. Grace. Hello. My son Alexander.\u201d Her hand shook on the phone, \u201cmy name is. Gr\u2014\u201d she began again. \u201cName\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAlexander,\u201d she said carefully, \u201cyes I\u2019ll hold yes I\u2019ll hold yesillhold\u201d and felt the consonants and vowels sliding, stranger with each repetition, until they were a morass of clicks and whistles. Yesillholdalexandergracehellohellohello. Feradach. Feradach.\n She had to be careful not to over-rehearse, or the words came back to her like echoes, bouncing out of her mouth when she didn\u2019t mean it. Once, freshly dumped at twenty, she had walked home drunk from his house saying I hate you I hate you I hate youihateyouihateyouihate, first under her breath, then slowly\u2014she realized midway through the walk\u2014out loud to the blackened streets. Three a.m. in the kitchen, her roommate came home too, and she\u2019d meant to say how was your night mine sucked dead bears, but what had come out was I hate you.\n Steph had burst into tears. It had taken her weeks of apologies to fix it, and things had always been a little weird after that.\n She stopped practicing, in case yesillhold came out of her mouth when she meant to ask Mal if he wanted last night\u2019s leftovers for lunch.\n She breathed the way she had been taught, from her belly, and dialed the number, listening to the chime at the other end and the posh woman\u2019s voice announcing that she should wait for all options before she made her choice. A voice like polished concrete in a gray-glass office.\n \u201cHello,\u201d the gray concrete woman said. \u201cYou\u2019ve reached the Genesis Project. Please enter your seven-digit code.\u201d\n \u201cMy name is\u2014\u201d then she stopped, flipped over the card, and saw the tiny numbers on the other side.\n This time a man\u2019s voice, warm and low.\n \u201cHi, Tom Pryce. How can I help you?\u201d\n \u201cHi. Hello. Hi. My name is Gracie, and someone gave me your card about a. About a. A.\u201d Here she floundered, as she always did when speaking to new people.\n Tom seemed to realize, and carried on in that warm, slow voice. \u201cYou\u2019re interested in the program, aren\u2019t you? Did Munira tell you about us?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant. Excellent clinician and we\u2019re lucky she\u2019s part of outreach.\u201d He said it easily, like she hadn\u2019t babbled. Like he understood. \u201cOkay, so this is for your son?\u201d\n She paused, then meant to say, my son, but what came out was \u201c[ ],\u201d which Alex said pointing to his chest, and which she repeated often because it made him laugh and pat his chest. She hadn\u2019t said it for months. It encouraged him.\n She covered her mouth, like she could snatch the sounds back. But the silence was brief, and Tom carried on, as though he had not noticed her gibberish. \u201cGreat! We work with a lot of kids with expressive language issues.\u201d\n \u201cOkay. K.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m going to text you a link to the app, okay? It\u2019s still in beta, but it\u2019ll give you an idea of what we do. And you can use it to set up an appointment if you\u2019re interested. You\u2019ll need the number on your card to register.\u201d\n \u201cK. I. K.\u201d She wanted to laugh\u2014no talking to anyone if she didn\u2019t want to, just an app. No stumbling over her words, no embarrassed blush when she misspoke.\n Tom was as his voice sounded: intelligent, warm, around her own age.\n \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing a few points of concern. Cognitively he\u2019s great. Fine and gross motor skills are excellent, weight, height, all that\u2014he\u2019s aggressively healthy, this little guy\u2014but you\u2019ve already seen his issues with expressive language. Is there a family history of language delays?\u201d\n \u201cNot on Mal\u2019s side. My father stuttered.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d He probably knew the minute she opened her mouth. Most people did\u2014she put them off. She never knew when to start talking, when to stop, and she had to think so carefully about when to make eye contact and when to break it. You couldn\u2019t stare too long, but if you didn\u2019t look at them, people shifted uncomfortably. The more she thought about it, the stranger her performance grew.\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t ever diagnosed.\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2019ve been through a bunch of. You know. Sensory stuff. Anxiety. No diagnosis. But I always wondered if.\u201d\n She wanted to explain that the words in her head worked. She understood words on the page, too, even if she preferred other media: colors, for example, were far easier to understand and manipulate. Numbers, too, and diagrams. But when it really mattered, her voice went wrong, an empty and hollow thing that honked and whispered, words emptied of meaning as she rehearsed them hellohowareyouihateyouitsokay. She tensed for the usual response: he\u2019d jump in, offer a word, finish her sentence. He did neither.\n \u201cAs a kid. They took me out of the regular system one year, but I wasn\u2019t held back or anything. Sometimes the wrong word, you know, to my mouth. I\u2019d think. I want an apple, but what came out wasn\u2019t apple. It was.\u201d She waved her hand.\n \u201cSo when you talk to Alex . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m so careful when I talk to him. To say things good. Right. Correct, you know. I say it all. Good. I talk.\u201d She tried to find the words, but they slid away from her, and inverted themselves, and she could not make her tongue shape them\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\n She discovered over the course of that first week that Tom liked to talk. He talked right through her awkward silences, answering questions she couldn\u2019t form, like he could see the direction her mind had leaped in as she listened.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve experimented with other methods, and we\u2019re still looking for a way to record the total acquisition of language. Our goal isn\u2019t just to understand how language functions on a practical level, but what it is. It started, oh, twenty years ago, at U of T\u2014have you ever heard of Dr. Harlow? Worked on AI and linguistics and neurology. Do you want another cup of coffee? Because you just have to ask and\u2014no, I\u2019m happy if you\u2019re happy. Anyway. Carnegie and his wife had a baby just when he needed to do a NSERC application. We funded him, too, so he could basically wire his kid. They set up cameras in all the public rooms in their house, and the kid\u2019s bedroom, and recorded his entire life, audio, and video. The expensive part wasn\u2019t the actual equipment\u2014that\u2019s a one-time purchase\u2014it was managing the data. And that\u2019s where we came in\u2014we helped design software that could organize and search these recordings. Some poor bastard grad students were in charge of uploading all the data. We fed the software everything we could find on language acquisition, so it could identify patterns in the recordings. Harlow basically made a career out of watching his kid learn to speak. Now he does TED Talks. And we\u2019re still using the software and the archive he built.\u201d\n The kid must be at least twenty by now. Did he know at the time he helped uncover the very core of human nature?\n \u201cIt\u2019s a massive archive, not just Harlow\u2019s kid, but everything we had in our collections, and all the other research going on in language acquisition. And we\u2019ve learned some pretty interesting things that let us help kids who are struggling.\u201d\n Was he embarrassed by these videos? Did he make snarky comments at family dinners, pass the potatoes, would you like to capture my cognitive-linguistic development, Dad?\n \u201cEspecially now, since the original software has also evolved, and we\u2019re using some current developments in machine learning. It sees things we don\u2019t\u2014patterns, correlations. And the more kids involved, the more sophisticated the analysis.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re. Watching?\u201d\n \u201cI understand your concern\u2014I do! But it\u2019s anonymized. And we give back as much as we receive. Kids come out of here talking, Gracie. We\u2019ve had a hand in creating some serious little chatterboxes.\u201d\n She wanted to tell him how bright Alex was, how perceptive, how gentle with cats he met on the sidewalk, how he imitated the cries of gulls when he was a baby, and how the crows seemed to speak back to him from the branches overhead. She wanted to say all that, but she felt a deep, queasy panic that made no sense.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Tom began, as though he read her mind, \u201cgoing to surveil Alex\u2019s whole life. That\u2019s not what we want. We\u2019ve benefited from so many kids like Alex, it\u2019s part of our mandate to give back to the community. These little guys are the real heroes. With a little help we can rescue them.\u201d\n She nodded.\n \u201cSo, we\u2019ll offer Alex a place in our eight-week program. We can revisit at the end and talk about the second phase.\u201d\n She felt herself standing then, his hand was on her shoulder, walking her toward the door.\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to need blood samples from Alex, and you, and Mal. I\u2019ll get you the releases. You can read over them at your leisure. And don\u2019t worry\u2014your genomes don\u2019t end up on any government database or anything. It\u2019s all just ours.\u201d\n \u201cBut. Just.\u201d He stopped and waited for her to continue, which surprised her. \u201cWhere does the money come from?\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Tom laughed. \u201cTelecoms, mostly. The Org owns a couple of very useful but boring patents.\u201d\n Then they were at the door to the yellow room, and she could see Alex through the window, at play in the sunny window with a beautiful young woman sitting cross-legged beside him. He threw back his head and laughed and handed her a toy. When she opened the door, he scrambled over to her and seemed to fly up and into her arms.\n \u201cWhat? No.\u201d\n \u201cBut early intervention in language acquisition is vital, and every delay costs his social, emotional, and cognitive development.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do they even need my DNA?\u201d\n \u201cThis is a huge longitudinal study, one of the first of its kind combining genetic and social and educational and economic factors. All of them cross-referenced over a population of tens of thousands. They have an AI. Or. Something.\u201d\n \u201cYou sound like a press release.\u201d\n She blushed. Everything she\u2019d just said she\u2019d read in the app and memorized. But then she thought of Alex at the park, shoving the little girl. She began again: \u201cMal. He needs\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014I wouldn\u2019t even do the test Mom sent us at Christmas. And how much did she hassle me about that? I don\u2019t trust DNA collection.\u201d\n He couldn\u2019t. Not when there was a chance to get Alex real help. Without thinking she stood up, her fingers tied up in fists. Mal was at the sink still, fiddling with one of the plants on the windowsill. \u201cDo these need water?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cNo,\u201d it wasn\u2019t a shout, but some quality in her voice had intensified. \u201c[ ].\u201d\n He stopped. Startled into attention.\n She felt the command in her voice, and she was afraid. She had never seen him look that way before, his eyes wide, receptive. Her stance belligerent, shoulders tight, jaw clenched.\n Then the moment passed, and he relaxed, spoke as though she had not interrupted their conversation, \u201cI just don\u2019t want Alex\u2019s grandkid turned down for a job because my DNA is in a bank somewhere and it says he\u2019s an INTJ and a cancer risk and a bad fit for the company.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014they won\u2019t use it like that.\u201d\n Mal laughed. She liked his laugh. He touched her hand.\n \u201cThere are other ways to help him that don\u2019t, you know, fundamentally compromise my privacy.\u201d\n Tom shook his head. \u201cThe thing is, we need the data. It\u2019s out of my hands.\u201d\n \u201cYou have mine. And Alex\u2019s.\u201d\n Delicately, and with total attention, Alex picked up a block on the floor of the yellow room.\n \u201cWe need a complete archive. I\u2019m really sorry. I was hoping we could help you. Dr. Peterson is the speech therapist\u2014a really excellent researcher\u2014and she was looking at Alex\u2019s file. Making a plan, you know.\u201d\n \u201cIs there,\u201d she heard herself ask, \u201canything else I can do?\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d Alex said, not looking at her. The sound he made for reassurance. The sound he would\u2019ve made, she always thought, if they were out hunting and gathering and she had left him in a nest of grass while she picked apples or dug clams. The sound they would have sung to one another, that meant only \u201chere I am\u201d and \u201cI am here, too!\u201d\n \u201c[ ].\u201d she answered.\n \u201cLook,\u201d Tom said, \u201cwe might be able to waive Mal\u2019s direct involvement if we get the data. I really believe Alex has a chance with us. Does your husband have a hairbrush?\u201d He asked it like it was a prank, something fun and silly they would do before, surprise, everything worked out on the end.\n She felt cold.\n \u201cYou can tell him later, once Alex has the help he needs. I doubt he\u2019ll argue with the results.\u201d\n She made a sound, not quite a word.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just information. That\u2019s all. It\u2019ll be anonymized. Just make sure you get follicles\u2014and don\u2019t accidentally bring some of yours.\u201d He laughed. \u201cOnce we tested dog hair. That was a genetic mystery.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d she began.\n \u201cJust. Take the kit, and if the opportunity presents itself, you know. Grab it.\u201d\n \u201cIf I\u2014don\u2019t. Can Alex still come?\u201d\n Tom shrugged. \u201cSure, the initial program\u2014that\u2019s open to everyone. But if you want to take part in the really cutting edge stuff, you\u2019re going to need Mal\u2019s DNA.\u201d\n When she and Mal were first going out, he used to visit her in the room she rented just off Quebec and 14th. Every time he knocked on her window she startled. Once she fell off her office chair. He laughed, then rubbed her shoulder. \u201cYou knew I was coming,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m made like this,\u201d she said lightly, unnerved that these unfortunate effects had returned to her, her clumsy voice, her startle reflex, her exhausting misophonia. Every time she thought she\u2019d learned to act like a person, this happened: a new experience\u2014puberty, love, motherhood\u2014and she was back again, retranslating her whole changing self into a language she had never learned to speak. She had thought: Mal will be a good father. He\u2019ll teach his kids to speak like people, and I can fade mutely into the background.\n She\u2019d thought Alex would be okay. Every time she brought it up, and every time Mal reminded her about Alex\u2019s eye contact, his early walking, his early smile, how much he enjoyed sitting in their laps and looking at pictures, touching the pages of books. His acute hearing, when in the backyard his head raised, he pointed at the trees, and after a moment\u2019s concentration Gracie, too, heard birdsong.\n Tom talked about the fusiform gyrus, the architecture of facial recognition deep in the brain. It didn\u2019t even work through the same channels as language because you knew faces with a part of your brain far more essential than that which decoded, say, the letters F, A, C, and E. Same with snakes. We can see them and react to them without knowing what we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ll be overcome with dread, and flee, and only later realize the snake we avoided in the grass. He told her about the FOX2P gene, how it\u2019s linked directly with human speech, but deviations in birds can affect their songs, too. Damage to that gene\u2014or its absence\u2014changes expressive language radically.\n He talked about the growing white matter in the maternal brain during gestation, the neural networks dismantled and rebuilt to perceive signals from the prelinguistic child. Hunger. Loneliness. Fear. No conscious work, this, but communication so different from language, words seemed irrelevant. Affect, Gracie thought, but did not say it. The deep sea of meaning that underlies those flimsy little words. The richest parts of our selves beyond the reach of language, and words only float on it, moved by currents far deeper than anything they communicate, a rich, dark inlet of the great sea of meaning we cannot ever hope to speak.\n \u201cBut what if,\u201d Tom asked, conspiratorial, \u201cthere was a language that bypassed conscious representation the way snakes and faces do? It\u2019s more like pheromones. Like music or empathy. If you hug someone for thirty seconds, you\u2019ll both release oxytocin. It\u2019s not about the mind\u2014it\u2019s about body speaking to body. It\u2019s a kind of truth that language can never capture.\u201d\n His soothing gold tones, the sound of a sunny room full of geraniums. She thought: it\u2019s what I feel when Alex is fractious, and I hold him until he aligns himself with my heartbeat, calm again. When he was a baby, he couldn\u2019t regulate his temperature or his emotions. I lent him my quiet and my warmth. That\u2019s what I was there for.\n \u201cIt\u2019s there on a cellular scale, even. If you put living heart cells together\u2014even from different species\u2014they\u2019ll synchronize. I keep asking myself if that\u2019s a kind of language. Or communication. And what kind of language would that be?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not. It\u2019s.\u201d\n She could not speak, but the thought formed, not a word but a series of impressions. Two people sharing something essential, filamentary connections that extended beyond the flesh, a subtle element that bypassed the siloed loneliness of the singular, repudiating the broken vessel that is the word. She thought of the way her heart hurt when Alex wept. How she knew Mal was frustrated because of the way the air crackled. How she knew he\u2019d had a good day at work, that he was hungry. How she had known the first time he kissed her what he felt, the confusion between them, skin against skin.\n \u201cGracie?\u201d\n \u201c-\u201d\n \u201cGracie?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s.\u201d She tried again. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s [ ].\u201d\n Their first awkward silence. He was staring at her, his mouth open, the way he always did when her carefully construction performance failed. She collected herself, looked at her phone. \u201cAlex is done the. I better.\u201d Then, fumbling, she picked up her bag and knocked over the chair as she stood up. Tom caught it.\n \u201cI\u2019ll see you next\u2014week. Our next meeting.\u201d\n \u201cThursday.\u201d\n At the door to the playroom, Alex threw himself into her arms. She wanted to tell Tom thank you, to say, it\u2019s working, while Alex buzzed all the way home, a happy sympathetic hum in the back seat that warmed her, despite the rain. Before she got him out of the car seat at home, she wrote a text\u2014Alex is so happy thanks so much\u2014and deleted it.\n Alex arrived at his sessions curious, left exhausted, descending into tears each evening. She stopped taking him anywhere but to the yellow playroom where the young woman sat cross-legged beside him.\n \u201cAren\u2019t you taking him to the library?\u201d Mal asked one morning while Alex sat bashing trucks into one another.\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you guys do story time?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cBut. Why not?\u201d\n \u201cLast time I took him he. He.\u201d\n Mal waited as long as he could. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d he prompted.\n The little boys beside him screeched at the top of their lungs, laughing, screeching, laughing. She felt it\u2014fingernails on the inside of her spine, beestings on her eardrums\u2014and knew he did, too. But she had learned\u2014after years of discomfort\u2014to live with those noises.\n The boys screeched again. Laughed. Screeched.\n \u201cSettle down,\u201d from the tired librarian. Screech. Gracie looked around for a supervising mom. Alex crouching now, on his knees.\n \u201cDo you think,\u201d Gracie began to say to the librarian, \u201cwe could\u2014\u201d\n \u2014Screeeeech\u2014\n It happened as quickly as the incident in the park, only this time she felt it like a current in water. He made that sound, [ ], then the three toddlers nearest him were on their backs, howling in an even higher register.\n \u201cHe hit me! He hit me!\u201d One of the boys shouted.\n Mothers intervened. From somewhere far away, a woman with a stack of books ran toward the story circle, the boy continued to scream and tumbled at her feet. She dropped the books and gathered him up. Alex was at her feet, too, ears covered, pressed into her thigh, crying.\n \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d She heard someone say.\n \u201cHe knocked down like five kids!\u201d\n \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be here\u2014\u201d Bilious green disapproval on her face, like sputum sprayed from an angry teacher.\n Alex\u2019s tears on her neck, his eyes covered as though the light hurt him. His arms and legs tight knots around her, the weight of him as she dipped to pick up her bag and walked toward the door, past the arriving librarians. A voice behind them, where do you think you\u2019re going?\n She didn\u2019t answer. He clung so tightly that his hands pinched her neck. Out onto the street, then back toward the parking lot, afraid to look up because what if they were following.\n \u201c[ ],\u201d he said, and she felt his longing for understanding, to make the pain in his head better. She knew that pain. She had spent thirty-five years learning to manage it.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she answered.\n \u201c[ ],\u201d he said again. This time it hit her in the chest.\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d he said again. Strong enough to hurt, a blow right through bone to her heart.\n \u201cWords, Alex. Use words.\u201d\n He struggled, then cried. \u201cKids mean!\u201d he said finally, the longest sentence he\u2019d spoken in months.\n Then her own anger collapsed, and they curled together around the hurt in their hearts. \u201cI know. But we can\u2019t.\u201d\n She knew Mal loved her. When she was upset in the car, he handed her a granola bar and a bottle of water he kept in the glove box because she didn\u2019t always know she was hungry. He\u2019d started carrying juice boxes, too, on the principle that Alex had the same problem. She knew Mal loved her because he waited on those tangled evenings when all words were garbled, and she\u2014like Alex\u2014threw up her hands in fists, ready to punch holes in the hollow-bodied doors of their home. She knew Mal loved her because when she used the wrong word he didn\u2019t laugh.\n She knew Mal loved her, so why was she contemplating the sterile plastic bag hidden in her sock drawer. Tom kept leaving messages. \u201cHey Gracie. Any luck bringing Mal around on the DNA?\u201d his voice easy to agree with. It was no trouble at all to take Mal\u2019s hair. A little hair\u2014who would begrudge that? No condemnation, just an indulgent eye roll at the man\u2019s peculiarity.\n \u201cHey Gracie, just checking in to see if Alex is going to make the Wednesday morning appointment. Jess is going to be coming in from Toronto to evaluate kids for the second phase. It\u2019s a great opportunity. Let me know.\u201d\n \u201cHey Gracie, Alex\u2019s report came back, and I think you\u2019ll be interested to hear a bit more about how he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n So. She rehearsed her speech while vacuuming the living room, it\u2019s a tiny thing that will make a huge difference. The vacuum cleaner stopped. She looked up to see Alex by the outlet, the plug in her hand, his tiny face stern.\n She plugged it in again. One swipe across the floor and he\u2019d unplugged it.\n \u201cNo. Stop it, Alex.\u201d\n She plugged it\u2014\n \u201c\u2014NO!\u201d\n She plugged\u2014\n \u201c\u2014STOP.\u201d\n She gave up. He pulled his LEGOs back out onto the half-vacuumed floor and began building stacks. Rocket ships. The trunks of trees. Then Mal was home again and she said, without preamble, \u201cIt\u2019s such a small\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014I just don\u2019t get the decision. It\u2019s the worst kind of NIMBYism. City hall declined the permit for the safe injection site, and it looks like we\u2019re going to have to go back to the old\u2014\u201d\n On the floor, Alex knocked over his towers.\n \u201cCould you not,\u201d she said, \u201cjust. It\u2019s such a small\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Hey, kiddo, give your mom a break. We\u2019ll write another proposal. But it\u2019s a waste of time. If they\u2019d just\u2014\u201d Mal\u2019s full-bodied sneeze, so loud it surprised even him. A nail through her ear.\n \u201c\u2014JUICE.\u201d Alex shouted. \u201cJUICE.\u201d\n \u201cSay please, dude.\u201d\n \u201cYou have to give them the DNA sample.\u201d\n \u201cDidn\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s such a small\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014JUICE.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t just give up on\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014There are a ton of other ways to\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014him.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n But that is misrepresentation: the sound she made was not the English \u201cNo.\u201d Neither was it a familiar word from the secret language. It was something new, like whiplash, a broken tooth. A sound like falling face-first on black ice. She felt its power as she shaped it not only with her lips and tongue, but with her diaphragm, her shoulders, channeled in a hurricane from her mouth.\n Their silence startled her as much as the sound she\u2019d made. Their faces blank, watching. Mal opened his mouth and closed it again. She left the room, shutting the bedroom door just as she heard Alex begin to cry.\n That was magic, to say a word and have it\u2014momentarily\u2014open up a conduit to the reservoir of feeling in which we all float, but from which we are separated by words, words, words. She felt it in music, and in the accidents of running water or birdsong, the cries of a child. All things\u2014death rattles and purrs and tears\u2014that channeled the unspoken. The Enochian. The Adamic. The language of birds and angels, of the spheres, the sounds that had knit ylem into reality as we know it.\n Then you could say, the house is haunted, and it would be suddenly true. Or a kid could scream out in rage and terror at another child and knock them down with the force of his anger. You could say to your husband, \u201c[ ],\u201d and he would comply, signing the consent form, and spitting into the DNA collection vial, his face calm and blank, as though his soul had been displaced by your voice and by the magic of [ ].\n Temporarily displaced. She hoped.\n There was so much she\u2019d forgotten that now returned to her, as though [ ] had cracked something in her mind. A spring evening, when it was still cold, but you could play outside after supper. She often sat in the garden of their little house where it backed onto a ravine. There were frogs, a hunting owl, rats rooting through garden refuse, mice and voles and rabbits. Once, after the stars came out, she heard a singular note of birdsong and called back to it, wondering if it was singing in its sleep.\n Until the evening she heard that sound, a scream tiny and incessant like an alarm, broadcasting its terror. It grew louder as she walked toward the ravine, and she grew more and more afraid of what it was. Not of anything the creature might do, but what had happened to it to make it cry out like that. She wanted to run away, let it die, but suffering stained the air and she stepped forward, covering her ears. Then\u2014knee deep in the ivy\u2014the scream intensified, and she thought maybe she\u2019d stepped on it and now blood gushed like panic from its mouth. She\u2019d made things so much worse. The new sound galvanized her skin, she felt, almost, as though the noise was not something she heard, but something that was now inside her brain, in her blood. It felt like alcohol on road rash, like nightmares and migraines. Like your mother turning away in brittle rage because you couldn\u2019t stop crying.\n So she ran away, the scream falling behind her, but the panic remaining. She wanted to cut the thread that bound her to that suffering creature, now burrowed into her heart.\n She wished she\u2019d dug through the ivy until she found where it was hidden. When she crept home, she had tried to talk about it over the bleed of the TV in the living room, where Mom sat smoking in the blue-dark and watched grown-up shows. \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive,\u201d she\u2019d said as she always did when Gracie wept. \u201cIt\u2019s nature.\u201d\n But Gracie knew the truth: she should have been a braver child, defied nature, found the wounded creature, and brought it home.\n By train to Toronto early the next morning. A car would collect them at Union.\n \u201cI don\u2019t get why. Like. Why do you have to.\u201d\n She put another stack of small T-shirts in the duffle bag. She couldn\u2019t look at him. If she did she would\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYou said how long but.\u201d\n \u201cTen days. They do this on-site therapy. It\u2019s supposed to be immersive. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n Mal yawned. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cYou need to sign the thing.\u201d\n While he signed\u2014slowly\u2014the parental release form, she collected books and stuffed animals and small cars. Alex and Mal sat on the couch watching cartoons. She ordered a pizza.\n \u201cI feel like I took a bunch of cold pills. Like I just hit the DXM or something.\u201d Asleep against Mal, Alex grumped. \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want me to drive you to the station?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll cab. Way too early.\u201d\n That was a lie. Much of what she had said to Mal in the last week was a lie. She felt the ugly weight of it in her mouth, the way she had leaned into his resistance and said, it\u2019s okay, and how that had left him fuddled and compliant. She felt how easy it would be to do this daily for virtuous reasons: to stop a fight, to put him to sleep, to prevent him from eating the chocolate he was allergic to but loved. All for his own good.\n She set the duffle bag by the door and swore\u2014in silence\u2014that this was the last time she would ever exercise her peculiar and terrible gift. She\u2019d get Alex the help he needed, then she\u2019d fall silent forever. But right now\u2014this moment, her hands shaking as she filled Alex\u2019s backpack with snacks and small cars\u2014she needed to be brave and reckless and dangerous.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you,\u201d she said to the sleeping house. No one answered.\n She lost her bearings north of Toronto, after the sun set. Soon after that, she lost reception. Their first stop in hours was at a tidy, chain-link gate. \u201cHow much further?\u201d she asked the driver. Alex asleep in the car seat, holding her hand.\n He cleared his throat, \u201cHalf an hour.\u201d\n When they stopped again, she woke, suddenly well-lit in the parking lot of a building surrounded by bush. Alex\u2019s resistant cries as she unbuckled him, and the driver had their bags, even her purse, before she realized.\n \u201cGrace! Alex! You guys must be exhausted. We have your room set up. Are you hungry?\u201d Tom\u2019s familiar, honeyish voice was a relief. She was happy to follow him through glass doors to a quiet room, lux and hotel-like, a large TV, a small kitchen.\n She stood at the huge windows, buzzing, an irritating, low-frequency sound that seemed to emanate from inside her own head, as though all the anxiety of the last months now flooded her auditory nerve. Alex hung in her arms like he was still a baby, his face buried in her neck.\n \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d\n Tom shrugged, \u201cMaybe climate control? I can\u2019t hear anything.\u201d\n But the next morning she woke with the same low buzz, like an oncoming migraine. Tom knocked at the door midmorning. For the first time in their acquaintance, he seemed brittle, nervy, his eyes bright, and his hands restless as they walked to the playroom where Alex would spend most of the next week. He showed her views from high windows, a sunny courtyard with a swing set. The unbroken horizon of boreal forest.\n \u201cWhere are the other kids?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cThe last group left on Sunday, and we\u2019re waiting for another cohort next week.\u201d\n \u201cI thought\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Alex is temporarily our sole charge, and I think he\u2019ll really benefit from that. You ready for that, buddy?\u201d\n \u201cIs that\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014you want to go play with some toys?\u201d Tom glad-handed, cheerful. \u201cThey have some awesome fire trucks in there.\u201d\n There was room for a dozen kids in the playroom, invisibly wired\u2014she guessed\u2014to record every utterance. Alex alone and doubtful, holding her hand until a pretty blonde woman took him away to the coloring books by the window.\n In Tom\u2019s office she tried to breathe deeply. It should be serene: blond wood, white walls, abstract art. Tom smiling and smiling and smiling. But the sound\u2014\n As though he recognized her disorientation, he started the conversation, \u201cSo. How are you doing.\u201d He said it like they were friends, one hand on her shoulder, with the comfortable manner that had enchanted her when they first met, which made conversation easier than it had ever been in her life. Which had brought her here.\n She struggled, \u201cI.\u201d\n \u201cI know. But now we\u2019re going to talk about you. And what you are.\u201d He laughed. \u201cGod, it feels good to just tell you everything. I haven\u2019t lied. But you had to trust me first, or I knew we\u2019d never get you here. I\u2019ve wanted so badly to tell you where you come from. Genetically. Epigenetically. I kind of don\u2019t know where to begin. But you\u2019re part of this project. A few centuries in the making.\u201d\n She licked her lips. They cracked. \u201cWhat. Are you looking. For.\u201d\n \u201cI told you weeks ago. The language the birds speak. The language of the spheres. We want to know the native language\u2014the mother tongue\u2014of the universe.\u201d\n There was no possible response to this statement.\n \u201cI know, it\u2019s insane. Actually we don\u2019t know if you speak it, exactly, but you\u2019re closer than a hundred thousand other experiments.\u201d\n \u201cIs there something wrong with your monitor? Where is that sound coming from?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s all been dead ends. A few hundred years ago we conjured angels in scry glasses and tried to translate what they told us. In Iowa in the 1930s, we induced stutters in the children at an orphanage because we thought perhaps the original language was socially created. We had families raise chimpanzees with human children in the 1940s. That led to more work on animals in the 1960s. We funded fieldwork in the Congo, with the gorillas. Then more primates and the isolation experiments.\n \u201cI told you about the software we wrote for Harlow. We also used it on our own archive. Centuries of stuff all integrated by machine learning. Genetic profiles and field notes. All the studies of Romanian orphans and hospitalism. It\u2019s giving us a God\u2019s-eye view of centuries of inquiry. Millenia, if we go back to Herodotus\u2019 account of Psamtik I.\n \u201cThis is where it gets strange. A couple of years ago that software flagged a record from the sixteenth century. Six children were placed on an island called Inchkeith in the Firth of Forth. Two young women cared for them, but were forbidden to speak to them, sing, even look them in the eye. It\u2019s a very old experiment and it always failed, but they kept trying. Apparently, they were onto something, because in this case one of the children survived. A little boy they named Enoch. He spoke words in a language the officers did not recognize, but which made them weep. However, when it was time to take him back to Edinburgh, Enoch and the young woman were gone.\u201d\n Through her headache, Gracie was visited by a strange and irresistible conviction. The girl was young, maybe eighteen, paddling through the blackened sound under a sliver of moon, a little boy strapped to her back. They traveled north, disappearing into the highlands. She was clever and wild, and she might not have understood what was happening, but she had watched the other children die. Enoch in her arms, a changeling, a creature no longer quite human, by reason of\u2014them. She loved him. She was brave.\n \u201cA hundred years ago\u2014fifty years ago\u2014we couldn\u2019t have followed up on Enoch. But now we can access genetic databases from Scotland and the diaspora. We were identifying FOX2P mutations in the R1b-M269 group and it seemed like another dead end. Until I thought of phonemes. Jesus. I just wish I could show you everything I\u2019ve learned, Gracie. I know you\u2019d understand it better than I can. We had to write a bunch of new code to analyze audio, so that slowed us down for a couple of years. But ultimately it worked. We fed it everything we could find, every utterance, ever field recording. And it found this. I think she\u2019s one of your kind. She\u2019s singing to bring the cattle home.\u201d\n His hands shook as he found it on his phone, and she listened, while the vision of the girl and the little boy persisted in her eyes. The woman\u2019s voice was elderly, without the range it must have once had, and her breath was short. She seemed to sway toward and away from the mic, a rhythmic swing in time to her call.\n She was sweating. She gripped her knees so her hands wouldn\u2019t shake. His eyes were brilliant, searching.\n He didn\u2019t seem to notice her fear, just showed her the image he found. \u201cSo this is where it was recorded, and this is where we found some curious genetic markers.\u201d A scattering of red on a map. \u201cAnd this is where your great-grandmother came from.\u201d Zooming out, Grace could see that the girl had carried Enoch as far north as she could from Inchkeith.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just Gaelic,\u201d she began. But no. Among the soft gutturals she heard something that cut through her heart, that might be mistaken for an artifact of recording, a fumble of the singer\u2019s tongue. But it wasn\u2019t: it was [ ] Come home, come home it sang to her, oh come home to me.\n Her eyes prickled. Home was Mal and Alex falling asleep in the early evening. Was he still sunk in cobwebs as she had left him? What had she done to\u2014\n \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d\n Come home [ ] come home to me [ ] the old woman sang, now joined by the lowing of cattle down from the high field, where\u2014\n \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n Mal was home, alone. Oh, come home, oh [ ].\n \u201c\u2014I can tell you recognize it.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s. Home. Like. Imagine it\u2019s eleven and you just finished your shift at Starbucks and locked up alone and it\u2019s raining, but you know someone is coming to get you, and you see their car turn the corner. Home.\u201d It meant\u2014but how would he grasp it?\u2014Mal and Alex cuddled together, asleep. It meant the bier in darkness, and the sound of breathing animals, the rain falling outside. It meant a girl\u2019s arms around the surviving child, carrying him to safety across the black water, guided only by the moonlight\u2014\n As she said it, the buzz in the room grew, once again, unbearable. She covered her ears.\n \u201cSay another word. Say something.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Say what you say to Alex when he\u2019s sad.\u201d\n She swallowed drily.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n \u201cSay it again.\u201d\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n \u201cI can almost\u2014Sometimes I think I can. When I listened to you talking to Alex one night, when he couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014Don\u2019t look so shocked. We record everything within the range of your phone\u2019s mic. It\u2019s in the permissions on the app. Always read the EUA.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d she tried to say. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSay it again.\u201d\n She started to shape the sound, but something ruptured inside her. It breached her throat, and her tongue shaped it into a sound she had never made before. [ ].\n Tom cried out. Fell back like he\u2019d been shoved. When he straightened again he smiled, and she was\u2014how could it be?\u2014more afraid of his smile than she had been of his demands.\n \u201cDo you know what I would give to be what you are? I tried. Salvia. DMT. Sweat lodges. TM for a while. Electroshock\u2014I have probes in my brain originally developed to treat Parkinson\u2019s. Back in the sixties some researchers thought trepanning was an early response to the loss of that faculty\u2014that we could regain our ancient voice through psychosurgery. I\u2019m slightly embarrassed to say I considered it.\u201d\n He laughed. Viscous spray from his mouth, where there had been the gold honey-tones of their first conversations.\n That night, she locked and dead bolted their door and pushed a chair against it before she lay down beside Alex. He tossed and climbed and floundered, refusing to stay still long enough to fall asleep. She, exhausted, slept briefly, then awakened to find him pawing at her face.\n \u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s wrong with my Alex?\u201d\n He covered his ears.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop it. But we\u2019ll leave in the morning, as soon as the sun comes up. I promise. We\u2019ll talk to Daddy, and he\u2019ll come get us.\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d a rough-edged grunt that buzzed her eardrums painfully.\n When he fell asleep\u2014after eleven\u2014it was in her bed with the blankets pulled up over his ears. She got up to check the locks, then sat at the open window so the sound of insects and trees could drown out the building\u2019s whine.\n She had been fighting it like a headache, but now in the quiet she closed her eyes and listened for the first time to the terrible ambient noise. It was the touch of a damp finger, a torn fingernail, a rusted wheel screaking on the edge of audibility. The flicker of the lights overhead so subtle she could not be sure it wasn\u2019t some throb of her eyes.\n \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she asked the air around her.\n What happened next was not a sound, but a bursting sensation inside her skull, like noise could shift muscle and bone and neuron with the weight of its longing. For what? For something precious and lost. For the loneliness of living in a world that cannot hear you.\n She remembered Alex when he was very small and fretful, ill at ease in the first weeks out of the womb. How she had lent him her calm and her stillness and helped him through that first strange transformation from inside to outside. She hadn\u2019t spoken, just let their heartbeats twin until he felt safe. She remembered the pain of his crying in those first weeks, her breasts heavy and leaking milk with each wail. She remembered how she had whispered nonsense syllables\u2014or so she\u2019d thought\u2014into Alex\u2019s ears, and how Mal lay there, too, and listened to the sounds of angels, and birds, and the world before Babel fell and we all lost one another, falling away into the lonely silos of our hearts and words.\n She collected her phone and their bags, filled a water bottle, and wrapped Alex in the coverlet. Then out the door, quietly down the hallway where they would\u2014if they had to\u2014walk out. She was down the stairs to the lobby, and through the window she saw moonlight.\n \u201cWhat are you doing, Gracie?\u201d Tom. Her heart accelerating. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night. Aren\u2019t you tired?\u201d\n \u201cI thought I heard\u2014is there another kid somewhere? Do you have\u2014\u201d\n \u201cJesus Christ! It\u2019s not like\u2014we don\u2019t have a dungeon or anything. You know, I didn\u2019t want to do this. But it should be fast. I hope. It\u2019s a blunt instrument.\u201d\n He fumbled for his phone. It started in her neck, a familiar prickle and crawl, a wriggling finger inside her spine. She gasped.\n \u201cAlex\u2014\u201d\n And then she recognized her own voice\u2014but not precisely her own voice. Some process had rendered it strange to her, and terrible, but she knew the moment they\u2019d recorded. It was the day she made Mal sign the release and give her the sample. She could hear the cruelty, the fear, in [ ], the sound of high treason committed against the man she loved.\n Alex was crying. She couldn\u2019t do anything. And Alex was crying, and now it crescendoed. The air itself grinding, like the machinery of the universe had locked up tight. The abjection of a child separated from his mother, like a rabbit dying in the ivy\u2014the sound\u2014\n \u201cYeah. We got that from your phone. It seriously made me feel bad for Mal. You\u2019re on the floor again. Don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t last long\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll like this. There are ancient records\u2014Herodotus mentions them, and Josephus\u2014You okay on the floor?\u201d\n The sky behind his head was blue. Somewhere, Alex was alone. The carpet beneath her was warm, surprisingly plush. She must\u2014\n \u201cWhere. Is Alex?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start soon. You don\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d\n The sickly grind of a car accident inside her head. \u201cWhere,\u201d she repeated.\n Then he was talking about epigenetic triggers that produce unexpected expressions of familiar genes. CHRM2, for example\u2014this is interesting\u2014in a positive environment, is associated with superior intelligence. But it\u2019s associated with mental illness and addiction in traumatic environments.\n \u201cYou carry an unusual mutation of CHRM2, which is usually recessive in women. You\u2019ve passed it on to Alex. You also have an unusually expressed HRM17, which interacts with both CHRM2 and the FOXP2. Do you understand? Four hundred years ago we triggered a change in your ancestor, and here you are. Our prodigal daughter.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said. The air rippled. \u201cStop.\u201d\n He shuddered, but his mouth still smiled.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n He coughed something thick and wet onto his desk. Then he had the phone again, and\u2014\n He told her: We have a dark history. We don\u2019t want to pretend otherwise. But should we give up everything we learned in those centuries? We\u2019re a different organization now. We reached our ethical event horizon in the last century, when we affiliated with Indian Affairs and started working on the reserves. Then in seventies, with the pit of despair, but that forced us to rethink our priorities, not least because it just didn\u2019t work. The rhesus monkeys went mad, and when they were impregnated, they ate their own children. It\u2019s a stain on the otherwise transcendent goal of our organization.\n He told her: Some of them wanted to harvest your eggs as soon as we\u2019d identified you, but I said no\u2014we\u2019ll start with the EEG and the neuronal probes and when she\u2019s ready, we\u2019ll think about eggs. Besides, you might need to gestate the children yourself\u2014the parental bond is obviously important.\n He told her: You can leave at any time. The doors aren\u2019t locked.\n He told her: Alex is fine. We\u2019re not monsters.\n He told her: We\u2019re not monsters.\n \u201c[ ],\u201d she said, \u201c[ ].\u201d\n The nurse attached the electrodes to her scalp with a thick paste. A thin shriek from somewhere nearby, maybe the walls, startled her like ice water. She struggled to sit, and Tom smiled, and she heard the warm purr still emanating like honey from his lips. A confusion of scent and sound\u2014\n \u2014That shriek again.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said to the nurse. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n Another electrode. She filled her lungs.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n The nurse looked surprised. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d he managed to say before she inhaled again.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n Like your knee slamming into the stone floor. Like a finger bent backward at the knuckle. Like stepping on a nail.\n He hit the floor. She had not expected the blood. She staggered to her feet as Tom fumbled for his phone, his nose bleeding.\n \u201cGracie. Please. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n In the dark hallway she crept forward by the light of the moon, which sailed over the black boreal forest outside, and she was more lost than she had ever been. She paused at each corner to listen for a footstep, or the sound of a door closing in a concrete stairwell. Nothing. Only the whine, growing now, of something deep in the building she could not name, which nevertheless called out to her, mumbling and roaring and chattering. A social creature in total isolation, tormented by a thousand thousand simulations that nevertheless failed to teach it the language of the birds and the spheres and the angels.\n She was afraid, but she must be brave and wild and clever and follow her ears and her instincts through the dark, listening at each door in turn, until she heard a tiny voice calling out.\n On the other side of the door, Alex lay sedated in a hospital bed, communing with a machine. Someone taking his pulse. Someone else watching. She had never hated like this before.\n \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d one of them began.\n \u201c[ ].\u201d\n She had done something. It was bad. The blond woman. The driver. Another woman she didn\u2019t recognize.\n Blood, some of it hers. The sun was far above the horizon. No cell reception. Alex sleepy, scratched the abraded skin at his hairline. The building had fallen silent, waiting for those strangers to wake again from their brief, violent sleep.\n She traced the red skin and found four points, as though he\u2019d been fixed in place, screws digging into his scalp. She found no flaps of skin where neuron-sized probes might have been inserted through a hole in his skull. She found no stitches.\n \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked him. He said nothing, rested his head on her shoulder.\n She shaded his eyes against the brilliance of the day. \u201cIt\u2019ll get better, I hope. [ ]?\u201d\n He drank the water across her hand, then set his head down again on her shoulder.\n She wondered if one of them was waking to blood trickling from nose and mouth. The red crusts in ears\u2014burst eardrums, perhaps. She knew, only, that she had carried away her thin, feverish Alex, and that in the darkness a strange, inhuman voice had helped her. That was something. Maybe. At home, Mal waited for them, and he was afraid. She would make it right. She would tell Munira the truth. She would be brave and clever and wild.\n \u201cCan you ride on my shoulders? We\u2019re going to have to steal a car.\u201d\n \u201c[ ],\u201d he responded, and she lifted him up and over her head. Somewhere above them, a bird sang.\n Rebecca Campbell is a Canadian writer and teacher whose speculative fiction has appeared most recently in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Shadows and Tall Trees.

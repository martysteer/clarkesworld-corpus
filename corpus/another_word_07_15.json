Why are you here? You should not have come here, what were you even thinking, this is all you packed to wear and now you\u2019re wearing it and it\u2019s not like you can get any other clothes on such short notice so this is just what you\u2019re stuck with and everyone is assuming this is the best you\u2019ve got. Oh Jesus, oh Jesus, you\u2019re here, it\u2019s happening.\n 2. Did you come here on a plane? Dang, you really committed, nice job! Try not to spend too much of the weekend anxiously wondering if that TSA employee thought you were rude when you took your boarding pass back when really you just wanted to make sure you got in a line that still had plastic tubs because waiting for plastic tubs while getting stinkeye from fellow passengers probably would have been worse than just giving possible accidental stinkeye to one TSA employee, but you\u2019re not sure. You\u2019ll never be sure. (If you drove, tell no one; you\u2019ll be hauling groups around like the first kid in your class with a driver\u2019s license.)\n 3. You don\u2019t know anybody here yet, but that\u2019s fine, it\u2019s cool. In movies people constantly go to bars alone and people come up and talk to them and they sip from drinks that never spill, so you have been doing your research on this for easily a decade. Make it thirty seconds before you pick up your phone; if you\u2019re feeling bold, find some other person who looks alone and vaguely panicked about it and say, \u201cDoes this taste poisoned to you?\u201d as a hilarious opening joke. Never, ever live it down. That TSA employee will seem like child\u2019s play after this.\n 4. You find people you know! You\u2019ll chat happily until people you don\u2019t know join the conversation, at which point you\u2019ll get so distracted trying to determine the existing relationships among everyone in the circle and whether or not you personally like the newcomers that you utterly lose track of the conversation and by the time you zone in again they\u2019ll have stopped talking about the book you love and are now talking about Firefly and you\u2019re left trying to decide if it\u2019s worth it to wait for things to cycle over to a new topic or just abandon them to Joss Whedon and start over from scratch.\n 5. You see three panels. The audience members are comment-not-question types, because of course they are, but you get some nice notes out of the main conversation because the panelists are all great.\n 6. Except on your panel, where the moderator opens with a question about why there\u2019s so much political correctness in the genre and two of the panelists nod firmly and this panel technically hasn\u2019t even started yet but here it is and this is how it\u2019s going to go and you are worried that if you reach for the water you\u2019ll knock it over so your voice just gets more and more smoked-out every time you lean into the mic and desperately try to counter the foolishness with something awesome that nobody listens to.\n 7. After the panel, someone might come up and thank you for your efforts. If you think this person seems cool, buy them a drink, because you\u2019ll both need one. Enjoy what you hope is this calm, respectful lull with a compatriot who won\u2019t say anything racist or sexist.\n 8. You\u2019re sharing a room? Awesome! Built-in breakfast buddy! Unless they have other plans. (It\u2019s probably nothing to do with you. Probably.) You know the rules of sharing a space\u2014don\u2019t use more than half the storage space, be quiet when you come home late, you\u2019ve got this. Try not to sit awake, listening to the pattern of their breathing, wondering if they\u2019re really asleep even though they have no reason to lie to you, or when they\u2019ll start snoring or\u2014oh my God, oh my God\u2014when they\u2019ll stop breathing and then someone you only vaguely know is dead in your hotel room and wow, will you ever look guilty. What are you going to do? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT YOUR DEAD BREAKFAST BUDDY?\n (Day one, it might worry you if they have different plans for breakfast. Day two you\u2019ll be so wiped from the parties that you won\u2019t even wake up until noon. By day three, you\u2019ll have barely fallen asleep after the parties and you still won\u2019t be sure how to move your facial muscles in socially-acceptable ways, so just plan to resort to the arm-sized menu they hang on your doorknob and get room service breakfast. It\u2019s more expensive than you can possibly afford, but at this point, being alone in the room is worth an eight dollar glass of juice.)\n 9. It\u2019s definitely creepy to try to find out where people you know are by using Twitter, and if you aren\u2019t sure whether or not real-time selfies are a map to their present location, better just to pretend you don\u2019t see them. Feel free to scan public areas, but there are places you can invite yourself and places you have to wait to be invited. Pool? Sure. Bar? Great. The Applebee\u2019s down the road? Godspeed their poor souls and let them be; Applebee\u2019s is its own punishment.\n 10. You\u2019ll end up eating at Applebee\u2019s at least twice.\n 11. Try to get six hours of sleep a night! (Who are we kidding, you\u2019ll get three. For every lost hour, add the cost of a cup of coffee. The last thing you need at this point is to be so tired you make another joke about poison, and it\u2019s not like you were going to come home from this thing with any money left anyway.)\n 12. Speaking of which: Is it already Saturday? Have you done any business? Welp, too late.\n 13. Find a weird place near the hotel\u2014the upper parking tier, the odd set of lawn chairs randomly on a patio next to the dumpsters\u2014and plan to hang out there alone at least once. When you inevitably need it, you will feel like you\u2019re heading for, instead of running from, and it will make a big difference in how you feel once you get there. Then let the symphony of industrial air conditioners wash over you.\n 14. The book room is amazing, and you won\u2019t regret a second of the time spent browsing there, if you can avoid being roped into awkward conversation by strangers. Can you? Well, you CAN, you\u2019ve seen spy movies. Will you blend in and become invisible? You\u2019ll find out.\n 15. If you and someone else really want to catch up, leave the premises. It\u2019s the only way to be sure you can be alone. Even then, consider splitting up and meeting at a prearranged location (you can do it, you\u2019ve been practicing spy stuff). If anyone sees you, you\u2019re doomed to a dinner for ten and two hours of small talk that erupts into an argument over the tip. Bet prearranging that location sounds less silly than it did a sentence ago.\n 16. Don\u2019t forget to make it to the airport at least three hours before your plane so you have plenty of time to worry about whether you left the kettle on at home/whether you\u2019ve ruined your reputation without having to do it in front of all the people in the security line.\n 17. You should go to more cons, though. They\u2019re crucial for your career.\n Genevieve Valentine is a novelist (her most recent is near-future political thriller Icon) and comic book writer, including Catwoman for DC Comics.

Lee\u2019s many worlds seem to multiply exponentially with each paragraph, and each turned page.\n There are soldiers and scientists, space travel and dragons, leather-bound books, locked doors, and genocidal rampages. Each tale strains at the edges of possibility. No two of Lee\u2019s stories are alike, except for a similar pulse powering each word, each juxtaposition, each startling turn of events.\n \u201cIt is not true that the dead cannot be folded,\u201d Lee writes in the opening paragraph of \u201cGhostweight.\u201d \u201cSquare becomes kite becomes swan; history becomes rumor becomes song. Even the act of remembrance creases the truth.\u201d\n There is immense beauty in Yoon Ha Lee\u2019s prose\u2014beauty enough to \u201cassassinate\u201d the reader, as she discusses below.\n \u201cThey are connoisseurs of writing in Imulai Mokarengen, the city whose name means inkblot of the gods.\u201d\n Lee has a connoisseur\u2019s reserve in terms of her online presence, but also a connoisseur\u2019s obsessive energy. She seems to turn each story in her hands for our delectation, angling it this way and that, offering us access in three dimensions. Though she has been publishing since the 90s, her stories have been more like intense lasers than sky-arcing spotlights.\n Below, Lee and I talk about style, stories, and the occasional assassination of a reader or two.\n How would you describe your style?\n I try to do two things with my style. The first is to pay attention to how the words sound together. When I read (silently), I hear everything in my head, almost as though I were reading it out loud. A story for me is all about sound and emotion. I don\u2019t get the movies-in-your-head that some readers report, though I wish I did; I can\u2019t visualize at all. So I have to work with the dimensions I have access to.\n The other thing is to juxtapose odd images. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t claim any artistry here. The truth is that I get bored easily, so I\u2019m entertaining myself. This one can get out of hand, and I have to be careful how I use it. I dialed it up in \u201cEffigy Nights,\u201d which has an ornate over-the-top space fantasy setting; ditto \u201cConservation of Shadows,\u201d where I wanted the focus to be on style and to evoke an almost poem-like feel because some of the inspiration was from \u201cThe Descent of Inanna.\u201d For other stories, too much of this sort of thing only distracts the reader from the action. It\u2019s a juggling act.\n Up until early high school, the people I wanted to write like, style-wise, were Simon R. Green (still one of my favorite authors) and Piers Anthony. I haven\u2019t read Anthony in a long time, although I remember him fondly, but both of them had clear, vigorous prose where I could follow what was going on very easily, and that\u2019s a trait I still admire. In high school, however, I encountered a Patricia McKillip that I didn\u2019t bounce off of (I tried the Riddle-Master books earlier and couldn\u2019t get into them), and Roger Zelazny. It had never occurred to me before McKillip and Zelazny that writing could be beautiful for its own sake. I wanted in, so I started practicing writing in that direction.\n How does a short story work on the reader? What should a short story do?\n I\u2019m going to preface this by saying that not all short stories are the same, I conveniently failed to major in English or literature and find literary theory confusing, and I\u2019m going to talk about how I do it, not how anyone else does or should do it.\n The whole point of a short story is to assassinate the reader. You don\u2019t have the time or the space to go to war or do large maneuvers, you can\u2019t do chapters of elaborate setup, there\u2019s much less room for character development\u2014a good writer can get more character development in, but that isn\u2019t my particular strength. Anyway, everything in the short story has to drive toward a short sharp point, whatever it is you\u2019re trying to leave the reader with at the end of the story.\n I say \u201cassassinate\u201d and it sounds hostile, because it is. I work better when I can think in terms of opponents. The thing is that I don\u2019t want the reader to see the short sharp point clearly from the beginning, but I want it to make sense afterward as the angle of attack. Tactical sense, I guess, in the context of the story\u2019s setup.\n Most of the time I write didactically, as if a short story were a proof. There is some object lesson, or ethical question, I want to leave the reader with. \u201dGhostweight\u201d is a good example of this; it doesn\u2019t pretend not to be didactic. So when I build the character and their strengths and weaknesses and motivations, when I build the setting, the majority of it needs to be in support of that point. With a proof, you want to include all the necessary axioms and arguments, but leave out the extraneous. A short story is very similar. I am not sure my math professors would approve of the use I am making of my college education, but there it is.\n Where does a short story begin for you\u2014character, setting, idea, somewhere else all together?\n Usually ideas or technical challenges. I see something ridiculous, or a combination of things that looks hard to do, and I want to do it. I\u2019m attracted to challenges. I hear all the time that you shouldn\u2019t write in second person, and I just laugh. My first sale, \u201cThe Hundredth Question,\u201d was in second person. I\u2019ve written in first person plural just for the hell of it (\u201cUnstringing the Bow\u201d). \u201dA Vector Alphabet of Interstellar Travel\u201d doesn\u2019t have characters, only civilizations, which was inspired by Italo Calvino\u2019s Invisible Cities. To be fair, there are a lot of stupid ideas out there, I generate my fair share of them, but there is no idea so stupid that a dedicated person can\u2019t make it work. You\u2019ll never know if you\u2019re that particular dedicated person unless you try.\n \u201cIseul\u2019s Lexicon\u201d started because I wanted to write about \u201ctactical linguistics\u201d and then had to make up a magic system that made the phrase meaningful. \u201dEffigy Nights\u201d started with an image of a paper girl being cut out and brought to life, with a side of using your stories to fight for your freedom in a very literal way. Sometimes the idea starts as a very vague image, and sometimes it\u2019s something specific; with \u201cThe Battle of Candle Arc\u201d I wanted to write space opera tactics and steal them off a famous Korean naval battle, the Battle of Myeongnyang. It all depends.\n Is there a story or stories in Conservation of Shadows that you consider a turning point or landmark story in your career?\n I don\u2019t think of my stories in those terms. Some are better than others, that\u2019s the nature of life, and each one has something that I\u2019d fix if I had it to do over now. Thankfully, no one is making me rewrite the lot; it\u2019s better just to take them one at a time, learn what there is to learn, and move forward.\n Unless you mean the first story where I allowed myself to use the F-word, in which case that\u2019s \u201cThe Battle of Candle Arc.\u201d This is not quite as stupid as it sounds! I was a teenager when I got my first story acceptance, and moreover I\u2019d gone to a Christian high school, so the idea of using, er, adult profanities took a while.\n Given the level of intensity in your stories, are you able to work on more than one at a time?\n I\u2019ve usually had some novel draft going at the same time as a short story, but I hate it. I vastly prefer to be working on one piece of fiction at a time because switching over fries my brain, especially when the stories are very different.\n I\u2019ve worked on up to three separate things at once and it usually makes me cry; I used to write tie-in game fiction for Alderac Entertainment Group\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, and one of the reasons I eventually left was the stress of the additional story-writing.\n Can you talk a little bit about where some of your characters come from? What goes into the character creation process?\n The hard part about character creation is that what I see on my end is very different from what I want the reader to get on their end. To me, a character is just a marionette. Especially for a short story, I just don\u2019t get attached to them. In general, I have some basic plot or conflict, and then I need the character to have certain traits to drive them through the story, so I build the character and, if applicable, culture/setting to facilitate that. I know I have confused beta readers in the past because I will change everything from appearance to gender if I decide it suits the story better. (This leads to odd gendered pronoun changes in some of my drafts when I fail to catch them all in revisions.)\n That all sounds dreadfully abstract, so let\u2019s take an example, Lisse from \u201cGhostweight.\u201d She\u2019s the protagonist, and this is a longer short story (at 8,000 words it might be technically something else, but who\u2019s counting), so I have a better chance of retaining the reader if she\u2019s at least sympathetic. I am personally happy to write horrible people, I frequently find it entertaining, but in this case I really did want the reader to care a little about Lisse. The end goal is for her to go on a genocidal rampage against the Imperium in revenge for her people\u2019s own genocide with the aid and encouragement of a ghost, only to discover that the ghost was partly responsible for the deaths of her people. She starts out deeply outnumbered since people like to root for underdogs and hell, this is a short, I don\u2019t have space for more characters. Some of the setup is already there in the endgame; having your own people almost wiped out is a strong motivation for someone to want to get revenge. She\u2019s emotionally dependent on the ghost because it sort of raised her (in its ghostly way), which makes it more believable that she\u2019s completely blindsided by the possibility that the ghost has its own agenda. By story\u2019s end she\u2019s responsible for an awful lot of deaths, and I could have made her completely monstrous, but she can still recognize what she\u2019s done if someone reframes the scenario for her. It\u2019s the fact that she remains capable of moral awareness that makes her maybe a little sympathetic even at the very end.\n What are some of the challenging parts of short fiction writing for you? And what comes more easily?\n I can\u2019t write short fiction with any great frequency, although I wish I could. But it\u2019s not all bad. Once I have the idea and a basic outline, I can turn out the words. I have bipolar disorder and one of the few useful things that has come out of it is that I now know dead certain that I can be depressed out of my mind and still turn out 250 words a day, or better, five days of the week. 250 words a day is not huge, but it is a hell of a lot better than 0; that\u2019s just basic math. Moreover, I have learned that if I set the goal low I will usually overshoot because I start wanting to write extra.\n I also struggle with this thing where you have to write stories that are comprehensible. I have this ridiculous irrational fear of writing stories that are too obvious. It\u2019s quite rare that someone says to me, \u201cYoon, everything in that story was too easy to understand\u201d! Whereas people will tell me that I have obfuscated too much. I need to get over my reluctance to explain things.\n On the plus side, I am much better at finishing stories than I used to be. Back in high school and college, I\u2019d just start writing an opening and stall out because I had no idea where I was going. These days I am smarter about how my brain works. I don\u2019t even commit to a story unless I know how it begins, how it ends, and have a rough idea of the plot in between. For me, knowing how the story ends is especially critical. Once I have that I can usually figure out the other stuff.\n Paragraph by paragraph, sentence by sentence, word by word, there\u2019s so much beauty in your prose. How much editing do you do and what sort of editing\u2014cutting, adding, small tweaks, major over-hauls?\n Oh, all of the above! Everything\u2019s fair game. Sometimes I write a rough and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s pretty clean, but if I have doubts I send for beta readers. I am grateful to all of mine. God knows I need them. My rough drafts are hilarious: enormous plot holes, characters dropping out, awkward phraseology, too much assonance, you name it. But that\u2019s fine. I like editing, because it means I\u2019m done with the damn rough and I can stop thinking about generating raw words and start thinking about making existing words work.\n What\u2019s next for you?\n I have been revising a space opera novel, because the desire of my heart is to write big space battles. Or even little space battles, I\u2019m not picky. I have a female captain who\u2019s been ordered to capture an impregnable space fortress and who is being advised by a four-hundred-year-old undead tactician who\u2019s out to get her, you know how that goes. I have no idea whether this will work out, but there\u2019s only one way to find out. Wish me luck!\n Any parting words?\n I have a daughter, and one of the things I never thought about when I started writing is what I would do about this situation, which is when my daughter comes up to me and wants to read what I\u2019m working on. She\u2019s young enough that most of my stories are not appropriate for her. I have had to say, \u201cThis story is not for little children!\u201d a lot of times! Of course, by the time she\u2019s old enough, she\u2019ll just find having a writer parent embarrassing. Anyway, it amuses me.\n Jeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

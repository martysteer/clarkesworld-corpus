As a result, it wasn\u2019t until I returned to Spain in my twenties that I really grasped the existence of Spanish science fiction as its own unique entity and proceeded to read original Spanish SF anthologies and novels. When I recently heard that Mariano Villareal, editor of the Terra Nova anthology series, was going to be working on Castles in Spain / Castillos en el Aire, a new Spanish-English bilingual anthology of Spanish science fiction, fantasy, and horror, I couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to speak with him and ask if he could help set up a roundtable with some of the anthology\u2019s contributors. Mariano was extremely helpful in connecting us across time zones and facilitating the conversation. And so I\u2019m going to let him introduce our roundtable members:\nElia Barcel\u00f3, prolific award-winning author of science fiction, fantasy and horror stories and novels, is the genre\u2019s foremost Spanish-language female writer.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed is the author of the short story collection El C\u00edrculo de Jeric\u00f3, the single most awarded book in the history of Spanish science fiction, as well as young adult novels, novels with historical settings, and Jules Verne-style adventures.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera is the award-winning co-author, along with Javier Redal, of Mundos en el Abismo and Hijos de la Eternidad, two canonical Spanish space operas; he is also a prolific illustrator, screenplay writer, and soon-to-be director.\nRafael Mar\u00edn, a scholar of science fiction and the history of comics, is the author of the novel L\u00e1grimas de Luz, considered a classic of modern Spanish science fiction, and several other key works.\nRodolfo Mart\u00ednez, the publisher of Sportula books, has written, among other things, cyberpunk, space opera, urban fantasy, Sherlock Holmes pastiches and alternate history secret agent romps, in the process earning the field\u2019s top Spanish awards.\nEduardo Vaquerizo, a prolific contributor to short story magazines and anthologies, is the author of Danza de Tinieblas and Memoria de Tinieblas, both of which won the Ignotus (the Spanish equivalent of the Hugo), as well as other well-regarded works richly informed by history.\nJavier Negrete, one of Spanish science fiction\u2019s premier stylists, is the author of several critically-acclaimed novels inspired by classical history and mythology, as well as La Espada de Fuego, the first in a bestselling epic fantasy series.\nI\u2019d like to start by asking you about your greatest literary influences.\nRodolfo Mart\u00ednez: They are many and they are quite varied. Authors like Robert Graves, Isaac Asimov, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, John Le Carr\u00e9, Philip K. Dick, J. R. R. Tolkien.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: The main ones for me would be Cort\u00e1zar and Borges. I admire them greatly. After that, I love many others, most of them science fiction writers: Le Guin, Bradbury, Lem, Ballard and others.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: Authors who are or have been influential in my writing: Ray Bradbury, Ursula K. Le Guin, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Stephen King, Philip K. Dick, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, Edgar Allan Poe, Leonard Cohen, and John Fowles. And many individual novels, poems and theater plays.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Non-genre writers: Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Vargas Llosa, Francisco Umbral. From within the field: Stephen King, Robert Howard.\nJavier Negrete: Honestly, it changes over time. Within science fiction, I like the imagination of Jack Vance, the speculative audacity of Vernor Vinge, Will McCarthy and Charles Sheffield, the style and character development of George R. R. Martin. I\u2019m also fascinated by Dan Simmons, whose Hyperion and Ilium sagas I have read and re-read. It\u2019s grand stuff, though at times so grand that it can be a bit exhausting.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: Many of my influences are North American, such as Ray Bradbury and Fredric Brown, but I could also name Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cort\u00e1zar.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, Larry Niven and Joe Haldeman.\nWhat is the most exciting thing happening in Spanish science fiction today (authors, movements, editors, etc.)?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I\u2019d say there are two exciting things going on. On the one hand, and little by little, science fiction is becoming more respectable. More mainstream readers and writers are coming to the genre, which for me is a positive thing. The second item is the growth of small publishers, combined with the presence of more writers. It\u2019s leading to an increased focus on the quality of Spanish science fiction.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: We\u2019re living through an implosion. Bad times aren\u2019t particularly exciting.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I don\u2019t follow Spanish science fiction as closely as I did twenty years ago, but I still try to read current novels and anthologies. It has become impossible to read everything, and that\u2019s good news, because it means that there are lots of new things.\nSome great developments are: Gigamesh and its big new bookshop, Lektu and the possibility of buying buys online at moderate prices, the Terra Nova anthologies and all the work Mariano Villarreal is doing, the existence of HispaCon, Sportula as a new publisher, and the new Random House imprint, Fantascy. And there are exciting new voices like Emilio Bueso, Ismael Mart\u00ednez Biurrun, Felicidad Mart\u00ednez, Sof\u00eda Rhei, Santiago Eximeno.\nRodolfo Mart\u00ednez: Perhaps the most exciting phenomenon is the appearance of many small publishers who are willing to bet on national authors.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: I would say that one exciting development is the increasing presence of women in our field. Recently I was talking with a friend who wrote a story for my next Akasa-Puspa anthology, and I told her that I thought her approach was fantastic, really innovative. I think female writers are going to help refashion the field.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: The single most important development is something Elia alluded to: there are more and better writers than ever before.\nLet\u2019s take a step back and talk about some Spanish publishing history. John W. Campbell is perhaps the single most influential editor in the history of English-language science fiction. Is there a Spanish John W. Campbell? Who were/are the most important Spanish science fiction editors?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I could name the people from Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n; Domingo Santos was the principal figure, and the magazine set the standard for science fiction in our country. But for me the single most influential editor was Francisco Porr\u00faa, who had a gigantic presence through the Minotauro publishing house and helped it deliver world-class science fiction. It\u2019s true that Porr\u00faa didn\u2019t publish Spanish writers in his collections, but I think his books opened many minds and led to careers whose goals were high-quality genre writing of literary merit.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: Domingo Santos and Luis Vigil can be considered, in my opinion, the two most influential science fiction editors in Spain. They started Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n and kept it going for two generations of readers; they opened the world of international science fiction to Spanish readers when Spain was a Third World country, a dictatorship where everything was forbidden. They introduced us to the great American and British writers who were still alive and writing wonders. They even published Russian stories! I really think science fiction exists in Spain because of them.\nLater, there were others, of course: Miquel Barcel\u00f3 (fanzine Kandama and then the Nova collection in Ediciones B., and the UPC Award), Alejo Cuervo (Mart\u00ednez Roca and then Gigamesh). Now Rodolfo Mart\u00ednez also works as an editor (Sportula). But Santos and Vigil were the old guard and we have lots to thank them for.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Domingo Santos, without a doubt. He was a writer, translator, and director of various collections throughout the 70s and 80s. It is to him that we owe the credibility gained by Spanish science fiction authors.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: As mentioned, I think the two most influential editors in Spain have been Domingo Santos, who among other things founded and co-managed the magazine Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n, and Francisco Porr\u00faa, creator and editor of the magnificent Minotaur collection. I\u2019d also like to mention Miquel Barcel\u00f3, who edited the Nova collection for Ediciones B.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: No question about it, our John W. Campbell\u2014at least my generation\u2019s\u2014was Domingo Santos. His work enabled the 90s generation to change the face of science fiction in Spain, and this is recognized with the Domingo Santos award, which is issued yearly. After Santos I\u2019d place Miquel Barcel\u00f3 as a critical editor in our history.\nThe Orbis Library of Science Fiction (1985-1987) collected one hundred titles, mostly translations of English-language science fiction classics, with a few Spanish novels mixed in. Domingo Santos helped curate the selection. How did this collection affect you personally, if it did? What did it do for science fiction in Spain?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: For me the Orbis collection was a kind of mental tin-opener. I was always interested in science and literature and had read Verne and Asimov, but until the Orbis Library came along I hadn\u2019t encountered the big names of English-language science fiction. The collection provided me with concentrated access to top writers. The result was discovery: new ways of thinking about the genre, from poetry to radical adventure, from social criticism to human conflicts. With the Orbis Library Domingo Santos did for novels what he had done for the short story with Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I am too old to have been really affected by this collection, excellent though it was. The one which really touched my mind, heart, and soul was the Nebulae series, which I had the good fortune to read in my hometown\u2019s public library when I was in my teens. Later, the publishers Orbis, Nova and Mart\u00ednez Roca helped me discover new writers and novels, but I was already hooked.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Yes, one hundred volumes of a collection primarily dedicated to American science fiction. My novel L\u00e1grimas de Luz appeared as volume sixty-five. An accomplishment and a surprise.\nJavier Negrete: I was twenty years old when the collection started, and my interest in science fiction was at its peak, so it was like a godsend. I bought the whole thing, of course, and read most of it. Thanks to Orbis, I discovered authors like Dick and Vance, with whom I\u2019d only been vaguely familiar. And that goes for Spanish authors too, like Berm\u00fadez Castillo\u2014I still remember how much I laughed reading Viaje a un Planeta Wu-Wei or El Se\u00f1or de la Rueda\u2014and Rafael Mar\u00edn, an author I would later befriend.\nI\u2019ve talked with my friends about this, and a lot of people got hooked on science fiction thanks to the collection\u2019s famous blue volumes. Some of these folks became loyal readers, and some went further and became writers. In my case, I was already writing at the time (I was working on the first draft of my novel La Espada de Fuego), but the Orbis collection sparked my imagination and fueled my creative energy.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: When this collection appeared in Spain I was already a big genre fan, familiar with almost every title that they included, so it didn\u2019t affect me much personally. But it was an extremely important collection in terms of disseminating science fiction among readers who barely knew it.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: A lot of the Orbis collection was based on the Ultramar collection, also spearheaded by Domingo Santos. The Orbis Library received more publicity and its impact abroad was larger, but here in Spain the Ultramar books, with their wonderful covers by Toni Garc\u00e9s, are held in higher regard, and I think my peers would agree that they marked the beginning of our Golden Age.\nOn that subject: It\u2019s been said that the Spanish Golden Age of science fiction occurred at the end of the 1990s. What was your involvement in that Golden Age, as writers and readers?\nElia Barcel\u00f3: My first story was published in 1980 and my first book in 1989, when I was already living in Austria. I\u2019ve been working in the field of science fiction ever since, though I must admit only part of my work can be considered science fiction because in the intervening years I have expanded into different literary genres.\nIn any case, 1992 was the moment when, for the first time, I got together with other Spanish science fiction writers in Barcelona, at a short event organized by BEM (the fanzine) that allowed us to meet Joe Haldeman and gave us three days to talk about our favorite literary genre. In the nineties the SF world in Spain seemed to bloom. It was one of these wonderful times when you feel everybody is doing his/her best to contribute. There were lots of fanzines and magazines, new possibilities for publishing, new writers with new ideas, Hispacon every year, the Asturcon in Gij\u00f3n (held the first weekend of the Semana Negra), the Semana Negra itself (which up to then had been a festival for crime literature), which allowed us to present our latest books, the UPC Award . . . It really was a great time.\nI was very active during that decade, although having two kids and not living in Spain didn\u2019t help, but I published three books and a dozen stories, won an Ignotus, contributed stories and articles to all the fanzines and magazines, compiled Visiones Propias II, the yearly anthology of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Fantas\u00eda y Ciencia Ficci\u00f3n, was guest of honor at a couple of conventions, translated stories from English and German into Spanish, presented lots of books of fellow writers in Gij\u00f3n, was on many panels, and so on. I was invited twice to Utopiales\u2014the great French Festival held in Nantes\u2014though that might have happened a bit later. Anyway, I was in touch with everybody, I tried to read everything that was being published and to help science fiction in Spain come into its own.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: I would say that our Golden Age started in the mid-80s, then there was a brief parenthesis at the start of the 90s, and it resumed from the early 90s through to the mid-00s.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: For me it was the start of the 90s, or, more precisely, with the publication of Domingo Santos\u2019 Ultramar collection at the end of the 80s. The first sign of the changes upon us was a novella by Rafael Mar\u00edn, \u201cNunca digas buenas noches a un extra\u00f1o,\u201d which was published in the magazine Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n. At the time I didn\u2019t know Rafael, but I remember thinking that that story was something new, unlike anything that had been published in Spain before. Later the novel L\u00e1grimas de Luz appeared, also by Rafael. The 1987 novel I wrote with Javier Redal, Mundos en el Abismo, is considered by many to be one of the defining moments in the formation of Spanish science fiction as we know it today.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I think that literature, as any art, happens in short bursts or waves that combine passion with state-of-the-art craftsmanship. The thing is that in the 90s large groups of young people fell deeply in love with the science fiction and fantasy that was being published in Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n, along with the Orbis and Minotauro publishing imprints. We were baby boomers, a generation of youngsters who had grown up reading Verne, Wells, Asimov, Clarke, Sturgeon, Le Guin, Lem, Bradbury, Ballard, Dick and many others. There weren\u2019t a lot of us, but we organized gatherings, usually at cheap Chinese restaurants, where we talked and ate and drank a lot.\nWe were enthusiastic conversationalists. At these gatherings there would almost always be a publisher present, or someone who produced a fanzine, or perhaps someone who hosted a radio talk show about science fiction and fantasy. We were a hardcore, very active group of fans. I think that was the secret: we were competing, judging each other\u2019s works passionately, and publishing in small, even non-professional markets. But these markets turned out to be a good training ground, and they were quite professional regarding the selection of stories and the editing of fiction. Another powerful lever was the literary prizes, the only way to obtain some money writing science fiction and fantasy for us at the time.\nThe result was a noticeable rise in quality and in the number of active writers. The changes in the 90s happened as a result of the work done by previous genre fans. They paved the way for us. I\u2019d like to believe that in the 90s we similarly paved the way for newer writers who are flourishing today.\nJavier Negrete: I\u2019m a bit skeptical about \u201cGolden Age\u201d labels, as well as those that allegedly define literary generations. That being said, the 90s wasn\u2019t a bad time for science fiction. The UPC award, with its shortcomings\u2014like paying inordinate attention to foreign authors, suggesting an attitude of deference\u2014was really important in getting young or not-so-young authors to write short novels like crazy. The short novel, or novella, is an interesting form, because it forces the author to condense full plots and compelling characters into a small space, and that kind of discipline helps a writer grow.\nConventions like those of C\u00e1diz, Burjassot and Gij\u00f3n helped diverse authors meet in person. Besides leading to friendships, many of which continue to this day, the cons allowed for an exchange of ideas, projects, dreams . . . An interesting period, to be sure.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: I was one of the writers that formed the 90s generation we\u2019ve been discussing, so my involvement was significant. Nevertheless, at that time we didn\u2019t have any \u201cgenerational awareness\u201d whatsoever. We simply wrote what we wanted to write, though we did notice that we were living in a period of great creative stirrings. It was beautiful.\nIn his 2007 survey of the history of Spanish science fiction (\u201cNotas para una historia de la ciencia ficci\u00f3n en Espa\u00f1a\u201d), Fernando \u00c1ngel Moreno Serrano writes that the 90s saw a growing appreciation for the \u201cimportance of language.\u201d Agree/disagree? How important is this awareness today?\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Writers and readers in the 70s were used to reading translations, in some cases very poor ones. Writers like me who arrived on the scene in the 80s read more mainstream novels by Spanish or South American writers. That influenced our style. Now we write knowing that form and language are important.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: Until the 90s the few science fiction writers who published in our country were, in general, fans, happy to contribute but somewhat limited from a literary perspective. In the 90s a new generation appeared, better equipped with literary technique, and that was visible in the quality of the texts. Science fiction is, above all, literature, so the importance language is fundamental. That notion continues to be in play today.\nJavier Negrete: Yes, I think that in the 90s several authors appeared who, without sacrificing story or plot, paid greater attention to the use of language than in previous decades. Of course, all generalizations are unfair: a writer like Berm\u00fadez Castillo had already written brilliantly.\nI suppose the cause of the improvement was that by this time there were more people writing science fiction than before. And with a greater base of writers, it makes sense that even in a statistical way there should be a rising number of authors with a heightened sense of style (I\u2019m thinking of Rafael Mar\u00edn and Le\u00f3n Arsenal) as well as more efficient storytellers who didn\u2019t sacrifice quality (like Juan Miguel Aguilera, C\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed o Rodolfo Mart\u00ednez).\nThe same seems to be happening now with authors who emerged after the year 2000. Some of them, like Emilio Bueso, have very well-developed and personal styles, while others like Virginia P\u00e9rez create a lot of tension and immediacy\u2014these are just a few examples, of course there are many others. And there\u2019s a great many authors who despite their best intentions don\u2019t reach a quality of craft that I would consider professional. Which is to say, the same situation as twenty years ago. And you see it in other genres too, as confirmed by my experience as a judge for various young adult and historical novel awards.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I agree. As I said before, thanks to the new wave of Orbis and Minotauro people in the 90s read a lot of new science fiction writers. And we read other things too\u2014other genres, literature in our mother tongue, classics of world literature. Our interest was in literature first and foremost; with science fiction as a special case, unlike more conservative academics and mainstream writers who argue that literature and science fiction are distinct. Science fiction and fantasy are the literature of the marvelous. Literature is created through language, so of course we became interested in language. Writers must hone their artistic and communicative intentions and abilities to push language beyond its formals limits.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: Moreno Serrano is quite right, in my opinion, but I think this awareness had already formed in the mid-eighties, especially with writers like Rafael Mar\u00edn, C\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed and myself, all three of us coming not from \u201cscientific\u201d studies but from an academic training in the humanities.\nUp to 1980, the average science fiction reader read only science fiction and lacked any (or almost any) knowledge of classical or mainstream literature. Most of the novels he had read\u2014I say \u201che\u201d because the typical science fiction reader at the time was male\u2014were badly translated American novels by translators who couldn\u2019t even write good Spanish prose. With this \u201cschool,\u201d the few Spanish genre writers used to focus on story, idea, usually a simple plot. Style wasn\u2019t a consideration.\nWhen our generation started to write, many of us had university training and a few of us had majored in philology or history. We had read the classics, the great poets, and modern Latin American authors (Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Vargas Llosa, Cort\u00e1zar, Borges, etc.). Some of us could also read texts in different languages and were not forced to rely on the terrible translations that were typical of the genre.\nWe developed an awareness of the language we were using and not only that: we became aware that, when writing science fiction, we were writing literary texts. Ideas are important and plot is important, as are all elements in a story or novel, but in literature the core is language: its richness, its appropriateness, the way it is used to convey emotions, ideas, feelings . . . But at that time we had to fight against readers (and publishers, \u201ccritics,\u201d etc.) who didn\u2019t see the importance of writing \u201cwell.\u201d\nI think this awareness is still present today and most young writers know you can only write a good novel if you can use language as a writer, if you\u2019re writing literature. But I also fear that this awareness might disappear in the near future because nowadays anybody can write anything, put it on the Internet and hope it is read by thousands who don\u2019t care if it is literature or not.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: I completely agree with the observation. Rafael Mar\u00edn, Elia Barcel\u00f3, Rodolfo Mart\u00ednez, Javier Negrete, and I, part of the 90s generation, understood that good ideas weren\u2019t enough to write science fiction novels or short stories. The way in which a story is told is as important as the idea. In the end science fiction is a literary genre and there are no excuses for bad writing.\nIn the essay \u201cScience Fiction from Spain\u201d Mariano Villareal observes that one out of ten new genre releases in Spain is written by a woman. Why are there so few women in Spanish science fiction? Do you see this changing anytime soon?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: At least there is one in this conversation (Elia). I remember my first fan days, my first conventions. There was always was a panel titled \u201cWomen and Science Fiction.\u201d These days, women are becoming more interested in science fiction in Spain, because they are taking on more active roles in Spanish society. But yes, there is still a lot of room for improvement.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: This is one of the most frequently asked questions in Spanish science fiction and one without a clear answer. One often hears that the name of the genre has made girls think science fiction is primarily about science and they have the idea that science is not a girls\u2019 domain. But I don\u2019t really think so, because there are lots of women scientists in Spain, which means that there are lots of women interested in science. But apparently not in fiction or in the mixture of both.\nLike most mainstream readers, women do not generally read science fiction and this means that when women readers get to the point when they want to become writers, they write what they usually read: mainstream, crime, mystery, historical novels, romance, etc.\nI was lucky enough to be a science fiction reader from the start, and not only that, I had the good fortune of discovering the great women writers of the United States in my youth: Ursula K. Le Guin, James Tiptree, Jr., Joanna Russ, Marion Zimmer Bradley, later Connie Willis. They were amazing! Much more importantly, I didn\u2019t have to be an engineer or an astrophysicist to do it. I could write science fiction with my imagination, my heart, my use of language and any knowledge I might possess about the world.\nNowadays I have the impression that more women are having this kind of experience and getting to write science fiction. But this is only something you do when you are deeply in love with the genre; if that\u2019s not the case, as a young inexperienced writer you try to get as many readers as possible, you want your first novel to be a success and make lots of money . . . and that is not usually true for science fiction, so you try to do something more like El Tiempo Entre Costuras \ud83d\ude42\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: The same thing was true in the United States, for example during the Golden Age. In the beginning science fiction had a predominantly male readership. Pulp covers, after all, would show BEMs kidnapping beautiful girls who were scantily clad, rather than hot semi-naked young men. Modern science fiction reached Spain in the 50s, so we\u2019re behind when it comes to being more inclusive of women in the genre. But slowly and surely the situation is improving and each year there are more female readers and writers. In fact, one of the best Spanish science fiction writers is a woman\u2014Elia.\nJavier Negrete: I don\u2019t know the reason, so I can only guess. As a professor, I\u2019ve noticed that more women tend to study humanities than sciences, and in some way\u2014even if it\u2019s just because of the name\u2014they tend to associate science fiction with science. Maybe that\u2019s why the young female writers I know tend to gravitate more towards fantasy than science fiction, or even historical novels, which is also I genre I work in. Will the situation change? I\u2019m not sure. In a way, I\u2019m not sure it needs to: every writer, male or female, should be free to choose whatever genre they like best and to fashion whatever fictional worlds they want.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: Fortunately the situation is changing. As I see it, the most interesting stories in the two anthologies set in my Akasa-Puspa universe are written by women. I\u2019ve always believed that female writers bring a new, fresh perspective to science fiction, something that hasn\u2019t happened in Spain but which is now\u2014perhaps because of the influence of female fantasy writers\u2014underway. My third Akasa-Puspa anthology will feature an even greater number of women.\nWhat impact has the Spanish financial crisis had on science fiction in Spain, besides reducing publishing?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I think that we have lived through several intermixed crises. The publishing crisis is a paradigm shift crisis. We are at the start of an all-digital world, but we\u2019re lacking the industrial and cultural knowledge to sustain this new direction. Technology has developed more quickly than society has, and now we have new ways of distributing literature without a support system in place, a way to make it economically sustainable. Music has experienced a similar crisis, as well as cinema, and, with 3D printers, the manufacturing industry will be next.\nIn Spain, I think that the financial crisis has led people to read more, not less, looking for distraction and, perhaps, insight. They read more but don\u2019t pay for what they read, because the system has not adapted to the new paradigm.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m qualified to answer this question; I live too far away to be aware of everyday life in Spain. The only thing that comes to mind\u2014and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s really related to the crisis or to the general state of the world\u2014is the abundance of dystopias we are reading and writing of late. There seems to be a sort of \u201cend of times\u201d feeling that promotes the writing of dark futures full of destruction, ecological chaos, etc. Optimism and a belief in science are things of the past.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: Yes, I think the main impact can be seen in the themes writers choose, often laden with pessimism. Nowadays dystopias and catastrophes are thriving.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: The crisis has returned us to the place where we started. Publishers have cut down their publications enormously. A new phenomenon has arisen, that of the fan who self-edits his work and seeks crowd-funding. Or small publishers. There are more people writing, there are lots of small publishers, but we\u2019ve lost some quality along the way, and the chance to chance a wider audience.\nJavier Negrete: The combination of the crisis with internet piracy and new pastimes is proving to be devastating for the publishing world and for writers. Midlist authors have practically vanished. And that\u2019s true in SF as well as other genres. Will we bounce back? I\u2019m not sure.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: The first impact was that a lot of readers ran away to fantasy, a more escapist genre. Maybe the crisis made it harder to believe in the future, or real life was deemed depressing enough. But now the opposite is happening and dystopias are proving the most successful subgenre. The most recent anthology to which I contributed is Ma\u00f1ana Todav\u00eda (edited by Ricard Ruiz Garz\u00f3n and published by Fantascy) and it deals with dystopias from the point of view of very different writers, like Rosa Montero, Elia Barcel\u00f3, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Merino, Javier Negrete, and me. It\u2019s doing very well.\nIf I wanted to read the best Spanish science fiction short stories, where would be a good place to start?\nElia Barcel\u00f3: There are a couple of people you could ask: Juli\u00e1n D\u00edaz, Juan Manuel Santiago, Fernando \u00c1ngel Moreno, Santiago Solans, Rudy Mart\u00ednez and, of course, Mariano Villarreal. They have probably read every SF short story ever published in Spain. I would also recommend the stories published in Artifex and now in Terra Nova. There are also lots of them\u2014very good ones\u2014in forgotten magazines and fanzines, and in Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n if you wanted to start at the beginning.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: The Nueva Dimensi\u00f3n magazines, for older stories, and the fanzines edited in the 90s. The problem, though, is that these are almost impossible to find. Recently the publisher Cyberdark has started a collection of anthologies whose goal is to rescue the best short stories of this period. Cyberdark published an anthology called Dulces Diecis\u00e9is with my strongest short fiction of the 90s, along with another volume called El Noveno Cap\u00edtulo that collected some of Armando Boix\u2019s best stories. They\u2019re planning to edit about twenty more anthologies covering that time. It\u2019s a great idea to make these stories available again.\nOf course, there\u2019s also more recent short fiction that\u2019s very good, but it\u2019s pretty easy to find. The logical starting point would be the Internet. There are also several interesting themed anthologies containing strong recent work by current writers as well.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Yes, there are good anthologies and author collections out there. Anthologies depend a lot on the tastes and biases of their editors. I think author collections are better at showcasing what writers are capable of, so I prefer collections.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: There are two more-or-less recent books that offer an interesting panorama of Spanish science fiction short stories: Prospectivas (Salto de P\u00e1gina, 2012), edited by Fernando \u00c1ngel Moreno, and Historia y Antolog\u00eda de la Ciencia Ficci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (C\u00e1tedra, 2014), edited by Juli\u00e1n D\u00edez and Fernando \u00c1ngel Moreno.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: We\u2019re all very different, so it really depends on what kind of SF subgenre you enjoy. Since we\u2019ve talked about women and science fiction, I\u2019d recommend the story \u201cLa textura de las palabras\u201d by Felicidad Mart\u00ednez, which is set in my Akasa-Puspa universe, and which is so original in its approach that it astounded me. I\u2019d also recommend the anthology we mentioned before, Ma\u00f1ana Todav\u00eda, in which you\u2019ll find just about every author who is currently relevant in Spanish science fiction.\nDo you think Spanish science fiction has been more influenced by U.S. or European (including U.K.) authors and works?\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: At one point U.S. science fiction dominated the Spanish scene completely. But since the 90s I\u2019d say we\u2019ve been finding our own voice. I\u2019m interested in French science fiction\u2014all of my novels appear in France, sometimes even before they do in Spain, and I know a lot of French authors, who unfortunately aren\u2019t as popular in Spain as they ought to be.\nJavier Negrete: In my case, I\u2019ve read a lot of U.S. science fiction, some U.K. stuff and a little from the rest of Europe. I think that\u2019s been mostly due to availability. So yes, I suppose the U.S. has exerted the most influence. I tend to like English-language literature in general, not only science fiction but other genres.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: I concur, the United States has influenced Spanish SF the most, and then the U.K. in second place. Fortunately, one of the accomplishments of the 90s generation we\u2019ve been discussing was to put that influence to good use and adapt its best elements towards the sensibilities and realities of Spain.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I think that English science fiction\u2014and I\u2019m not separating between British and North American here\u2014led the genre for years. There are a lot of great writers and some masters. That was the principal influence in Spain, but the European tradition has also played a part. For me, for example, Stanislaw Lem was very important. And of course we shouldn\u2019t forget Jules Verne.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: Science fiction in Spain has been until recently (and probably it still is, though not so strongly) a branch of English-language science fiction that is science fiction originally written in English. The influence of French, Russian, Italian, German, Polish or Scandinavian science fiction is insignificant compared to the influence of North American and British authors.\nThe greatest influence is probably American, although in the 90s the influence of the British New Thing was important too.\nUntil 2012 the Ignotus prize, an important Spanish science fiction award, was voted on by members of the Spanish Association of Fantasy, Science Fiction, and Horror (AEFCFT) and by HispaCon attendees. Now anyone can register and vote. What prompted this change? Do you think the Hugo awards should similarly be opened up beyond Worldcon members?\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: I\u2019m actually the Spanish writer to have won the most Ignotus awards in the history of Spanish science fiction, as writer and illustrator. It is quite prestigious and particularly helpful when you\u2019re starting out. Making the voting process accessible to more people has perhaps been a move to increase the number of voters, to make things more democratic. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s good or not; we\u2019ll see during the next award season!\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I have not given much thought to the question because I don\u2019t really believe in such things\u2014especially now, with so many ways of influencing the voters\u2019 opinions and the sudden fashions that lead people to vote for this or that just because everybody is talking about it on Twitter.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: Yes, the idea was to obtain more votes, which should in turn make the Ignotus more representative of what people like, more universal in a way. I don\u2019t think the Hugos have this problem because Worldcon fandom is larger. An open voting process could make the prize less specialized, which might be good or bad according to one\u2019s preference. Would you prefer winners who are more famous\u2014more bestsellers maybe, more mainstream writers\u2014or not?\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: As the others have pointed out, I suppose that the reason for the change in the way the Ignotus is selected was the low number of Association members. Regarding the question of the Hugos . . . I\u2019m not sure, to be honest. Worldcon has a lot of members, so it may already represent the general opinion of fans. I don\u2019t think a change is necessary, but I also wouldn\u2019t really see any downside to it.\nWhat single work of Spanish science fiction would you most like to see translated into other languages (including English)?\nRodolfo Mart\u00ednez: Definitely Viaje a un Planeta Wu-Wei by Gabriel Berm\u00fadez Castillo.\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I think the best way to show what Spain has to offer is to translate a dozen (or twenty) stories and providing a panorama of different styles and ways of thinking. All of the authors mentioned in these conversations have very interesting visions to share with non-Spanish readers. And, of course, if I do say so myself, my trilogy Anima Mundi might be a candidate for translation.\nEduardo Vaquerizo: I\u2019ll be honest and say that I\u2019d like my own steampunk imperial adventure, Danza de Tinieblas, published in English. Also, El Ciclo de la Luna Roja by Jose Antonio Cotrina (a trilogy), Seis by Daniel Mares, Mundos en el Abismo by Juan Miguel Aguilera and Javier Redal, Consecuencias Naturales by Elia Barcel\u00f3, and Alejandro Magno y las \u00c1guilas de Roma by J. Negrete.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: Would it be rude to suggest my own work?\nJavier Negrete: I\u2019d suggest my Tram\u00f3rea saga (one has to self-promote, after all), and I\u2019d also pick Mundos en el Abismo by Aguilera and Redal. It\u2019s already been translated into other languages, but not English, and I think it would work well in the U.K./U.S. markets.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: As it happens, a few years ago one of my novels was mentioned on the Locus blog in this context. My 1998 novel La Locura de Dios was quoted as being the winner of the Somebody-Please-Translate Award. So I\u2019m going to listen to the author of that piece pick the same novel for translation into English. It\u2019s already been translated into other languages, by the way; it won the Imaginales award in France and the Bob Morane award in Belgium.\nWhat are your current and forthcoming projects?\nEduardo Vaquerizo: In June Random House, through its Fantascy imprint, will publish my novel Nos Mienten, written in the mood of political turmoil in which we live in Spain today. I\u2019m currently writing a prequel to Danza de Tinieblas, my steampunk uchronia about a Spanish empire that survives into the present. The jonbar point occurs in the 16th century, following a war of succession caused by the death of Felipe II in a hunting accident. It was a very ambitious project because of the richness of the real Spanish Renaissance, mixed with the steampunk and uchronia propositions. I hope to have the prequel finished in half a year or so.\nAfter that, I\u2019m considering writing a techno-thriller about big transport airplanes. But that\u2019s just one of several possible ideas . . .\nElia Barcel\u00f3: I just finished writing a science fiction trilogy, Anima Mundi, which is a sort of crossover/hybrid novel for readers of all ages. It starts as a kind of love story for young people and gets darker and darker and more science-fictional with every page. The third part, Hijos de las Estrellas, will be published at the end of March.\nI\u2019ve started writing a dystopia with a strong gender theme, but there is another (mainstream) novel competing for my attention and I still don\u2019t know which one will get written first.\nI\u2019ve almost finished compiling a collection of my short stories (in different genres), and that will be probably published before the summer.\nFinally, I\u2019ll be participating in two forthcoming SF anthologies with two short stories. One is finished, the other still in my mind.\nRafael Mar\u00edn: I\u2019m writing a historical novel. Adventures in the 16th century.\nRodolfo Mart\u00ednez: I\u2019m finishing La Sombra del Adepto, the fourth novel in a sequence that started with El Adepto de la Reina in 2009. I\u2019m also working on a novel that takes as its starting point my short story \u201cEn el \u00c1tico,\u201d which appeared in the anthology Ma\u00f1ana Todav\u00eda. And in the not-too-distant future I\u2019d like to return to my Encrucijada series: police stories in a pseudo-Roman setting.\nJavier Negrete: I\u2019m currently continuing the history of Rome which I began in Roma Victoriosa and continued in Roma Invicta. I can\u2019t talk about other projects I\u2019m working on right now, but I hope to return to science fiction, which continues to be my favorite genre.\nC\u00e9sar Mallorqu\u00ed: In September of 2015 a new collection of my fantasy and short stories will appear, Trece Monos, published by Random House. Right now I\u2019m working on a young adult novel, still untitled, which\u2014remember the pessimism we were talking about before?\u2014chronicles the life story of three brothers during the collapse of civilization.\nJuan Miguel Aguilera: In addition to my new Akasa-Puspa anthology, which I\u2019ve already mentioned, I\u2019m working on the script of a science fiction movie called Mindgate, which will be filmed in the U.S. The protagonist will be played by Rachael Leigh Cook. This will be my second film; my first was Stranded. However, this time I\u2019ll be directing as well.\nNote: A special thank you to Alicia Amaro, who helped with the translation.\nAlvaro is the co-author, with Robert Silverberg, of When the Blue Shift Comes, which received a starred review from Library Journal.

He was three years older than me, the ranking officer in this humble little space station, commanding exactly one subordinate, one of the top mechanical grapple operators in orbit, Lil\u2019 Zhang\u2014that\u2019s me. Hearing the name Zixuan, you\u2019ll likely picture some fresh-faced pretty-boy with rosy lips and perfect teeth, but no such luck, he was an old-school Beijing Bloke. You couldn\u2019t call him beefy, quite, but he didn\u2019t leave you room for daydreams.\nFortunately, though, Old Liu had a lively mind\u2014you rarely got bored talking to him. He chatted about Beijing with me all the time: the fermented mung bean milk of Tiantankou, the chitterling stew of Ping\u2019anli, the birds of the Summer Palace, the fish of Goldfish Pool. He liked to say that outer space gave him too much of a stuffy feeling, so he needed to air out his memories of his homeland on the regular to do a good job at work. Under his subtle influence, I developed a bit of a hankering for the Beijing life too.\n\u201cKeeping a bird? What\u2019s a layabout without any practical know-how like you doing, thinking about that?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cSee for yourself,\u201d I drawled, and tossed the tablet to him. The tablet screen displayed a short story titled \u201cFeathered Friend,\u201d by Arthur C. Clarke. The story was straightforward\u2014a crew member on a space station was secretly keeping a canary, in a minor breach of regulations. But no one could have guessed that an accident would send the space station\u2019s oxygen levels plummeting, while the alarm system happened to break down at the same time. In this dangerous situation, the canary reacted first and passed out, alerting the crew and ultimately saving all their lives.\nI fully trusted the air circulation system in the space station, and I\u2019d never properly tried to care for a pet before. But I wouldn\u2019t mind adding an adorable little backup to the space station, especially when it wouldn\u2019t cost us much of anything.\nOld Liu soon finished reading the story. He was quiet for a moment, chin in hand, then said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know, if you\u2019ve never done it before?\u201d\n\u201cSimple. In space, birds can\u2019t eliminate waste. They\u2019re not like humans\u2014they don\u2019t have separate urethrae and anuses, just a cloaca where urine and feces come out together. You wouldn\u2019t want questionable white fluids floating everywhere in the space station, would you?\u201d\n\u201cUrk . . . \u201d My stomach turned when I considered it.\n\u201cMore importantly, birds can\u2019t voluntarily control their waste elimination. It\u2019s fine on Earth where gravity helps out\u2014makes the waste drop like a bomb from a plane, fwish! But in a zero-gravity environment, the bird can\u2019t eliminate waste. The little thing\u2019s going to clog to death on its own crap and piss.\u201d\nI had to admit, he made a vivid analogy. I immediately thought of the aerial bombers newly added to our country\u2019s military. They really did need a rail launcher to properly toss out the missiles.\n\u201cFine, I admit you\u2019ve got a point . . . \u201d I shrugged. \u201cYou really did put all your skill points into this kind of random trivia!\u201d\n\u201cHah. What Beijing Bloke wouldn\u2019t know how to care for flower, fish, and fowl?\u201d he returned.\nAt that point, a dispatch from the Tiangong main station interrupted our conversation. He waved the tablet, indicating that I should take it.\n\u201cHello? Are you there, Lil\u2019 Zhang? You guys might be getting work to do.\u201d\n\u201cSpace Station B5-H35 here, message received. Main Station, what\u2019s the situation?\u201d I answered.\n\u201cLidar detected some weird little thingies. No danger of collision with you guys, but they\u2019re not supposed to be there. You guys should take a look.\u201d\n\u201cThingies? Where?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re probably military satellites launched during the Cold War. Couldn\u2019t find anything on them in the database. I\u2019ll send you the monitoring data. If you look out from the observation dome, toward Tianque, you\u2019ll see it within plus or minus ten degrees.\u201d\nI grabbed the telescope and directed my gaze toward Tianque\u2014the wreckage of a large-scale space station. Two years ago, a meteor had struck Tianque while it was still in the process of construction, snapping the main axle into three pieces; not only was repair impossible, the collision had produced a large amount of space junk. As a result, not many people ventured into this region of space even now. It had even proved troublesome for our space station, preventing us from expanding our operations. Part of the daily routine for me and Old Liu in this beat-up little space station was monitoring the movement of this wreck.\nBut today, something really had changed within the environs of Tianque. In my field of vision, about three degrees southwest of the wreck, a formation of little bright dots had appeared. They were extremely close to us, their relative velocity near zero. Even against the glittering backdrop of the Milky Way, they were clearly visible, like silver chains floating in the void. And obviously, if they were moving along an orbit, they couldn\u2019t be a meteor shower.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got visual confirmation. Data received. I\u2019ll try to grab one,\u201d I answered.\n\u201cRoger that. Thanks for your work.\u201d The Tiangong main station cut off the transmission.\nIt might sound hard, operating a cable-controlled grapple with three axes of movement to grab a small satellite, but I\u2019m an old hand. I aimed the microwave radar toward the flashing dots. Soon, the screen indicated that the chains of lights were in fact twelve little CubeSat satellites arrayed in a three by four formation along the same orbital path, advancing in equally spaced ranks as if fastened together by a giant invisible net. At the same time, the computer gave me the time at which they\u2019d be closest to us, approximately one hour later. I sat myself in the operating cabin, made my adjustments, then struck up a conversation with Old Liu.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen satellites in such a tight formation. Old Liu, you\u2019ve got lots of experience. Have you seen anything like this?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t. It kind of looks like when you send multiple satellites up on the same rocket, before the payload has had a chance to disperse through orbital maneuvers.\u201d He craned his neck to take a look, then shook his head. \u201cBut any launch that\u2019s gotten to this stage should be complete. This looks more like . . . someone created this formation on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . who\u2019d be bored enough to do something like that?\u201d I told him, \u201cWe have a tiny window of opportunity this time, only enough for me to fetch one back. How about you take a guess what\u2019ll be in it?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wanted to keep a bird up here in space? Maybe you\u2019ll pick up a canary,\u201d Old Liu ribbed me, shrugging his shoulders.\n\u201cHah.\u201d With that, I returned my attention to the observation platform.\nThere\u2019s not much to say about the process of grappling on to a target. You just steer the grappling hook into the target\u2019s orbital path, fire off the RCS thrusters a couple dozen times to cut down on your velocity relative to the target, wait for it to \u201cbump\u201d into the hook, clamp down, and reel the cable back in. Other than the three axes of movement and the zero-gravity environment, it\u2019s not fundamentally different from operating an arcade claw machine. Because whichever satellite I grabbed would be followed by more satellites on the same orbital path, I decided to get the front-most satellite. To avoid a collision, I had to reel the cable in quickly, but it didn\u2019t add too much hassle to the task. Soon, we had the strange CubeSat inside the hold of the space station.\n\u201cIs this some kind of joke?\u201d I said. The object in front of me could barely be called a satellite. The cube was a little smaller all around than even a standard 10 x 10 x 10 cm CubeSat, without any visible sensor components on its surface. It was assembled from six sheets of galvanized iron bolted together\u2014some of the screws hadn\u2019t been tightened properly, the nuts gone missing without a trace. Its crudeness put the shoddiest of Soviet manufacturing to shame.\nBut Old Liu was in high spirits. \u201cEither way, let\u2019s take a look at the payload first.\u201d He unscrewed the top with practiced movements and lifted it away. Unexpectedly, the moment the box was opened, a cloud of icy vapor boiled out of the container, forming a layer of frost over my goggles and skin. Startled, I backed away on instinct, only to lose my balance and start spinning in the middle of the space station. When Old Liu finally grabbed and steadied me, and I\u2019d recovered from my shock, I at last discovered the real face of the payload\u2014some foam, clearly used for shock absorption, and a crystal-clear ecosystem sphere steaming with cold. The water inside it had completely frozen. Through it, I could see a fish frozen inside the ice.\n\u201cOld Liu . . . what is this sphere?\u201d My voice shook a little. I turned toward Old Liu, only to find him goggling as well. It took a while before he cleared his throat and came up to put his arm around the sphere.\n\u201cEr, scientifically speaking, this ought to be a frozen ecosystem sphere. It looks like there\u2019s a carp and some vegetation embedded in the ice.\u201d He hefted the glass sphere and added, \u201cIt feels about five kilos.\u201d\n\u201cSure, but I want to ask . . . why would this thing end up in orbit?\u201d\nIn this instant, possibilities swam through my mind. What kind of person would take a five-kilogram ecosystem sphere thousands of miles up into outer space, then toss it outside to drift in orbit? What would their purpose be?\nDong!\nOld Liu gave a hard rap on my spacesuit, bringing me to reality. \u201cDon\u2019t woolgather, take a close look at this.\u201d\nI responded belatedly, picking up the ecosystem sphere and inspecting it closely. Only then did I discover that the ice in the sphere looked a lot clearer than normal ice. There was hardly any distortion; I could even clearly see the patterns on the carp.\n\u201cIt looks like the kind of crystal structure produced by flash freezing . . . \u201d Old Liu chipped off a bit of ice and examined it under the microscope. After a while, he suddenly remarked, \u201cLil\u2019 Zhang, we can\u2019t keep a bird, but do you want to keep a fish?\u201d\n\u201cKeep a fish?\u201d I looked at the sphere of ice in Old Liu\u2019s hand, which showed no signs of thawing, and asked, dubiously, \u201cThis fish? It\u2019s been frozen into a lump. How are we supposed to keep it?\u201d\n\u201cHaha, ye of little knowledge. If my guess is correct, before this ecosystem sphere was tossed into space, it was first flash frozen with liquid nitrogen. With an animal as hardy as a carp, supercooling temperatures will only freeze it on the outside, forming a hard shell, but it won\u2019t damage the circulatory system. The ice shell would even help it survive the g-forces of a rocket launch. In other words, if we toss it into water to defrost, it\u2019ll soon be alive and kicking, guaranteed.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . even if it works, we\u2019ll be in trouble if the main station finds out,\u201d I said, shrugging.\nHe chortled. \u201cSo what if they find out? We\u2019re investigating the origins of this mysterious ecosystem sphere, so we have no choice but to keep evidence. If nothing else works, I can always write up an observational report on fish gill function in a zero-gravity environment and hand it to them. They can\u2019t object to scientific research.\u201d Old Liu tossed the glass sphere to me as I spoke.\nI caught the sphere and looked at it for a while, at the carp, as pure and glittering as something made of crystal. It felt like I was anticipating the arrival of a new friend. That persuaded me. I set the mystery of this ecosystem sphere\u2019s appearance aside, as my mind already began to consider what name to give this space fish.\nThe folks in Tiangong main station were all out of ideas regarding the appearance of the ecosystem sphere in near-Earth orbit, so they didn\u2019t stop us from keeping the fish. Meanwhile, our new pal soon proved Old Liu right. In a day\u2019s time, with the melting of the ice, he\u2019d revived from his frozen condition. He hadn\u2019t fully adjusted to the zero gravity, and he looked a little frail, but his life was definitely in no danger. Raising fish in space was already a fairly mature experimental technology; that night, Old Liu designed a custom system, adding a loop to both the water and air circulation systems and running them through a small glove box, allowing for automatic water replacement and manual oxygenation. All we had to do was toss in feed, and the fish would thrive.\nThree hours later, the little guy had fully adjusted to the zero-gravity environment of outer space, nimbly tumbling and turning in six degrees of freedom. He\u2019d sometimes even blow out a string of big bubbles, surrounding himself with them, then pop them one by one with slaps of his tail, having a blast all on his own. Based on that behavior, I wanted to name him Bubbles, but Old Liu refused, insisting on calling him \u201cSecond Master.\u201d It was a reference to the Peach Garden Brothers from Romance of the Three Kingdoms\u2014he was Old Liu, as in Liu Bei, the fish was Second Master Guan, as in Guan Yu, and I was Lil\u2019 Zhang, as in Zhang Fei\u2014three brothers in outer space who had only one another to depend on. The fish\u2019s status in the space station had really shot up with our getting acquainted, clearly overtaking that of a mostly idle grapple operator like me. Caving to Old Liu\u2019s tyranny, I had no choice but to respectfully address him as \u201cSecond Master.\u201d\nAt first, Second Master gave us a lot of scares. The first time we saw him turn over belly-up and stop moving, we thought he was sick. But when we got closer, Second Master started happily swimming around again. It made sense, after some thought. There was no up, down, left, or right in outer space. In the water, Second Master chose a direction to face purely at random. Every day, when we assumed our positions, Second Master was in a new orientation. The odds of him taking a \u201cnormal\u201d orientation were actually pretty small.\nYou lose track of time in a space station. Amid the daily routine of dry tasks, Second Master became our closest pal. Fish couldn\u2019t speak; sometimes, this made him an even better listener for pouring your heart out to. He had no choice but to be there for you in his primitive way, to receive you, to accept what you entrusted to him.\nDuring this time, Second Master\u2019s origin continued to puzzle us. Old Liu made a thorough search of Earth\u2019s microsatellite databases and research programs, but failed to turn up any records of five-kilogram frozen ecosystem spheres being launched into outer space. Even after analyzing the ecosystem sphere\u2019s structure and construction, we couldn\u2019t make heads nor tails out of its launcher\u2019s motives. Without further leads, we even started to wonder if some supernatural hand lay behind the riddle of Second Master\u2019s origin.\nBut our lack of clues didn\u2019t last for too long. Soon, news came from the Tiangong main station. Our orbit was once again going to take us by that parade of CubeSats, and this time, the window of opportunity would be long enough for me to grab two of them.\nI took a seat at the console. To relieve my anxiety, I asked Old Liu, same as last time, what he thought we\u2019d haul back this time around.\n\u201cAt most, we\u2019ll end up with another Second Master,\u201d Old Liu guessed unimaginatively.\nSince the last time we\u2019d seen these satellites, their formation had grown slightly more scattered and messier, although they were still very close together. Visual observation showed that some of these crude galvanized iron boxes had lost their lids; their small, scattered components could be a serious threat to our space station. For safety, I chose to take the same strategy as my first retrieval attempt, starting with the front-most satellite to minimize disturbance to the formation.\nThe first retrieval proceeded without a hitch, but something went wrong while I was reeling the second satellite back in. The hold suddenly shook violently.\nI cursed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I yelled behind me.\n\u201cA micrometeoroid hit the water tank. Don\u2019t worry, auto-repair activated,\u201d Old Liu answered heavily.\nI took a deep breath and continued to operate the grapple, carefully towing the satellite into the airtight hold. Despite the shock, the retrieval process went through without any harm done.\nThe two sheet metal boxes looked identical to the one from before. They were just as crudely constructed, with several screws missing without a trace\u2014the earlier hit to the space station had probably come from one of those screws. Thankfully, there hadn\u2019t been a huge difference in relative velocity, and our space station had taken precautions in a region with relatively high levels of space junk, or the consequences would have been unimaginable.\nOld Liu picked up one of the boxes, flipped it over, and discovered that the bottom face had a round hole in it. He deftly removed the sole remaining screw in the lid, lifted it, and, seeing the \u201cpayload\u201d that drifted out, once more descended into a state of shock.\nThis metal box held a huge, extraordinary . . . flashlight.\nThe flashlight thoroughly exceeded the dimensions of your average household flashlight. It was at least three times the diameter, and more than twice the length. Fortunately, it hadn\u2019t been turned on, or the effect in the hold would be nothing short of a small flash grenade exploding.\n\u201cHey, Old Liu?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the cheapest rates on a commercial rocket launch?\u201d\n\u201cFor a heavy launch, seven or eight thousand yuan per kilo. For a small launch, forty or fifty thousand per kilo?\u201d\n\u201cThen . . . what kind of crazy rich person would spend that much money to send this random crap into space?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t stress about it, the world of rich people is beyond your comprehension.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, that made me feel zero percent better.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Old Liu turned and picked up the other metal box. \u201cWhat do you think is in this one?\u201d he asked. \u201cLast time, we picked up a fish Second Master Guan. Maybe this time, we\u2019ve picked up a real Second Master Guan!\u201d he said, giving it a rap.\nWe\u2019d thought that after two astonishing unboxings, nothing could surprise us anymore. But reality had a knack for finding ways to rock our puny minds.\nWhen we lifted aside the galvanized metal lid, the first thing to emerge was a gold-colored cap, followed by a face. It was a familiar face, a face the color of jujubes, with brows like silkworms, narrow phoenix eyes, and a long, flowing beard. Following it came the body, holding an ingot of gold, drifting slowly out. Only then could we ascertain that this time, the payload wasn\u2019t \u201cSecond Master,\u201d but a real, actual icon of Second Master Guan, drifting in orbit two thousand six hundred kilometers from Earth until we managed to pick it up.\n\u201cOld Liu . . . this wouldn\u2019t happen to be something you chucked out there just to mess with me, would it?\u201d I said slowly, staring at the statuette as it rotated lazily in midair.\n\u201cWhy would you think that, at a time like this . . . \u201d He\u2019d frozen for a moment before turning to look at me. He\u2019d clearly received a considerable shock too.\nOnce again, I descended into thought. Who would go to that much effort to deliver an ecosystem ball, a flashlight, and a statue of Second Master Guan into orbit? Was this some kind of art project? Or some kind of ritual?\n\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it too much, drink some water to cool down.\u201d Old Liu patted me, kicked off the wall, drifted over to the drinking water dispenser, and poured me a cup. Maybe I\u2019d sunk too deep into overthinking; even the water seemed to taste strange today, faintly acidic and displeasing.\nAs I sipped water and pondered, Old Liu suddenly gave a shout, interrupting my train of thought.\n\u201cStop woolgathering, something\u2019s wrong with Second Master!\u201d He urgently pulled me over to the water tank. To be honest, Second Master didn\u2019t seem any different than usual, idle in the water, gently waving his gills. But normally, once we got near, he\u2019d start swimming merrily around. Today, he didn\u2019t react at all.\n\u201cIs he sick?\u201d Old Liu asked. When it came to Second Master, even he couldn\u2019t completely keep his cool.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, fish are hardy animals. Was he like this earlier?\u201d I felt a pang too, and had to toss the matter of the weird taste in my mouth out of mind.\n\u201cNo, he was darting around just fine ten minutes ago. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d suddenly stop moving.\u201d Old Liu had calmed down and was beginning to analyze the situation in front of us. \u201cIs it hypoxia?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. If it\u2019s lack of oxygen, we\u2019d be feeling tired too. Maybe there\u2019s a problem with your water aerator.\u201d\nOld Liu immediately twisted the valve on the aerator. Bursts of oxygen-rich water pumped in through the pressurization unit. The system looked just fine.\nSo the aerator wasn\u2019t the problem. I sat cross-legged in midair, considering other possibilities. The weird taste from the water earlier still lingered in my mouth. That strange salty taste in particular was making it hard to focus. All I wanted was to rinse my mouth out.\nBut even before I went to get water, I suddenly felt like I\u2019d woken from a dream. The most disastrous possibility of all appeared in my mind. I hurriedly told Old Liu, \u201cIt\u2019s the water. There might be a problem with the water circulation system.\u201d\nOld Liu tensed all over. \u201cInstead of hypoxia, what if it\u2019s nitrate poisoning? I\u2019ll go check.\u201d He suddenly gave me a long look, then silently departed. Five minutes later, the tank\u2019s water replacement system came to life. Ten minutes later, Bubbles flicked his tail, beginning to move again.\nNot long after that, Old Liu came back with an awkward expression. He looked at me without speaking.\n\u201cGo ahead, I\u2019m mentally prepared for whatever you have to say,\u201d I said heavily.\n\u201cOkay. Possibly because of the overly high calcium content in the fish feed, the purification process in our water circulation system has been under additional strain this whole time. As of last night, the system had reached its limit\u2014only to receive an additional shock from the space junk that hit the water tank earlier, which caused the system to completely overload. Due to all the calcium-based precipitate clogging up the filtration system and lowering its efficiency, the amines from the urine weren\u2019t fully purified away and absorbed . . . they flowed into the water tank, resulting in nitrate poisoning.\u201d Old Liu described the cause of this malfunction with professionalism and scientific language.\n\u201cGreat. So, I have another question.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cThis is water from the circulation system?\u201d\n\u201c . . . Yes.\u201d\n\u201cWater shouldn\u2019t have a salty taste, right? Can you tell me where this salty taste came from, then? Do you need a drink to cool down too?\u201d I waved the leftover water from earlier in front of him.\nAt this point, all the water in the tank had been replaced, and Second Master was waving his gills, as if he had woken up. Faced with my soul-piercing question, Old Liu could only laugh painedly, turn away, and start poking at Second Master.\n\u201cHah,\u201d I said coldly. \u201cSecond Master really is your lucky carp. I\u2019ll spare you this time.\u201d I threw the water pouch aside and prepared to rinse my mouth.\n\u201cWait!\u201d Old Liu suddenly called out, stopping me. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\n\u201cI said I\u2019d spare you. What, you want to drink it after all?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the thing about Second Master.\u201d\n\u201cSecond Master is your lucky carp. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, not understanding.\n\u201cI think, I\u2019ve figured out the riddle of Second Master\u2019s origin.\u201d Old Liu pondered for a while, then suddenly seemed to have realized something. He grabbed the tablet and started looking something up. After a while, an advertisement that could only display on the dark web appeared in front of me, resolving all our confusion. Below is an excerpt from the ad copy\u2014the name of the company is redacted to avoid suspicion of sponsorship:\nStill stressing over your horoscope? Anxious about your astrological outlook?

Fortunately, we never tried to grab one particular satellite\u2014it exploded before the fourth crossing of our orbits. It wasn\u2019t a bomb, just a harmless red flash-bang, but it shone for a full day and night in its orbit. Apparently that one was called \u201cStar of Bethlehem,\u201d for wealthy people who wanted their kid to grow up a prophet.\nBut at least, the problem was resolved, and all three members of our space station remained alive and well. Unlike the ending of \u201cFeathered Friend,\u201d we didn\u2019t report the whole thing to the higher-ups, just the origin of the weird satellites. That\u2019s why, next time you go vacationing in space, you won\u2019t see a \u201cfishy friend\u201d in every space station.

Her face looks wounded then healed, welcoming some other color of light.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re already here.\u201d I look silly holding the cigarette, but I\u2019m holding it anyway.\nWe stand in the shadow of a Ferris wheel. Pepe\u2019s white silk skirt billows in the wind. Her long, slender legs never seem to touch the ground. I have to keep hold of her. This makes me look stupid, so it makes me angry.\nEven more annoying, when she hits me with her lollipop, I can\u2019t hit back.\n\u201cHey, idiot, let\u2019s go to the amusement park.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re already here.\u201d\nHer eyes grow wide. She grabs my cigarette, takes a deep drag, then realizes I\u2019ve only been pretending.\n\u201cPepe.\u201d I want her to look at me, but her scarlet lips pout then she blows a smoke ring at the sky. The way she looks at the sky always make me nervous. Our creator put a tightly wound spring into our bodies. But, in the end, even he forgot where each spring\u2019s key went to. By the time he died, rust covered our springs like lichen on his tombstone. Because we\u2019ll never have tombstones, our creator gave us springs.\nHe was fair. I tell myself that a lot. I know that was me telling a lie, but who cares. I only lie when I\u2019m telling stories and, whenever I speak, I can only tell stories.\nWe were created to tell stories. On a good day, a person can tell so many, many stories. They ought to have some principles in them\u2014storytelling principles. But we don\u2019t know any. We\u2019re driven by tightly wound springs. Once they start turning, stories spin out of our bodies. We scatter them like seeds wherever we run to. When we tell stories, our lips wriggle as fast as flight. The people listening to us get dizzy. It\u2019s better when they close their eyes as they listen. When they close their eyes, they can understand better the stories we tell. However, they can never fully understand.\nThis is how our creator first designed us. People called him a drunk. One day, after he poured his thirteenth shot of tequila (he\u2019d downed only twelve shots at most before), suddenly, he smacked his head then rushed home. Black and white blocks of ideas collided in a great dark and bright river inside his body. Pain shook his hands, twisted his back, and made him howl. That night, our creator downed his thirteenth shot of tequila, he went home, then he created us.\nHe said we were salt. The salt of his palm. The salt of the earth.\nWhen he finished speaking, he drove us all away.\nThe scene was so chaotic. So small a house. So many people. Everyone craned their necks. So crowded. Bodies squeezed against bodies. All of them alike.\nThe hot air was insufferable. My skin hurt. My nose hurt. The pain in my throat rushed down into my heart. We exhaled the burning air then inhaled again. Everyone hurt but no one left. We were waiting for our creator to speak again but he didn\u2019t. He rose, brandishing his fist to drive us all out of the house. Everyone ran, pushing and squeezing their way to the door, the extremely narrow door. Random shadows and screams rose from inside the room. Rocking and swaying, we collided onto the street.\nThe outside was so cool. The wind poured into my head through my ears. It blew away the screams but our shadows continued to scramble up the walls. My head opened like a gate and let the wind scream into an empty darkness just like the room I\u2019d just left was now.\nWithout a thought, I ran and ran and ran.\nBefore I realized what had happened, it had happened. Pepe\u2019s hand was in mine. Her hair and skirt fluttered backward in the wind like outstretched wings. We ran hand in hand into the darkness.\nThis is exactly how it happened.\nI was wearing khaki shorts. Pepe was wearing her white skirt. We ran hand in hand into the darkness.\nWe are story-telling machine kids. We\u2019ll never grow up. Forever wearing khaki shorts. Forever wearing a white skirt. Forever, except for telling stories, unable to speak.\nThe crowd waiting to ride the pirate ship parts in two. The people in front scatter to make room for us. Adults, children, even infants all look at us with friendly expressions. I\u2019ve told them Pepe is my kid sister, that she has a serious illness and that she doesn\u2019t have many days left to live. Pepe is thrilled because she doesn\u2019t need to wait in line to ride the pirate ship. She runs, dragging me to the front. I hear some people sigh. Pepe definitely doesn\u2019t look normal. This make them believe my story even more. In the story I told these kind-hearted people, she\u2019ll die soon. So no matter what she does, it will be forgiven. So long as she doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cBefore this world could yet have been considered a world, thirteen witches passed through here. As a result, they chose here to settle down. As a result, they became this world\u2019s first witches. They predate this world.\u201d\nI cover Pepe\u2019s mouth and drag her away from the woman taking tickets. Pepe\u2019s white skirt rustles as it grazes the woman\u2019s red skirt. The ticket woman is still thinking about what Pepe said. When people speak, it must be for some practical reason. She can\u2019t understand what Pepe\u2019s words mean.\n\u201cYour tickets?\u201d Her gaze lingers on me.\nI hand over the tickets. At the same time, I compliment her eyes. \u201cOnce, I met a girl. Her eyes were extremely beautiful. Just like you.\u201d\nShe smiles a little. She can understand my words. Or so she thinks.\nPepe and I sit at the prow of the pirate ship. Soon, the entire ship has filled up. People next to Pepe and me looked at our legs, which shake up and down as though we had leg cramps. They treat us like misbehaving children. If they knew who we were, they\u2019d call the police to arrest us, or wait until the pirate ship swung into mid-air then toss us out.\nHowever, that era has long passed. That\u2019s what their grandparents had done. Back then, they weren\u2019t that old yet and they were stronger than us. Their bloodshot eyes, flaring nostrils, angry slogans and the loss of life. The fanaticism that fermented during day, the fanaticism that fermented during the deep purple night. I remember all those things.\nThose people were all drunk. In throngs, they searched every corner. They wanted to expose us, separate us from the other children wearing full, white skirts and khaki shorts. It always goes like this: They chase us, they block us, they surround us, they ask us questions. All the kids who can\u2019t answer are grabbed by the ankle, lifted into the air, then shaken like empty pockets back and forth against walls, against utility poles, against the ground, against railings. Our bodies are so light. That\u2019s how our creator designed us. Even if they smash us to pieces, we won\u2019t leak tears.\nWe also don\u2019t have blood.\nPeople walked over the tumbling bits of us that now covered the ground. They never wanted to know that originally we had hearts too. They just wanted us to die. We shouldn\u2019t have been discovered. This world doesn\u2019t need any stories because stories are wrong. They are dangerous and despicable. Desires meet and shine a light on the secrets of the heart. After the first time someone discovered his secret in a story, after that secret spread, people gradually fell out of love with listening to our nonsense. In it, they heard their own past, what they didn\u2019t want other people to know. They shut our mouths. It\u2019s always like that. This was just one battle.\nThey wanted to kill us then throw us away. So, they first let themselves think we were harmful beings to be feared. If they didn\u2019t prevent it, one day in the future, we\u2019d become so powerful and destructive, nothing could compare to us. After they convinced themselves, they started to tell others. At last, the most eloquent of them was selected to be their leader. When they assembled, he stood on a great, big platform and roared into the microphone. The dark, dense and turbulent crowd below, like the sea echoing the wind, roared in response.\nAt last, they waged war. They won.\nMany years later, the people who waged and fought the war were placed into Intensive Care Units, slow catheters inserted into their bodies. They were old now, settled down, near to death. The deathly pale hospital light shrouded their dull, ashen skin like a layer of dirty snow on the road. They\u2019d finally calmed down. And I still have Pepe, sitting next to the children of their children riding the pirate ship together.\nThe pirate ship starts to move. Pepe squirms, tugging at my sleeve. She\u2019s afraid of being rocked back and forth. The big machine starts to buzz. The first downswing is just a gentle sway. Pepe looks like she wanted to cry. She won\u2019t stop beating her temples with her fists. I grab her wrists, but the disaster is about to start. Her tongue is moving, continuing the story she just started:\n\u201cThe witches loved to sing. They sang of the earth and there was the earth. They sang of the sky and there was the sky. They kept singing and this world changed into what it is now. At last, one day, the witches didn\u2019t think this was fun any more. They had nothing left to sing about.\n\u201c \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re needed any more,\u2019 the best tempered witch said.\n\u201c \u2018Then let\u2019s change the game we play,\u2019 the smartest witch said.\n\u201c \u2018Are you suggesting subtraction?\u2019 guessed the the witch who understood people the best, cocking her head.\n\u201c \u2018Right. Play a punishment game,\u2019 the most brutal witch yelled, waving her arms.\n\u201cThe rest of the witches agreed, one after another. Just like that, the witches agreed to play the subtraction game.\u201d\nI hug Pepe. No one listens to her story. Light and lively music starts to play. The pirate ship flies into the air. Everyone screams. Now the ship stops at the peak of its swing to the right for a couple seconds or maybe an hour. We\u2019re at the bottom of the ship looking at the people at the top bowing their heads and staring at us. Their mouths stretch into large, black holes, exposing their throats. Only Pepe doesn\u2019t scream. Her soft red lips change shape. She continues to tell her story. No one listens.\nI practically clamp her under my arms. Stay still, Pepe.\nPepe lets me. Her head droops. Just like before, she doesn\u2019t move, not even one bit, her arms wrapped around my waist. I let go a little. Suddenly, the pirate ship falls. It swoops down from its peak on the right and inertia pushes it up to the left. I scream, pushing myself away from Pepe. She throws herself on me, choking me. Her fingernails have grown long again. I always remember to cut her fingernails. Every time, I cut down to down to nothing and, by the time we fight, I\u2019m still scratched by them just the same. Her fingernails grow so fast. Pepe is just that kind of kid. Her hair and fingernails grow and grow like mad. Like the weeds in a wasteland, they never stop. Pepe is just that kind of kid. When she goes crazy, she doesn\u2019t care who she hurts or what she destroys.\nI cave under her attack. She definitely hates me to death, brandishing her arms, wanting to rip me to pieces. My hairband breaks. Black hair scatters, fluttering like snakes in the air. Far away, the sky and earth quiver and sway. The music and shouting mix in the wind. The pirate ship stops. We\u2019re at the very top, nearly parallel to the ground, our whole body weight straining against the seatbelts. You\u2019re okay as long as you hold onto the armrest. However, I have to hold onto Pepe\u2019s wrists. Loosen my grip even a little and she\u2019ll start beating me again. Next time, she might use her teeth. Pepe, stay still, stay still. I face her and gaze into her eyes. That way, she\u2019ll stay still. However, she hides her eyes behind her hair.\n\u201cThe witches want to play the subtraction game,\u201d she says.\nPepe opens her mouth. A moist, warm breath rushes out. She cries. I stared at her, wordlessly. I want to save my strength.\nThe pirate ship drops to the ground. The moment of weightlessness is like leaving our bodies. I begin to laugh.\nOur arms untangle. She immediately curls into a ball.\nPepe must hate me to death. I\u2019ve never told her stories. When she told stories, I never listened. Finally, I didn\u2019t even let her tell stories. She knew why. However, she still has never paid any attention to me.\nSo, she became the way she is now. The stories that sprawled like weeds in her head filled her. Her eyes grew blacker by the day. Later, her fingernails grew black too. Finally, even her lips grew black. I had to take her to the doctor. (Our heads are the same as human\u2019s. Even doctors can\u2019t tell the difference.) The X-ray was completely black. I knew why. It was because of all the untold stories but I couldn\u2019t tell the doctors that. I couldn\u2019t even tell Pepe. The doctors met for a few days and still didn\u2019t know what to do. At last, I suggested plastic surgery, at least to change her lips back. Pepe constantly biting me had given her a chocolate smile.\nThe surgery was a huge success. They gave her strawberry red lips. Everyone was thrilled. Pepe thought she\u2019d been completely cured. That day, she was truly happy, but she still bit my earlobes. Finally, I realized that, by then, Pepe was already wrong in the head. Her eyes seemed just like black pools, almost without whites. Not long after, Pepe became truly crazy.\nHer eyes seem just like black pools, shining with a fuliginous light.\nAs long as I listen to her stories, everything\u2019s fine. This way, she won\u2019t get frenzied. I can also tell her my stories. This way, we\u2019ll both be a little more comfortable. However, I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m fed up. I hate Pepe.\nEven though I can pretend what I do is for her own good, and she\u2019s definitely getting better by the day, even though I can pretend I don\u2019t know I\u2019m hurting her, I know she\u2019s not happy. She\u2019s crazy now. What I\u2019m doing I do on purpose. I hate her and her stories.\nCome on, Pepe. Use your fingernails to rip open my chest. I want to tear off your scalp.\nThings are always like this. We wrestle, claw, and hate each other to death. But neither one of us ever leaves the other.\nMaybe I\u2019m also going crazy. Maybe I\u2019m already crazy.\nI never let Pepe know about going crazy. On the other hand, I still wanted to work hard to pretend we were normal kids. No, we weren\u2019t kids who told stories. No, we didn\u2019t tell stories at all. People believed us. They knew our creator didn\u2019t give us programs for telling intentional lies. Our creator created us only to tell stories. Except for stories, we couldn\u2019t say anything. This was how people recognized us.\nThey asked us questions.\nThey killed those who couldn\u2019t speak.\nThey killed those who told stories.\nThose kids were exactly like us. They were shaken back and forth like empty flour sacks, just like us right now.\nWhen the massacre started, Pepe and I saw them die with our own eyes. We didn\u2019t grieve. We didn\u2019t get angry. After all, death is death. Death is also nothing. Death is slight, just like an empty flour sack.\nI didn\u2019t want to die, not one bit. When they ripped me away from the rest of the kids, I held onto Pepe\u2019s hand and never let go. A lot of people tried to pry our hands apart, but they were wasting their strength. A fool carrying a knife threatened to cut off our hands if we didn\u2019t let go. Pepe and I set our throats free. We began crying. Immediately, all the other kids began crying too. The adults panicked. At last, the adult who started this let us answer their questions together. \u201cEither they both are or they both aren\u2019t. Answering together might save some time.\u201d So they asked their questions.\nI opened my mouth. I made sounds. I spoke. I didn\u2019t tell stories. As a result, we survived.\nThey gave us yellow, five-pointed stars. We stuck them on our chests as we walked into another group of kids. They wore khaki pants or full, white skirts. They all had yellow, five-pointed stars fastened on their chests. The kids who didn\u2019t have yellow, five-pointed stars were on the other side. Among them, so many looked at me, astounded. Their pale faces shone with the blackness of night. They looked at me with amazement, to the point that they forgot that they were about to die.\nThis was not part of our creator\u2019s original plan. We were created following the same steps for the same purpose. Finally, for the same reason, we ought to be killed in the same way. I shouldn\u2019t leave them because we\u2019re the same kind of kids. They knew that but had no way to say it.\nPerhaps they could have told stories, told treasonous and false stories. If the adults were smart, perhaps they could have figured out that I was actually telling a story, one that didn\u2019t believe that it was story. However, the kids didn\u2019t have time. They\u2019d be dead soon. After they died, they\u2019d be like empty flour sacks. They\u2019d be nothing.\nNothing I did could seem out of the ordinary. When they asked me questions, I was certainly telling them stories. I treated everything that happened as a story to tell. You see, survival was just that simple. None of this is the truth. All of this is a story. As long as you think this, you can recount events in the way humans speak because you\u2019re telling a story. This isn\u2019t anything unusual. Those who are like us are unusual. I, myself, am also a little unusual.\nOnly Pepe doesn\u2019t seem unusual. Maybe she knew long ago that I\u2019d act like this. Because she was also not unusual, we could survive. Even though the rest of the kids who told stories were all unusual, they wanted to survive. From among those kids, I saved only Pepe. This was inevitable after we\u2019d rushed out of that black room together. I thought, for kids who told stories, Pepe and I had brains that were atypical.\nWe were atypical from the start. This notion stops my hand. A few hits later, Pepe also calms down. Her black eyes gaze at me, her long hair draped over shoulders. The world is no longer in upheaval. The pirate ship has stopped.\nPeople disembark from the pirate ship. A girl with blond hair tied with a pink butterfly bow walks ahead of us. Her skirt is also pink, highly creased and topped with lace. Very pretty, but not as pretty as the graceful arc of her calves. I can\u2019t see her face.\n\u201cThe tortoise and the hare raced. The tortoise was always behind. He wanted to see the hare\u2019s face. That way, he could find out the color of her eyes.\u201d\nThat is Pepe telling her shortest story.\nI laugh. Pepe doesn\u2019t know that the tortoise also longed for the hare\u2019s lips. She\u2019s still too young, so she doesn\u2019t understand desire. But I have desire. I want to know. Kids who tell stories are kids who have no needs. We eat. We sleep. We tell stories, but not from need. But on that day, when I came to treat this world as a story, I suddenly developed desire. At that moment, I understood this world even better. I understood even better the stories we told and spread.\n\u201cLet\u2019s ride the carousel, okay?\u201d I said to Pepe.\nShe lowers her head, staring at her rounded leather shoes. Pink Butterfly Bow has just entered a gold pumpkin carriage.\n\u201cCome.\u201d I drag Pepe, rushing to the ticket taker before the carriage starts to move. Very few people are riding the carousel. I pick a red horse for Pepe, then climb onto the wooden horse closest to the gold pumpkin carriage. The carousel starts to move. Odd music begins to play. We ride up and down among the colored lights. Butterfly Bow is really happy. She smiles, waving her hands at her side. I see her eyes, a charming emerald green. In stories, men call girls whose eyes are this shade of green sirens. The men bring those girls home, fondle them, then let them cry. I start to get excited. The horse under my body chases the carriage ahead of it with all its power.\nButterfly Bow looks as though her heart has opened with joy. She probably feels like she must be a real princess. I hope that she\u2019ll also wave at me and smile and she does. Her smile brushes past us and I feel so lucky. She\u2019s really beautiful. I\u2019ll remember her the way she is right now, forever.\nI love her. I always fall rashly in love with these sorts of girls. When they\u2019re young, I meet them by chance then I fall in love with them. It\u2019s a harmless love. Nothing ever comes of it.\nI can put my love for them into the drawer of my heart. Pepe isn\u2019t there. She\u2019s not like those girls.\nBecause she is my drawer. Pepe knows I\u2019ve never put her into the drawer of my heart. But she doesn\u2019t know she is my drawer. This point is very important, and also very unimportant. In any case, we hate each other to death.\nI hate Pepe, hate her telling her never-ending stories. Even without having her spring wound, those stories\u2014so annoying they should just die\u2014gush nonstop out of her body. Yet, pushing words out of me is gradually getting harder and harder. I\u2019ve no strength left. I haven\u2019t been speaking as much lately. I\u2019ll speak even less until my mouth shuts up, forever.\nOnce, I searched all over without finding a trace of the key. I\u2019ve already become a very person-like thing. I just need the key and I\u2019ll be a person. No key and I will be dead. I\u2019m almost dead now. Pepe is still telling stories nonstop.\nThe carousel keeps spinning round and round. We surround a large post, revolving around it. I\u2019m behind Butterfly Bow, Butterfly Bow is behind Pepe and Pepe is behind me. No, Pepe, you\u2019re in front of me. The carousel keeps spinning round and round. We surround a large post, revolving around it. I can\u2019t see Pepe. However, Pepe, you must be there. Pepe, my Pepe.\nI can just make out someone speaking. It\u2019s Pepe. She\u2019s telling stories again. The sound of her voice is odd, as though it\u2019s being stretched and stretched by something. Drunks croon like this but, Pepe, why are you? This is not good.\nIt\u2019s awkward and dangerous. I must have forgotten something important. As I was telling you the story, I must have left out something really important. I should have realized sooner. Every good storyteller ought to have mastered this sort of narration technique. I should have realized sooner. Because when we escaped from the house, I was the one who held Pepe\u2019s hand tight. Out of so many people, I held her hand tight and have never ever let go.\nI don\u2019t realize this is a problem until we reach the Ferris wheel. Now, it\u2019s too late. You can\u2019t blame me for this. Pepe keeps telling stories. That story about witches wanting to play the subtraction game she\u2019s told over a thousand times, but she\u2019s never finished it even once. She is already mad. She glares at the sky, waiting, waiting, waiting, for the story to continue. Because she doesn\u2019t continue the story herself, she grabs and scratches me like mad. A sharp, fearful sound erupts from her body. What is it, what is it, what is it? Blue-green fish swim across the black pools on her face. That sound still rings, piercing my ears.\nPepe\u2019s an idiot. All she knows is to tell these stories she doesn\u2019t understand over and over again. She doesn\u2019t understand anything, but she wants to speak anyway. That\u2019s simply how our creator designed us. The spring keeps unwinding. Stories are told. But after so many years have passed, no one remembers where, whatever weird place, those keys have been kept. At first, no one worried about this problem. Maybe because we can\u2019t even find our own springs? Besides, that was a problem for years in the future. Many years have now passed, we\u2019ve gone mad and the other kids have died. No one cares about those keys. No one worries about something that won\u2019t matter yet for years. There\u2019s just no story, that\u2019s all.\nIt\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay.\nBright light fills the amusement park. The smell of popcorn lingers in the air. The flavor of sweat, engine oil and sausages stick to the lights bulbs. Lamps light the Ferris wheel, making it seem like a giant pinwheel spinning slowly in the transparent wind. The places where Pepe grabbed me begin to itch. One by one, I scratch each itch. From all the rubbing, my body smells rotten. If not for wounds, kids who tell stories would never rot.\nUnderneath my khaki pants, my legs are filled with scars of wounds unable to heal.\nPepe is looking at me. She sits across from me, so peaceful. When she can\u2019t go on with a story, she turns her face out the window. The sky is purple. The window faintly reflects us sitting together side by side. The Ferris wheel slowly rises. The people below us shrink. Pepe stands from her seat. She tugs a little at her full, white skirt.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to the amusement park,\u201d she says as she leans out of the window, facing distant lights.\nI stared closely at her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a story, Pepe? You can just speak now.\u201d\nPepe\u2019s head turns around. Laughter rushes at me. She hasn\u2019t laughed like this in a long time.\nI hold on to the railing as I fasten the catch. The wind\u2019s blocked out. We\u2019ve ridden in the Ferris wheel compartment to its highest point and soon it\u2019ll slowly descend. On the ground, one by one, a crowd gathers facing something small and white. It\u2019s so small that it\u2019s more like a white speck.\nPepe, why are they talking about you? From up here, I can\u2019t see clearly what you look like now. The Ferris wheel has already reached its highest point. The carriage will stop here for a moment, hanging by itself in mid-air. Then it\u2019ll descend, descend to the earth. I\u2019ll visit your body then leave. In my heart, I play over and over everything that will happen. It\u2019s so chaotic below. They won\u2019t pay any attention to me. I\u2019ll show some sorrow and confusion. This way, they\u2019ll believe you and I have nothing to do with each other then they\u2019ll release me. Maybe they already know you\u2019re a kid who tells stories. They\u2019ll still guess you either jumped or were pushed from the top of the Ferris wheel. So I still have to play innocent for a while.\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this isn\u2019t hard. You know that I can lie. I think of what happens to me as a story. In a loud voice, I\u2019ll recite the story version of me like an actor\u2019s lines. As a result, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m a normal kid. What I\u2019ll say are all things a normal kid says. They can\u2019t see my spring unwind. It unwinds and unwinds, pushing hard against this scary world, turning what happened into a story. In my mind, I tell myself none of this is real. This is a story. A story, so a lie is no longer a lie. I\u2019ve merely changed the way that I tell stories. Yes, Pepe, you knew. That\u2019s why you laughed.\nYou kept laughing because you knew\u2014the story of this amusement park was your final story.\nI think maybe I\u2019m wrong, perhaps I haven\u2019t changed the way I tell stories, rather, I\u2019m just living in a story. No, you\u2019ll never understand these two aren\u2019t the same. We\u2019ll never understand.\nBut this doesn\u2019t matter. You lie on the ground, peaceful, broken, accepting the crowd\u2019s chatter. I\u2019ll pass by your body then innocently leave.\nThat there\u2019s no key isn\u2019t my fault. Soon, I\u2019ll become utterly silent yet alive forever. Killing you also isn\u2019t my fault. I\u2019ll live forever, and be utterly silent.\n\u201cExcuse me, you dropped something.\u201d As I\u2019m leaving the crowd, a woman calls to me. She sneaks me something. It\u2019s ice cold and I almost shake it off my hand. I gaze at it. It\u2019s a smashed up heart-shaped key. Your name is carved on it, Pepe. I know that this must be your heart. I know that this must be my key. I know.\nBut, Pepe, you know, I can no longer find my spring.\nI lost it long ago.\nWe all lost our springs long ago.\nTang Fei is a member of Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.

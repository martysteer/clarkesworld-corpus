A Conversation with Robert V. S. Redick\nRobert V. S. Redick\u2019s The Red Wolf Conspiracy (Del Rey, April 2009) is populated with tarboys, unwilling maidens, mad ship captains, and power hungry sorcerers. Monarchies clash and the lust for power obscures the weighty price of magic. The ocean rages and storm clouds loom. There is conspiracy, treason, and secrecy. Whole empires rest on small choices made by terrified individuals. Set largely aboard the Chathrand, a giant, 600-year old ship, Red Wolf positively reeks of adventure.\nAll in all, Red Wolf tells the story of characters who, according to Redick, are a bunch of misfits.\n\u201cI have a soft spot for misfits, having been one roughly since my diaper years,\u201d Redick wrote in a recent essay at suvudu.com. \u201cOh, not in any tragic, soul-scarring way: my misfit status has always been more a disposition than a curse . . . Misfits suffer (and cause) far more interesting disasters than those who fit snugly into a culture or a camp.\nRedick\u2019s misfits are unforgivably appealing\u2014even his most wretched characters. Each seems to live in the crow\u2019s nest, high above a stormy sea, holding on by fingernails and sheer determination. The jeopardy is constant. The world of Alifros teeters on the edge of collapse\u2014one person at a time.\nRedick\u2019s prose is elegant without being florid, rich without being garish. There is much of the New World/Age of Discovery spice to the tale he tells.\nIn a recent review, Terry Brooks, author of the Shannara novels, praised Red Wolf as \u201ca spirited and exciting journey\u201d and \u201ca throwback to the days of the European adventure story writers--Stevenson, Dumas, Scott and the like\u2014a tale that is a gripping page-turner accessible to all ages.\u201d\nYet, The Red Wolf Conspiracy is also a very humane book--a character driven-novel written from multiple points-of-view. Redick takes on human nature in all its complex glory\u2014from assassins to mermaids, traitors to boy heroes.\nAfter a year of critical acclaim in England, The Red Wolf Conspiracy is finally available in the United States. Redick and I spoke a few days after the novel\u2019s US release on a rare afternoon off from drafting the third book in the Chathrand Voyage series.\nTen years ago, you were a literary writer fascinated with languages and other cultures.\nWho\u2019d have thought it\u2019d come to this, eh? Well, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m still the same guy: still a literary writer obsessed with language and place. You and I have talked before about how the SF and literary worlds fail to engage each other. And since committing to a fantasy novel I\u2019ve thought quite a lot about what personal meaning I attach to the notion of the \u201cliterary.\u201d\nTo me the term indicates a concern with craftsmanship, and with human life as it is intimately experienced: the texture of thought and memory, the interplay of language and consciousness, the self-aware life of the mind\u2014and the interface of these elusive, human phenomena with the larger universe. These happen to be my chief interests; without them I really can\u2019t get too excited about your dragon or your mage.\nBut come on, my fellow literary types, admit it: you\u2019re genre writers too. Westerns have guns and cows; you have neuroses and unreliable narrators.\nYears ago John Updike\u2014who as David Hartwell observes was something of a defender of SF, though he didn\u2019t write it\u2014accused the genre of being so wrapped up in the building of exotic scenarios that it failed to invest in all these \u201chuman subtleties.\u201d We should not lightly dismiss that accusation.\nBut my take on it is a bit different: I\u2019d say that when a work\u2014any work, speculative or mundane\u2014does invest in those subtleties, we collectively push it in the direction of the literary, and see it a bit less as SF/F. Perhaps it began for marketing reasons, but the divide has taken on a life of its own. We are so conditioned to believe in the two spheres that we segregate ourselves.\nHow often have you been to a craft discussion at a SF/F con and heard anyone invoke Conrad, Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Michael Ondaatje, or any other non-SF/F master in a discussion of technique? And how often in an MFA program does one encounter a teacher of literary orientation willing to explore the craft innovations with which SFF abounds?\nThe good news is that I think both camps are getting over their hang-ups, and realizing how much the other side has to offer. It may take another generation, but in time literature in English may indeed let its useless guard down. Latin America managed this back in the 1960s, and the result was the greatest fiction renaissance of the latter half of the twentieth century: the so-called \u201cBoom.\u201d\nWhat do you enjoy most about writing fiction?\nNothing beats those moments of ecstatic discovery, when you first commit material (however rough) to the page. I\u2019ll never forget the joyride of certain first-draft passages: the tiny ixchel fighting to get aboard the Chathrand without being discovered by humans; the fight in the Weather Tower on the emperor\u2019s mountain, the moment Pazel and Neeps are hurled into the depths with orders to plunder a shipwreck or die trying.\nAnd yet your question\u2019s harder than it appears. Those ecstatic moments are the most thrilling, sure, but they can also terrify you and leave you drained. What if it all goes wrong? What if (as R.E.M. has it) \u201call these fantasies come flaming aground?\u201d There\u2019s a scary image for your novel.\nBut the image I return to most often is that of working clay on a potter\u2019s wheel, as I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s sensual, and breathtaking at times: The soft, liquid form of the bowl or vase rises like magic under your hands. But it\u2019s so fragile! As long as that wheel\u2019s in motion there\u2019s a chance the whole structure may list over and collapse.\nDid playing role-playing games (RPGs) as a kid influence what you write about and the way you write it?\nUnquestionably. I was a D&D addict for many years\u2014though I haven\u2019t played it in twenty. It\u2019s juvenile. I mean that with great respect, and would play again in a heartbeat if I could so arrange my life. But again, let\u2019s be honest: a large part of RPGs involves running around, stealing, smashing, crushing and killing things. Not unlike certain sports, except that the actions are literal mental abstractions, rather than symbolic physical ones.\nBut in every other respect role-playing games are an exquisite form of training for storytellers. The most obvious way is world-building, but that in itself means so much more than choosing details and writing them down. There\u2019s dialogue improvisation, scene building, three-dimensional spatial thinking, imaginary timekeeping, dramatic pacing: it\u2019s all there, and you experience it in the most natural and honest way: in a private huddle with your peers. If those peers actually care about the quality of the experience . . .\nIs there a character in the novel (or trilogy) that you most relate to? Or most enjoy writing about?\nWell, one man always springs to mind. I love writing from Captain Rose\u2019s point of view, which in Red Wolf is given through letters he writes to his (possibly deceased) father. Rose is a paranoid, deceptive, violent and wounded megalomaniac. But he brings a twisted zeal to everything he does, and that\u2019s compelling for a writer. There is also a fascination with evil, when it\u2019s done in a complex way. Some might argue that it\u2019s because we have more to learn from those who are not like us than those who are. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case: good has plenty to teach. It may be that we\u2019re engineered to pay sharp attention to those we sense might threaten us.\nBut The Red Wolf Conspiracy employs seven or eight points of view. I think the truth is that I relate most with the POV character I\u2019m writing about at a given moment. Sometimes that identification is more pleasant than others. It\u2019s not pleasant to enter the mind of Sandor Ott, the old spymaster responsible for some of the heinous political trouble my world\u2019s thrown into. It doesn\u2019t feel good to inhabit his internal asylum, his padded cell. But it is my job.\nRed Wolf seems to be about what happens when differences collide. Is that collision at the heart of the book?\nThe collision of differences is near the heart of Red Wolf\u2014but it\u2019s more than that, I\u2019d say. The old buzzword, the old cultural goal, used to be tolerance. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with tolerance per se. It is, however, far from the best we can aspire to. Tolerance is rather flimsy: I\u2019ll tolerate you this far, but don\u2019t get out of line.\nIn the case of Pazel and Thasha and Felthrup and Dri, tolerance certainly won\u2019t keep them alive, or help them defeat Arunis or Sandor Ott. This book is about not just learning to tolerate and comprehend difference, but sometimes to choose it over the familiar. In other words, this is a book about questioning the community you\u2019re born into, and in some cases choosing, building, a new one that reflects the person you\u2019re trying to become.\nHow has your understanding of the craft changed since you finished Red Wolf?\nMy understanding of the challenge of telling a story of this scale has changed in the course of doing so. There are dozens of characters, personal histories, national histories, religious and world-view differences across those nations, simultaneous plotlines: and all of these have to be conveyed with immediacy, drama and simplicity.\nI try to maintain a beginner\u2019s attitude towards learning and relearning the fundamentals of good writing. There are weaknesses I\u2019m probably more aware of than any critic. Use of the narrative zoom lens is one: when to be close-in, deeply embedded in a scene, when to pull back and allow the pace to quicken, and how to slide with grace between these extremes.\nHow do you create tension in a world of magic?\nIn a word, restraint. In my world of Alifros, for example, the use of magic always exacts a heavy price. The animals who wake to human intelligence often go mad. Pazel Pathkendle can learn any language on the face of the earth, but he pays for it with terrifying seizures that make those around him fear that he\u2019s possessed. His mother embraces the study of magic and ends up a distracted wreck who poisons children. And without giving too much away, the greater the power bestowed, the higher the price.\nLast January at Vericon (Harvard), Kim Stanley Robinson explained his dislike for most fantasy. As he put it, in a world where anything is possible, nothing is interesting. And I agree. I\u2019ve never been able to enjoy a fantasy novel where anything is possible. Indeed part of the joy of the reading is often the discovery of what is possible and what is not. Without a doubt, you have to keep a tight rein on your miracles.\nAnd this brings us back to role-playing: another lesson I learned early was just how dull it was to play the part of a demigod, or other figure of unlimited power. I tired of that in an afternoon. Then I joined a campaign where magic was scarce; it had to be sought out and won at great price, and so did every reward of the game. And that kept me coming back for more.\nIf you removed the magic from Red Wolf, would there be a world, a story?\nMagic is a fact of the world of Alifros. If it did not exist, Alifros would not exist as I have built it. Consequently the story too would not exist. Another world and another story with many of the same elements could. But their resemblance would be limited at best.\nI hasten to add that magic is not all that counts. The politics, global and personal, matter a great deal too. Indeed questions of the human heart always seem to trump the efforts of the mighty to shape the world through force alone. Few are the successful writers who do otherwise. Asimov was as technically-oriented a writer as you\u2019ll ever find, but what do his novels hinge on? A robot decides to show mercy. A woman finds the courage to stand up to a tyrant. Small, private choices with outcomes that shake the world.\nJeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

Heinlein won four Hugo awards in his lifetime for Best Novel. Not counting retroactive awards, his last win was in 1967. If you squint you will see another result: Lois McMaster Bujold, four wins for Best Novel with overall sixteen Hugo nominations and seven wins. You have to pay attention to find Connie Willis, despite the fact that the correct answer to the question is actually \u201cConnie Willis\u201d: eleven Hugo Award wins and twenty-four fiction nominations.\nConnie Willis was born in Denver, CO. She earned a BA in English and elementary education from the University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, in 1967, and taught elementary and junior high school from 1967\u20131981. Her first SF story was published by Worlds of Fantasy in 1971, \u201cThe Secret of Santa Titicaca.\u201d She landed her first Hugo nomination for \u201cDaisy, in the Sun,\u201d published in 1979 in Galileo. In 1982 she received a National Endowment for the Arts grant, which made writing full-time possible.\nThat year, she published her first award winners: Hugo- and Nebula-winning novelette \u201cFire Watch\u201d in Isaac Asimov\u2019s Wonders of the World and Nebula-winning story \u201cA Letter from the Clearys\u201d in the July 1982 Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine. First solo novel Lincoln\u2019s Dreams, published by Bantam Spectra in 1987, won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and her second solo novel, Doomsday Book, published by Bantam Spectra in 1992, won Hugo, Nebula, and Locus awards.\nIn fact, Connie Willis also has the most Nebula wins (seven wins and eight nominations) and was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2009. She has won or been nominated for pretty much every major SF award, a slew of minor awards, foreign awards, and even a number of awards you\u2019ve never heard of, not to mention (take note, Google) a 2011 Robert A. Heinlein Award for \u201coutstanding published works in science fiction and technical writings to inspire the human exploration of space.\u201d\nIn 2011 she took home a Nebula for \u201cnovel in two parts\u201d Blackout/All Clear (published by Bantam Spectra), and the next year the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America named Connie Willis the recipient of the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award for her lifetime contributions and achievements in the field. She kept going with a Locus Award win in 2014 for collection The Best of Connie Willis: Award-Winning Stories, Asimov\u2019s Readers\u2019 Poll wins for short story \u201cAll About Emily\u201d in 2012 and for novella \u201cI Met a Traveller in an Antique Land\u201d in 2018, plus a handful of other nods and nominations.\nConnie Willis has lived in Colorado most of her life. She lives (and continues to write notable work) in Greeley, CO with her husband Courtney. In November 2020 novella Take A Look at the Five and Ten was published by Subterranean Press and appeared in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction magazine.\nYou made your first SF sale to Worlds of Fantasy with \u201cThe Secret of Santa Titicaca\u201d in 1971, and earned your first Hugo nomination for \u201cDaisy, in the Sun\u201d in 1979. When did you start to really feel established in the industry, what did it take, and what was the road like getting there?\nLike so many authors, I was one of those \u201covernight successes\u201d that really wasn\u2019t. I started writing stories and sending them out to publishers as soon as I graduated from college and got married (1967). I sold a short story (not SF) and an article on teaching in 1968, and then \u201cSanta Titicaca\u201d in 1971 to a magazine that promptly went belly-up, but basically I worked in isolation for nine long years \u2019til I finally found the Southern Colorado Writers\u2019 Workshop in 1976. The worst moment in all that time was one day when I walked to the post office to pick up the mail. (We lived in a small mountain town without house-to-house mail delivery.) I had a pink slip in our mailbox, and I thought it was a present from my grandmother. Nope. It was every manuscript I had out, coming back with a rejection slip. Until then when I\u2019d gotten a manuscript back, I could always say, \u201cOh, well. But I bet the story I\u2019ve got out to Asimov\u2019s (or F&SF or Omni) will sell,\u201d but this time it was virtually everything, and I took it as a definite sign that God was telling me, \u201cTime to pack it in.\u201d Luckily, I still had a bunch of prestamped manila envelopes at home, so I sent everything out one more time, something sold, and I kept going.\nAs to when I felt fully established, the answer is never. When you\u2019re as neurotic as I am, you\u2019re always worried. As Robert Silverberg (another neurotic) said when we were discussing this, \u201cThere\u2019s always something to worry about. With luck, you can go straight from, \u2018Why can\u2019t I sell anything?\u2019 to all washed-up without anything in between.\u201d\nYour first novel out was Water Witch in 1982, a collaboration with Cynthia Felice; your first solo novel was Lincoln\u2019s Dreams in 1987. Did writing novels change anything about the way you wrote or approached short fiction?\nI remember people saying to me, \u201cYou should try novels. They\u2019re so much easier. They\u2019ve got so much more space.\u201d Nope. If you do it right, you don\u2019t have any space in novels either. Novels are definitely different\u2014you\u2019ve got to have lots more supporting characters and subplots and complications and reversals and twists and turns\u2014but if they\u2019re done right, they\u2019re just as taut and carefully written as short stories. I love writing both for different reasons.\nAre there books or stories that were particularly difficult to write for one reason or another, and how did you overcome the challenges you faced?\nThey\u2019re all difficult. As Erma Bombeck said about housework, \u201cIf you do it right, will kill you.\u201d Early on, I thought, someday soon I\u2019ll figure this out and then writing will be a breeze, but that\u2019s never happened. Every story and novel has a whole different set of things you need to learn how to do. It\u2019s like you\u2019re starting from scratch every time.\nThat\u2019s not quite true. As you continue to write, you learn how to do a bunch of things\u2014dialogue, flashbacks, transitions, description\u2014which you can use on the new story, but writing is still a pain. As somebody or other said, \u201cWriting is easy. You just sit down in front of a blank page and stare at it until drops of blood appear on your forehead.\u201d When I\u2019m on panels with writers who say, \u201cOh, I just love writing. I just sit down and it flows out like magic,\u201d I always want to slap them.\nI only remember one story that came easily, and that was only after I\u2019d struggled for weeks and weeks to come up with an idea. I was supposed to be writing a story about quantum theory for a collection, and nothing, NOTHING, was working. I finally walked down to the library (a mile or so) to try to get an idea, spent a totally unproductive couple of hours there, and then, on the walk home, had a revelation. Once I had the idea, I was able to write the story very easily, based on my recent experiences at the Nebula Awards in Hollywood at a hotel opposite Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre and just down the street from the Frederick\u2019s of Hollywood Bra Museum. The story was \u201cAt the Rialto.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the only time that\u2019s ever happened, and you can\u2019t count on revelations or dreams or the cavalry riding in at the last minute. You just have to keep slogging away. Which, with the exception of that one story, is what I do.\nYou\u2019ve been an award-winning icon in the industry and you have a ton of work out. Did you ever hit a career or a writing slump, where you struggled to sell or produce work? And how did you deal with it?\nDespite appearances, I am an incredibly slow writer. I\u2019ve just produced a lot of stuff because I\u2019m really old. I\u2019ve always been able to keep working, I think because of the way I work, which is in pieces. If I get stuck on one story, I work on another. If I get stuck on one part of a novel, I write some other scene or the ending or something and then come back to the place I was stuck in a couple of weeks. Or I work on something else altogether.\nMy main problems have been A) deadlines, which I hate and obsess over, and when you\u2019re muttering, \u201cOh my god, oh my god, oh my god,\u201d over and over in your head, it\u2019s not really helpful. People tell me to just ignore the deadlines, but I can\u2019t. I keep switching back to high school mode when I absolutely had to get papers in on time and, yes, I obsessed back then, too, and B) all the things that interfere with my writing, like having to feed the cat and call the vet because the dog threw up and deal with e-mails and phone calls and the dishes and the ironing and packing to go to conventions and writing speeches and . . . If only real life wouldn\u2019t intervene, I could get SO much writing done.\nOn the other hand, if I didn\u2019t have all those things to deal with, I wouldn\u2019t have anything to write about, so . . .\nOne of the many things people love about your work is the dialogue. What are the keys to writing effective dialogue?\nI was basically born talking, so dialogue has always come easily to me. (Note: it\u2019s the only thing that has. Everything else\u2014plotting, characterization, description, foreshadowing\u2014I had to learn.)\nTake a Look at the Five and Ten is a holiday tale. I feel like you are drawn to holiday tales, you even have a collection of them. What do you like most about writing them?\nI love Christmas, which is reason enough, I guess, but I also think that good Christmas stories are hard to write\u2014getting just that right mix of cheerful and ironic so the story\u2019s not too schmaltzy, but you also don\u2019t want to kill yourself after reading it.\nI was just asked to help edit and to write the introduction for the Library of America\u2019s collection of American short stories. It was fun, but really challenging\u2014there are SO many stories to choose from, and we were trying to get just the right mix of funny and serious, mainstream and genre, old favorites and things people have never read before, and stories from lots of different backgrounds and cultures, just like the American Christmas itself. I just finished the introduction, and I\u2019m really looking forward to the book\u2019s coming out.\nTake a Look at the Five and Ten is told from Ori\u2019s point of view, a young woman caught up in various kinds of family friction. She\u2019s the target of Sloane\u2019s ire, who jealously guards her latest \u201cboyfriend of the month\u201d and Ori gets ensnared in said boyfriend\u2019s scientific investigations. Or . . . so it seems! What do you like most about Ori? Do you see a lot of yourself in her?\nOri\u2019s obviously a Cinderella character, and as Kurt Vonnegut said, everybody loves that story. It appeals to the downtrodden in all of us. I\u2019m certainly not downtrodden anymore, though I still seem to run into people who make mean-girl remarks, like the kind Sloane and her awful mother are so good at and which invariably wound, as they are intended to. What IS it with mean girls? They must spend hours and hours thinking up the absolute cruelest thing they could possibly say. Where do they find the time? And WHY do they feel the need to say those things? I would love to write a story about the whole mean girl thing, only, even though I have been known on occasion to have a sharp tongue, I could never think of the hurtful comments they come up with.\nWhat is special or important to you about Take a Look at the Five and Ten?\nI worked at the downtown Denver Woolworth\u2019s one Christmas when I was in college and absolutely loved it. As a result, I\u2019ve been talking about it ever since, driving my family and friends crazy (it\u2019s a really boring story) so I decided to see if I could get it out of my system by writing a story about it. With maybe a few embellishments . . .\nWhat is your writing routine like, and has it changed with the pandemic?\nI used to work at Starbucks every day, and the pandemic practically killed me, but I compromised by setting up a work table in the living room and getting my chai at the drive-through. A couple of weeks ago my Starbucks shut down due to COVID and I had to drive halfway across town to get my chai. Addiction is a terrible thing.\nI try to write mornings and then do everything else in the afternoons. And I usually split my writing time into blocks: half an hour on research for the time-travel novel, then an hour on the novel and an hour on something else. If things start going well, then I just keep going, but if not, then the switching out helps me to be productive.\nWhat else are you working on, or what else do you have coming up that readers can look forward to?\nI just finished my alien abduction novel, The Road to Roswell, and it\u2019s been handed over to my agent. It\u2019s about a well-meaning maid of honor, whose crazy friend is getting married at the UFO Museum in Roswell during the UFO Festival, who gets snatched by an alien and forced to drive all over the Southwest while he?she?it? (it looks like a tumbleweed, but with the bullwhip talents of Indiana Jones) abducts other people and tries to communicate what it\u2019s doing there and where it needs her to take him\u2014Area 51? Monument Valley? A Las Vegas wedding chapel?\nI\u2019ve also started work on a new Oxford-historian time-travel novel called The Spanner in the Works, in which a young woman from 1980 accidentally gets transported to the future Oxford (something that\u2019s supposed to be impossible according to time-travel theory.) The time-travel techs are freaked out and try to send her back before she causes any paradoxes, but the drop won\u2019t cooperate and sends her everywhere but back home. Although my time-traveling historians are based in Oxford, I\u2019ve never actually written about the city, which is the home of most of my favorite authors\u2014the Inklings, Dorothy L. Sayers, Lewis Carroll, and Percy Bysshe Shelley (who\u2019s stuck in a basement somewhere and probably deserves to be)\u2014so I decided to write a novel where I could explore Oxford\u2014and Tintern Abbey\u2014in assorted time periods, and Hollywood in the 1930s.\nOh, and I\u2019m working on a story involving paper dolls and another one about Orpheus.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

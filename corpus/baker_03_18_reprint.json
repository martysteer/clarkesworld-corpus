The little community on the roof went right on with its busy social life, preening, squabbling over fish heads, defecating, spreading stubby wings in the morning sunlight, entirely unaware of Smith\u2019s hostile scrutiny.\nAs he continued backward, Smith walked into the low fence around the vegetable patch. He staggered, tottered, and lurched backward, landing with a crash among the demon-melon frames. Instantly, a dozen tiny reptilian heads turned; a dozen tiny reptilian necks craned over the roof\u2019s edge. The dragons regarded Smith with bright fascinated eyes. Smith growled at them helplessly as he flailed there, and they went into tiny reptilian gales of piping laughter.\nDisgusted, Smith got to his feet and dusted himself off. Mrs. Smith, who had been having a quiet smoke by the back door, peered at him.\n\u201cDid you hurt yourself, Smith?\u201d\n\u201cWe have to do something about those,\u201d said Smith, jerking a thumb at the dragons. \u201cThey\u2019re getting to be a nuisance.\u201d\n\u201cAnd possibly a liability,\u201d said Mrs. Smith. \u201cLady What\u2019s-her-name, the one with that pink palace above Cable Steps, had dinner on the terrace last night with a party of friends. I\u2019d just sent Mr. Crucible out with the Pike Terrine when one of these little devils on the roof flies down, bold as you please, and lights on the lady\u2019s plate. She screamed and then for a moment everyone was amused, you know, and one or two of them even said the horrible little creature was cute. Then it jumped up on her shoulder and started worrying at her earring.\n\u201cFortunately Crucible had the presence of mind to come after it with the gravel rake, and it flew away before it could do Milady any harm, but she wasn\u2019t pleased at all. I had to give them free pudding all around and two complimentary bottles of Black Gabekrian.\u201d\nSmith winced. \u201cThat\u2019s expensive.\u201d\n\u201cNot as expensive as Milady\u2019s bullies coming down here and burning the hotel over our heads. What if the little beast had managed to pull out her earring and then flown off with it, Smith?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019d finish us, all right.\u201d Smith rubbed his chin. \u201cI\u2019d better go see if I can buy some poison at Leadbeater\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we simply call in an exterminator?\u201d Mrs. Smith puffed smoke.\n\u201cNo! They charge a duke\u2019s ransom. Leadbeater\u2019s got something, he swears it does the job or your money back.\u201d\nMrs. Smith looked doubtful. \u201cBut there was this fellow in the marketplace only the other day, had a splendid pitch. \u2018Are you afflicted with DRAGONS?\u2019 he shouted. Stood up on the steps of Rakut\u2019s monument, you know, and gave this speech about his secret guaranteed methods. Produced a list of testimonials as long as your arm, all from grateful customers whose premises he\u2019d ridded of wyrmin.\u201d\nSmith grunted. \u201cAnd he\u2019d charge a duke\u2019s ransom and turn out to be a charlatan.\u201d\nMrs. Smith shrugged. \u201cHave it your way, then. Just don\u2019t put it off any longer, or we\u2019ll be facing a lawsuit at the very least.\u201d\nLeadbeater\u2019s & Son\u2019s was an old and respected firm, three dusty floors\u2019 worth of ironmongery with a bar in the cellar. Great numbers of the city\u2019s population of males of a certain age disappeared through its doors for long hours at a time; some of them practically lived there. Smith was by no means immune to its enchantment.\nRegardless of what he needed, Smith generally began with climbing up to the third floor to stare at Bluesteel\u2019s Patented Improved Spring-driven Harvester, a gleaming mystery of wheels, gears, blades, leather straps, and upholstery, wherein a man might ride at his leisure while simultaneously cutting down five acres of wheat. Mr. Bluesteel had assembled it there for the first Mr. Leadbeater, long years since, and there it sat still, because it was so big no one had been able to get it down the stairs and the only other option was taking off the roof and hoisting it out with a crane.\nSmith had a long satisfying gawk at it, and then continued on his usual progress: down to the second floor to browse among the Small Iron Goods, to see whether there were any hinges, bolts, screws, or nails he needed, or whether there might be anything new and stylish in the way of drawer pulls or doorknobs. Down, then, to the ground floor, where he idled wistfully among the tools in luxuriant profusion, from the bins full of cheap hammers to the really expensive patent wonders locked behind glass. At last, sadly (for he could not admit to himself that he really needed a clockwork reciprocating saw that could cut through iron bars with its special diamond-dust attachment), Smith wandered back through the barrels of paint and varnish to the Compounds area, where young Mr. Leadbeater sat behind the counter doing sums on a wax tablet.\n\u201cLeadbeater\u2019s son,\u201d said Smith by way of greeting.\n\u201cSmith-from-the-hotel,\u201d replied young Leadbeater, for there were a lot of Smiths in Salesh-by-the-Sea. He stuck his stylus behind his ear and stood. \u201cHow may I serve? Roofing pitch? Pipe sealant? Drain cleaner?\u201d\n\u201cWhat have you got for dragons?\u201d\n\u201cAh! We have an excellent remedy.\u201d Young Leadbeater gestured for Smith to follow him and went sidling back between the rows of bins. \u201cTinplate\u2019s Celebrated Gettemol! Very cleverly conceived. Here we are.\u201d He raised the lid on a bin. It was full of tiny pellets in a riot of brilliant colors.\n\u201cIt looks delicious,\u201d said Smith.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what your wyrmin will think,\u201d said young Leadbeater. \u201cThey\u2019ll see this and they\u2019ll leave off hunting fish, see? They\u2019ll fill their craws with it and, tchac! It\u2019ll kill them dead. How bad is your infestation?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole damned colony of them on the roof,\u201d said Smith.\n\u201cWell. You\u2019ll want a week\u2019s worth\u2014I can sell you a couple of buckets to carry it in\u2014and for that kind of volume we throw in a statue of Cliba and the Cliba Prayer, put a shrine where the dragons can see it and keeps \u2019em from coming back, very efficacious\u2014and then of course you\u2019ll need new roofing and gutters once you\u2019ve cleaned your dragon colony out\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cBecause if you\u2019ve got that many of them on your roof, ten to one they\u2019ve been prying up the leading to hide things under it, and once their droppings get underneath on your roof beams, they eat right through, and you don\u2019t want that, trust me. Highly corrosive droppings, dragons. Just about impossible to get the stink out of plaster, too. Had them long?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019d always been a couple,\u201d said Smith. \u201cWe\u2019re at the damned seaside, right? You expect them. But in the last month or two we\u2019ve got some kind of wyrmin rookery up there.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I daresay it\u2019s the weather. Lot of people coming in with the same trouble. Well, let me fetch you a pair of good big buckets . . . \u201d\n\u201cYes, but no roofing stuff just yet, all right?\u201d Smith followed him over to the Containers section. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until I get up there and see how bad it is. And what do I do with it? Just scatter it around? We\u2019ve got a baby at our place, and I wouldn\u2019t want him picking it up and eating it.\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. You\u2019ve got a big tree on your grounds, haven\u2019t you? Just hang the buckets in the tree branches. Neat and tidy. They\u2019re naturally curious, see? They\u2019ll fly down to eat it, and then all you\u2019ll need to do is call the umbrella-makers,\u201d said young Leadbeater, with a grin.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Smith was mystified until he remembered the commercial uses for dragon wings. \u201cOh! Right. Will they come and collect the dead ones for us?\u201d\n\u201cUsually. You can get a good price for them, too.\u201d Young Leadbeater winked.\nSmith trudged home with two gallon buckets of Tinplate\u2019s Celebrated Gettemol, and the little statue of Cliba\u2014a minor god of banishments\u2014with its prayer on a slip of paper, in his pocket. He set a ladder against the trunk of the big canopy-pine and, climbing the ladder, went up himself to hang the buckets where they would be clearly visible. While up there, he peered across at his roof, but saw no gaping holes evident. Whistling, he climbed back down and spent the rest of the afternoon in the work shed making a shrine for Cliba out of an old winejar.\nNext morning, Smith was carrying a case of pickles up from the hotel\u2019s cellar when he heard Mrs. Smith calling him, with thunder in her voice. He emerged to find her clutching her grandchild.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better go and see what Baby found when I took him outdoors for his sunbath,\u201d she said grimly. Smith, expecting a dead dragon, sighed and trudged off to the garden, followed closely by Mrs. Smith. When he stepped through the back door, he beheld the garden and back terrace scattered with thousands of rainbow-colored pellets.\n\u201cAnd guess what Baby went straight for, when I set him down? \u2018Yum yum, look at all this candy!\u2019\u201d said Mrs. Smith.\n\u201cGods below!\u201d Smith looked up into the tree and saw the two empty pails swinging on one end of gnawed-through cord. Five or six dragons perched along the branch above it, watching Smith with what looked like malicious glee in their little slit-pupiled eyes. As Smith stared, they defecated in unison and flew back to the hotel\u2019s roof.\n\u201cI trust you\u2019ll have Mr. Crucible sweep it up immediately,\u201d said Mrs. Smith with icy hauteur.\n\u201cDamned right I will,\u201d said Smith. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m taking it back to Leadbeater\u2019s and demanding a refund.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what\u2019ll you do then?\u201d\nSmith rubbed the back of his neck, scowling. \u201cGo ask a priest for intercession?\u201d\n\u201cA fat lot of good that\u2019ll do! What self-respecting god gets rid of household pests, Smith? No, go and do what we ought to have done in the first place and hire a professional. There\u2019s that fellow in the marketplace. \u2018Are you afflicted with DRAGONS?\u2019 and all that. A big fellow in oilskins. One-eyed.\u201d\nAfter a brief unpleasant interview with the Leadbeaters father and son, Smith walked out of their emporium counting his money. He put his wallet away, and, sighing, looked around. He spotted the column of Duke Rakut\u2019s monument, two streets away.\n\u201cMay as well,\u201d Smith muttered to himself. Picking his way between fishnets spread out for mending, he made his way over to the marketplace in Rakut Square.\nApproaching the monument, Smith saw only a skinny youth seated on its steps, next to a handcart loaded with empty cages. The youth, who had a rather bruised and melancholy look to him, was feeding shrimp to a fat little dragon perched on his shoulder. The dragon ate greedily. The youth watched it with a mother\u2019s tender regard.\n\u201cIs there a man hereabouts says he can get rid of those?\u201d Smith inquired, staring at the dragon. He had never seen a tame one before.\n\u201cThat\u2019d b-be my m-m-master,\u201d said the youth, not meeting Smith\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWell, where is he?\u201d\nBy way of answer, the youth pointed at the wine shop across the way.\n\u201cBack soon?\u201d\nThe youth nodded. Smith sat down on the steps to wait. The dragon climbed bat-like down to the youth\u2019s knee and squeaked at Smith. It ducked its head and shook its wings, which resembled fine red leather, at him.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it doing?\u201d\n\u201cSh-she\u2019s begging you for t-t-treats,\u201d said the youth.\n\u201cHuh.\u201d Smith scratched his head. \u201cSmart dragon.\u201d The youth nodded. The dragon waited expectantly for treats, and, when none were forthcoming from Smith, it squealed angrily at him and clambered back up the front of the youth\u2019s tunic, where it settled down to groom itself, now and then casting an indignant glance at Smith.\nA man emerged from the wine shop. Smith, watching him as he walked across the square, saw that he was big, wore a curious long coat made of oilskin, and had one eye. A leather patch hid where the other had been. The man was red-faced and genial-looking, even more so than might be accounted for by having just emerged from a wine shop.\n\u201cC-c-customer, Master,\u201d said the youth. The man rubbed his hands together, grinning at Smith.\n\u201cAre you, sir? Are you afflicted with\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDragons, yes, I am. What\u2019re your rates like?\u201d\n\u201cI will completely eradicate your dragons for absolutely free!\u201d the man told him. His voice was a hoarse bawl. He grabbed Smith\u2019s hand in his gauntleted own and shook it heartily.\n\u201cFree! What\u2019s the catch?\u201d\n\u201cNo catch, my friend. Etterin Crankhandle, at your service. And let me tell you what those services include! No appointment necessary. I will personally come to your premises and arrange for on-site removal of any and all dragons infesting your property. All wyrmin are humanely trapped\u2014no dangerous poisons or other chemical preparations used. I will then conduct a complete and thorough examination of your roof, shed, or outbuildings, and remove any nests or caches and repair any damage I find such as loose leading, tiles, or slates. I, of course, reserve the right to any contents of said nests or caches. Your roof, shed, or outbuildings will then be sprayed with my Miracle Wyrm Repellent, guaranteed to prevent any reinfestation for a full year. All absolutely free. Interested?\u201d\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d run into you before I spent a fortune on that Gettemol crap,\u201d said Smith, panting as he helped Crankhandle and his assistant push their cart up the street. Crankhandle laughed and shook his head.\n\u201cAh, sir, if I had a gold crown for every time I\u2019d heard someone say that, I\u2019d be a wealthy man!\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to charge something, then,\u201d said Smith, leaning away from the dragon on the youth\u2019s shoulder, as it stuck its neck out and nipped at him.\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Crankhandle. \u201cThe dragons themselves are payment enough. And in any case, you wouldn\u2019t have found me there before last month. I\u2019m new here.\u201d\n\u201cA traveler, then?\u201d\n\u201cI am, sir. Have to be. When I clear wyrmin out of a town, they don\u2019t come back. Pretty soon business dries up, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it would. Here we are,\u201d said Smith, opening the garden gate. They wheeled the cart in over the lawn and parked it under the canopy-pine. As Crankhandle\u2019s assistant scrambled to slide chocks under the wheels, Crankhandle turned and peered up at the roof. The dragons looked down at him. Crankhandle grinned wide. Smith saw that his teeth had been capped with gold.\n\u201cThere you are! Uncle\u2019s come with treats, my little darlings. Oh, yes he has.\u201d\nSmith went indoors, got a beer, and came back out to watch as the youth unloaded all the cages from the cart. He set them up in a row and opened each one. His master, meanwhile, opened a panel in the floor of the cart, and, from a recess, brought out an iron strongbox. When he opened it, Smith glimpsed a dense greenish stuff, looking like damp compressed sawdust. Crankhandle broke off a cake of it and went to each of the cages, baiting each cage with bits of the cake. The dragon on his assistant\u2019s shoulder turned its head and watched jealously. It began to squeak, doing the same head-bobbing and wing-fluttering routine it had gone through at Smith.\n\u201cHere you are, little sweeting,\u201d said Crankhandle, holding out a morsel of the stuff. The little dragon snapped at it avidly and gobbled it down. \u201cThat\u2019s the way. Now! Arvin, send her up there.\u201d\nThe youth Arvin took the dragon in both his hands. He kissed the top of her head\u2014she tried to bite him\u2014and tossed her up in the air toward the roof. She unfolded her wings and flew to the roofline, landing among the other dragons there. They hissed at her, but only for a moment; presumably, they had caught the scent of the cake on her jaws, for they suddenly mobbed her, biting her in their excitement, snapping at crumbs. She squawked and fled, jumping off the edge and flapping back down to Arvin\u2019s waiting hands. He clutched her to himself and dodged behind the open cages, holding her against his chest protectively as the other dragons came winging after her.\nBut the whole flock\u2014and Smith saw now there were a lot more than a dozen, more like twenty\u2014pulled up and wheeled in midair as they noticed the bait. For a moment there was a confusion of beating wings, loud as spattering rain on rock, and then each dragon had zipped into one of the cages and was ravenously eating the green cake. Crankhandle stepped forward and slammed the cages shut, one after another. Arvin stepped around to help him, as his dragon scrambled back on his shoulder.\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s done,\u201d said Crankhandle, beating his gauntlets together. Arvin\u2019s dragon peeped and begged. \u201cAnd here\u2019s your reward, good girl!\u201d Crankhandle added, going to the strongbox and taking out a last bit of cake. He handed it to Arvin to feed to her and then put the strongbox back in its compartment, shutting the panel.\n\u201cDamn,\u201d said Smith. Crankhandle swung round to him, grinning, and held up an index finger.\n\u201cBut wait! I have not completed my comprehensive removal! Arvin, get the ladder.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Master,\u201d said Arvin, as the dragon screamed in temper and bit him because the last of the cake was gone. He dabbed absentmindedly at the blood streaming from his ear and went to pull an extendable ladder from the side of the cart.\nCrankhandle loaded a basket with tools, and, slinging it on his back, climbed the ladder one-handed, while Smith steadied the ladder for him and Arvin loaded the cages back on the cart. Arvin sustained a number of other bites doing this, amid tremendous racket, because the dragon flock was in a group rage and hurling themselves against the bars; but Arvin kept working and only paused to tie a couple of bandages on his wounds before throwing netting over the cart\u2019s top to fasten everything down.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it figured out,\u201d said Smith, who had wandered over to watch the dragons once Crankhandle was safely on the roof. \u201cHe sells the little bastards to the umbrella-makers, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\nArvin shot him a pained look. \u201cN-n-n-n-n-no!\u201d he said reproachfully. \u201cHe l-lets them g-go. G-goes inland a l-long way and r-releases them. G-gone for w-weeks sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cAha,\u201d said Smith. \u201cYes, of course.\u201d\nCrankhandle was up on the roof a long while, scraping and clunking and hammering. Mrs. Smith came out to see what was going on, and, on learning, was very pleased indeed with Smith, so much so that she went back indoors to prepare his favorite fried eel for dinner.\nHaving repaired the leads, removed the nests, and dug dragon shit out of all the raingutters, Crankhandle came back down the ladder at last, looking smug.\n\u201cVery nice haul,\u201d he said, slinging the basket down and pulling a tank with a spraying-rig from under the cart. Smith got up and looked in the basket. He glimpsed something bright glinting among the ruin of nests and flat sun-dried dragon corpses.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something gold in here\u2014\u201d Smith reached for it, but Crankhandle whirled around with the tank in his hands.\n\u201cAh-ah-ah! That\u2019s my perquisite, sir. \u2018Contents of said nests or caches\u2019, I said, didn\u2019t I? Anything I found up there\u2019s mine, see? Or I can just let the little dears loose again, and I shouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d want that, not with the spiteful mood they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d said Smith, but he brushed aside the rubbish for a better look anyway. His jaw dropped. In the bottom of the basket was a clutch of gold crown-pieces, a gold anklet, a silver bracelet set with moonstones, a length of gold chain, three gold signet rings, the brass mouthpiece from a trumpet, assorted earrings . . .\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Smith grabbed out a gold stickpin, a skull with ruby eyes. \u201cThis is mine! Went missing from my washstand!\u201d\n\u201cMine now, mate,\u201d said Crankhandle, shaking his head. \u201cThose were my terms. Wyrmin steal bright metal; everybody knows that. Anyplace they nest, there\u2019s going to be a hoard. Now you know how I can afford to do this free of charge.\u201d\n\u201cWell yes, but . . . \u201d Smith turned the stickpin in his fingers. \u201cCome on. This was a gift. A gift from a demon-lord, if you want to know, and I wouldn\u2019t want to offend him by losing it. Can\u2019t I keep just this pin? Trade you for it.\u201d\n\u201cSuch as what?\u201d Crankhandle was busy fastening the tank\u2019s harness on his back.\n\u201cLady of the house is a gourmet cook. Seriously, the Grandview\u2019s restaurant rated five cups in the city guide. Exclusive, understand? All the lords and ladies are regulars here, so you can imagine the wine cellar\u2019s stocked with nothing but the best. We\u2019ll give you the finest table and serve you the finest meal you\u2019ll ever eat in your life, eh? And whatever you like to drink, as much as you can hold!\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Crankhandle\u2019s eye gleamed. \u201cRight, then; you get the table ready. I\u2019m just going up to finish the job. I warn you, I\u2019ve got a good appetite.\u201d\nHe wasn\u2019t joking. Crankhandle set his elbows on the table and worked his way through a whole moorfowl stuffed with rice and ground peas, a crown roast of venison with a blackberry-red wine reduction sauce, golden fried saffron crab cakes, two glasses of apricot liqueur, and a quart and a half of porter. Smith played the companionable host and took his dinner of fried eel at the table with his guest, watching in awe as the man ate and drank. He took it on himself to have some fried eel sent out to Arvin as well, marooned in the garden keeping watch over the cages.\nRefilling Crankhandle\u2019s glass, Smith inquired: \u201cHow did you get into this line of business, if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d\n\u201cHa-ha!\u201d Crankhandle belched, grinned, and placed a slightly unsteady finger beside his nose. \u201cThat\u2019s the story, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s for pudding? Got any fruitcake?\u201d\nSmith waved down one of the waiters and told him to bring out a fruitcake.\n\u201cHow\u2019d I get into my line of business. Well. Always interested in dragons, from the time I was a kid. I grew up back in the grainlands, see, way inland. Way upriver. And the dragons, you know, they\u2019re bigger there\u2014twice the size of these little buggers. I remember standing on the tail of my father\u2019s cart and watching \u2019em cruise across the sky, just gliding, you know, on these scarlet wings. Most beautiful thing I\u2019d ever seen in my life. Ah!\u201d\nThe waiter brought the fruitcake to the table. It was dark, solid, drenched in liquor, heavy as a couple of bricks, and covered in molten sugar, and the mere sight of it was enough to give Smith indigestion. The waiter deftly set out a plate and took up his cake knife, poised to serve. \u201cHow big a slice would Sir like?\u201d\n\u201cLeave the whole thing,\u201d said Crankhandle, a bit testily. The waiter looked sidelong at Smith, who nodded. The waiter set the fruitcake on the table and left. Crankhandle seized the knife and, a little unsteadily, sawed out a slice. Gloating, he held it up to the candle, so the light shone through the red and amber and green fruit. \u201cLook at that! Looks like jewels. Looks like a dragon\u2019s trove. Nothing about them isn\u2019t beautiful, dragons.\u201d He stuffed the slice of cake in his mouth and cut himself another.\n\u201cSo anyway\u2014I wanted to know everything about \u2019em, growing up. Asked everybody in my village what they knew about dragons. Nobody knew much. Used to watch the dragons dive in the river for fish. Found out the sorts of things they like to eat when they can\u2019t get fish, found out what they physic themselves with when they\u2019re ill, that sort of thing.\n\u201cAnd then, one time, I followed one back to the cliffs where it nested and climbed up there to have a look, and that was when I found its hoard. All this gold! Nobody in my village had any, you can be sure. I reached in and grabbed this goblet with rubies on it\u2014got my arm bitten pretty badly too\u2014and carried it home.\n\u201cThe schoolmaster had a look at it and said it was old. Come out of some old king\u2019s tomb somewhere, he said. The mayor said it likely had a curse on it and he confiscated it, to keep the curse off me, he said, but he was a greedy bastard and I knew he wanted it for himself. Pour me some more of that apricot stuff, eh?\u201d\nSmith obliged him. Crankhandle grinned craftily, took a mouthful of liqueur, and leaned quickly toward the candle. He swallowed, belched. The candle flame shot out sideways for a second, a jet of fire.\n\u201cIs that how dragons do it?\u201d said Smith.\n\u201cNo. See, that\u2019s a popular misconception about dragons, that they breathe fire. I\u2019m here to tell you they don\u2019t, and I\u2019d know. Been studying \u2019em my whole life. I know more about dragons than anybody else in the world, now.\u201d Crankhandle cut himself a huge slab of cake, took half of it in one bite, and chewed thoughtfully.\n\u201cSuch as?\u201d\n\u201cSuch as, they\u2019re smart. They can learn things. I learned to train \u2019em. Mind you, it isn\u2019t easy\u2014\u201d Crankhandle pointed at the patch covering his eye socket\u2014\u201cbecause they\u2019re willful, and temperamental, and quick. You have to want them more than an eye, or a fingertip, or an earlobe. The boy\u2019s learning that. The other thing is, you can only really train wyrmin to do better what they already want to do anyway.\u201d He reached for the knife to cut the last quarter of fruitcake into eighths, changed his mind, and simply picked up the whole wedge and bit into it.\n\u201cWell. So I learned all there was to know about dragons, see? Discovered a secret, and I didn\u2019t learn it from any priests or mages either, I worked it out for myself. There\u2019s something dragons need in their diets\u2014and I\u2019m not telling you what it is, but it\u2019s either animal, vegetable, or mineral, ha ha\u2014and if they don\u2019t get it, they don\u2019t grow. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so puny, here by the sea. Lots of fish, but no Mystery Ingredient. So I worked out a special food formula for dragons, right? A little of this, a little of that, a lot of the Mystery Ingredient, and that\u2019s my bait.\n\u201cNot even the boy knows the recipe. I make it up myself, in a locked room. And the little bastards love it! Can\u2019t get enough of it. Have to be careful doling it out to them, because they do get bigger when they eat it, and you can spend a fortune on cages. But oh, how they come to the bait!\u201d\n\u201cSo . . . you travel around with this stuff, cleaning out wyrmin colonies, and collecting all the gold they\u2019ve stolen and hoarded,\u201d said Smith. \u201cYou must have earned a fortune by now! But if it\u2019s that dangerous, why don\u2019t you retire?\u201d\n\u201cHaven\u2019t made enough yet,\u201d said Crankhandle, pouring himself some more liqueur. \u201cI\u2019m saving it up. You might say I\u2019ve got a hoard of my own. Besides, this isn\u2019t where the real money is!\u201d\n\u201cOh no?\u201d\n\u201cNo indeed. Rings and pins and bracelets . . . ha. That\u2019s the petty stuff the little ones bring in. They\u2019re not strong enough to lift anything bigger. You don\u2019t get a real payoff until you\u2019ve got the big ones troving for you.\u201d\n\u201cTroving?\u201d\n\u201cGoing out looking for gold. It\u2019s instinctive. The big dragons where I grew up, they could tell where there was old gold. Tombs, mounds, other dragons\u2019 hoards. You should see their nests! I told you how I got this, didn\u2019t I?\u201d He rolled up his oilskin sleeve to reveal a brawny arm, tattooed with swirling patterns, and a distinct U-shape of white scarred toothmarks.\n\u201cYou did. Stealing a cup.\u201d\n\u201cRight, well, I learned that what you do is, you get \u2019em when they\u2019re little enough to be easily managed, and you train \u2019em, see? You get \u2019em used to you. You get \u2019em so they believe they\u2019d better do what you want \u2019em to do, to get those lovely wyrmin treats. And then you feed \u2019em so they get of a bigness to raid tombs and such, and you take \u2019em back into the inlands where the old places are and you let \u2019em go.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s just a matter of making a chart of where they build their nests and going around every now and then to see what they\u2019ve collected for you. They remember me, old Uncle Treats, and I dump out a great sack of special formula for \u2019em, and while they\u2019re busy gobbling it down, I can take what I like out of the hoard. Works every time!\u201d\n\u201cYou ought to be stinking rich pretty soon, all the same,\u201d said Smith in awe. \u201cGoing to retire and pass your secret on to the boy?\u201d\nCrankhandle made a face. He drained his glass and shook his head. \u201cNo. He\u2019s a bit of a fool, really. Good enough for pulling the cart, but he\u2019s too soft for the work. He loves dragons, like they were people. And, you know, you really can\u2019t love, in this business.\u201d He reached for the emptied bottle and tilted it, sticking his tongue up the neck to get the last drops.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lot like a dragon, yourself,\u201d said Smith.\nCrankhandle belched and grinned, and his gold teeth glinted in the candlelight. \u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d he said.\nThat night, Smith put his stickpin away in a drawer. It had occurred to him that there was another thing Crankhandle might have trained his wyrmin to do, and that was to fly through open windows and rob houses. The more he thought about it, the more he wondered whether the sudden infestation at the Grandview had happened entirely by chance.\nBut the dragons did not return, at least. When next Milady from the pink palace stopped in as one of a party ordering lunch on the terrace, she asked, with an unpleasant smile, whether she was likely to be attacked by an animal again. Smith assured her that all the dragons had been exterminated, which seemed to please her.\nSix months later, Smith had business down in Rakut Square. He glanced at the base of the monument as he walked by, and saw no cart. He thought to himself that Crankhandle must have moved on to another city.\nHe was a little surprised, therefore, as he walked back toward the Grandview, to find the boy Arvin mending a fishing net. The little dragon was still perched on his shoulder, sleepily basking in the sunlight. She opened one slit-pupiled eye to regard Smith and then closed it, dismissing him as not worth her attention.\n\u201cHello!\u201d said Smith. \u201cWhere\u2019s your master these days?\u201d\nArvin looked up at him. He shook his head sadly. \u201cDead,\u201d he replied.\n\u201cDead! How?\u201d\n\u201cHe t-told you about the b-bait we used, how it m-makes dragons bigger?\u201d\n\u201cRight, he did.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes them s-smarter, too.\u201d\nOriginally published in The Dragon Book, edited by Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois.\nOne of the most prolific new writers to appear in the late '90s, the late Kage Baker made her first sale in 1997, with \"Noble Mold,\" the first of her long sequence of sly and compelling stories of the adventures and misadventures of the time-traveling agents of the Company.

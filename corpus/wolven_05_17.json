Man discovers philosophy. Man discovers boredom.\n What is it about the squatting position, Mary Ellund wondered, looking down at Paul\u2019s bent back, that calls to mind contemplative pursuits?\n The breeze picked up, the forest shivered. A thatch of red cedar boughs, two hundred feet above, shook down droplets on her head. Mary pulled up her field hat and tugged the drawstrings tight under her chin. Staggering down the uneven trail, she had to catch at nearby tree trunks to keep from falling in the mud. The Cascade Mountains were wet this time of year, as they were most times of year, with the exception of the punishing summer droughts. A dewy coolness hung in the air. The earth was plush with moss. Both Mary and the young scientist below her were black to the shins with mud.\n \u201cYup,\u201d said Paul, squatting in the muck. And then, in what Mary had noticed was a tic for him, \u201cYuh-up.\u201d His finger traced an oblong impression in the ground. \u201cVery cool.\u201d\n Paul was a nice kid, a brilliant kid. But he had the maddening daftness of a brainy boy. Mary stood above him, trying to see what he saw. Paul shifted on his haunches, poking at the turf. Like a caveman on the verge of a prehistoric eureka, she thought. Wheels and fire. Language and religion.\n \u201cAre we close?\u201d Mary wiped her neck, wondering how it was possible to sweat so much in such chill weather.\n Paul squinted, blinked three times, and traced the oblong shape again.\n \u201cHere\u2019s where the heel went in. See the pressure ridge? That\u2019s what we call a mid-tarsal break. Means the foot flexes more than a human foot. And the toe. You can see how it curled, gripped.\u201d He blinked again. \u201cThat\u2019s a really wonderful big toe.\u201d\n Paul Yu, he\u2019d told her, smiling at the rhyme, was from Wisconsin U. He was a top biologist from what had become the country\u2019s top biology school. But he wasn\u2019t a terribly good explainer.\n Mary squatted to study the footprint. She saw a single cuplike depression, filled with brown water, a few floating, spinning blades of grass. If not for Paul, she\u2019d never have known it was a footprint, much less the notorious footprint they were seeking.\n \u201cCan you date it? I mean, can you tell when it was made?\u201d\n \u201cOh, yuh-up.\u201d Paul, as usual, answered a slightly different question than the one she\u2019d asked. \u201cThey\u2019re around here. Definitely. Somewhere nearby.\u201d\n It was then Mary felt it. Like an intake of breath, a gathering of attention.\n Paul squatted on his heels below her, very still, looking down the trail to the far side of the valley. When Mary moved to stand, he twitched a finger. She crouched in the moss, half obscured by a spray of ferns.\n And saw them.\n Four creatures stood on the far side of the gully. One male, three females. Even at a distance, Mary identified the sexes, though at this remove the animals made no sound. They browsed a stand of huckleberries high up the northern slope, in a shadowed band where firs grew thick and the hush of the rain seemed to gather like a shroud. The male\u2014oh, but he was a beautiful specimen, wonderfully tall, furred with brown across his massive chest. Mary reflected with a girlish joy that his movements, though slow, even ponderous, had a dignity in life they would not have had on film.\n \u201cThey\u2019re so\u2014\u201d she began, and wondered what to say next. Strange? Solid? Real? But she noticed Paul staring.\n Right. Mary reached for her belt. She felt terribly exposed, squatting on the trail, but it would be dangerously conspicuous to dart for cover. She forced herself to move with a hunter\u2019s patience as she touched the device that hung at her hip.\n Her thumb fumbled plastic and steel. The creatures continued their foraging, eating with the loose-lipped gusto of gorillas, stuffing whole branches into their mouths and pulling out denuded sticks. Even as Mary\u2019s mind overflowed with adjectives\u2014so stately! so exotic! so sad!\u2014she felt the button under her thumb and pushed it down.\n The click of the shutter seemed to crack through the forest, loud as a falling stone. The little band across the valley never noticed. They went on with their meal as Mary\u2019s recorder whirred. Mary could hear the shutter working, the device zooming in and out. Tiny lenses ticked like an optometrist\u2019s phoropter.\n There was no need for her to move, to take aim, to disrupt in any way the sublime unreality of the moment. Once activated, the recorder was automatic.\n Mary let her soul settle into a state of rich receptivity. Neolithic men must have felt this way, she thought, as they stalked their game through archaic forests. Now only scientists were quite so observant.\n She felt as if a book had closed, a curtain fallen, when Paul whispered, \u201cDo you have enough?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Mary straightened, knees cracking. At her movement, the creatures turned. By the time she stood erect, they had disappeared, vanishing over the ridgetop into the wild.\n In camp, Ken and Malia were setting out lunch, stuffing packets of soup into the porto-heater, propping up camping chairs amid rain-sodden ferns. They paused in their work, waiting, as Mary and Paul came down the trail, Mary cradling the recorder like a relic at her chest.\n \u201cWell?\u201d Ken had the look he\u2019d been wearing all morning, the tightlipped pout of a man who expected to be enraged.\n Mary brought the recorder to her tablet, propped on a cooler by the tent. Within three feet, the devices synched, began a transfer. \u201cWe saw them.\u201d\n \u201cYou did. And?\u201d\n Mary turned to Ken. In spite of herself, she liked what she saw: lean hiker\u2019s body, clad in denim and plaid, sacks of miso soup clutched in each strong fist. Whatever else you might say of him, Ken Takamura was a striking man.\n \u201cAnd,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201cthe reports are true. Actually, it\u2019s worse than we feared.\u201d\n Ken cursed. He was twenty years Mary\u2019s junior, unknown to her till this week, but he turned his back like a father disappointed in his child. At a motion of his hand, a sack of soup slopped into a bowl. Ken smacked the porto-heater shut. With a thrust of his chin he indicated Mary\u2019s recorder.\n \u201cYou have pictures?\u201d\n Mary lowered her eyes. All the fantasy and joy of the morning, the delight of their discovery on the trail, drizzled away into the muck underfoot.\n \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n With their instant meals warmed and devoured, the soda cans drained, trash carefully cached, coffee perked and the creamer supplied, Mary led everyone into the tent.\n The drizzle of the mountains had built to a squall, one of those rattling gusts that swept the valleys, shaking reservoirs of rain from the cedars, setting the ferns to frenzied kowtowing.\n Most of the tent was taken up with a table, lightweight and collapsible, scattered with papers. Mary set up her equipment, plugged the recorder into the tablet, the tablet into the printer, the printer into the power source. She slipped in a gravure. The system puffed as it went to work.\n \u201cI took a look at the digitals back on the trail. I think we should all take some time to talk this over. Going by what Paul and I saw, we need to be absolutely sure we get this right.\u201d\n Their faces, gray in the rainy light, were grim. Like hospital visitors, Mary thought, wishing away bad news. She shifted behind her equipment, defensive.\n \u201cYou really think this is necessary?\u201d Ken crossed his arms. \u201cThis little dog and pony show? You don\u2019t want to get back to D.C.?\u201d\n Ken, Mary thought, Ken is the difficult one. On every field investigation, she\u2019d dealt with a person like this. People\u2014especially people who worked for the government\u2014bristled at the presence of D.C. bureaucrats nosing around their turf. Plenty of folks disapproved of her very line of work.\n Mary took the first gravure from the printer, held it up for all to see. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019ll review this as a group. We\u2019ll discuss it as a group. I want to hear what everyone has to say.\u201d\n The picture made its way around the table. Mary knew the research on human attention: people spend more time with printed media. She always marveled when she saw the effect in person. How people linger on a physical printout, turn it over, even stroke it\u2014all quite different from the skimming and skipping with which humans greet digital documents. Hence Mary\u2019s use of gravures in her work. They felt important, weighty, real.\n \u201cThat\u2019s a picture of the youngest female,\u201d Mary said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need a medical degree to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n Even Paul spent time with the gravure, blinking as he held it at arm\u2019s length. He\u2019d been at Mary\u2019s side, living the moment, inhaling its strangeness, its truth. But he needed this picture, in some primitive way, to convince him it was credible.\n \u201cWe\u2019re sure this is verifiable? Not a hoax?\u201d Malia frowned as she passed the picture to Ken. Malia worked with Mary at the Executive Bioethics Agency, in offices formerly part of the EPA. A law school whiz who\u2019d switched to regulation, she\u2019d made a wise choice. Biotech was booming. And with it, biohazards.\n Size brought bureaucracy. Malia\u2019s title at the agency was Acting Relations Manager. What that meant, Mary had no idea. Some unholy hybrid, she gathered, of a DC lawyer and a PR flack.\n \u201cWhat kind of hoax do you think it would be, Malia?\u201d\n \u201cA prosthesis? A publicity stunt? A group of protesters who snuck into the park? So far, we only have photodocumentation. We could be dealing with nothing but a woman in a suit.\u201d\n \u201cI spent ten years as an OB/GYN.\u201d Mary cocked an eyebrow. \u201cI\u2019ve seen fake pregnancies. That\u2019s no prosthesis.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a woman in a suit.\u201d Paul tapped the gravure. \u201cNot with this gait.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an outside specimen,\u201d Malia persisted. \u201cSomething introduced from outside the park.\u201d\n Mary spread her hands. \u201cKen? Thoughts?\u201d\n \u201cI can tell you this.\u201d The forest ranger reached for a pocket. \u201cWhatever happened, it happened inside the boundary.\u201d Ken pulled out an image of his own, what the foresters called a snap-map. A cube the size of his fist, it unfolded to show data-rich views of the North Cascades National Park.\n \u201cWe maintain seven perimeters, automatically patrolled.\u201d Ken traced ragged lines on the map. \u201cOne along the boundary, including the national border. Five areas within that. This one has everything west of Ross Lake. There\u2019s a special zone, just for the range of the\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cThe creatures. Anything crossing those borders gets noticed, logged, reported. I mean anything. These are microcams. Pollen-sized. We don\u2019t install them, we dump them. Like, from planes. We\u2019re talking millions of eyes. Comprehensive surveillance.\u201d\n \u201cArtificial eyes,\u201d Malia said.\n Ken\u2019s jaw jutted. \u201cWe have seventy-two federal rangers working for the protection of these animals. If you\u2019re implying that they aren\u2019t doing their jobs\u2014\u201d\n Malia showed her palms.\n \u201cLook.\u201d Ken hit the snap-map, zooming in on their current location, a CGI icon of their base camp. \u201cThe Parks Service didn\u2019t want to take these critters in. It was your report, ten years ago, that got the president\u2019s ear, set up this preserve. I was opposed to it then. I\u2019m opposed to it now. But I\u2019ve done my job. All my people have done their jobs. We\u2019ve kept a watch on these things. We\u2019ve kept them safe.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cNo protesters in our woods. No pranksters, no hoaxers. Whatever happened here, it\u2019s not our fault.\u201d\n Mary could see this man was going to try her patience. But there were plenty of people out there like him. They couldn\u2019t be ignored.\n \u201cAll right, Ken. No one\u2019s laying blame. We\u2019re trying to figure out how this could have happened.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019d better get rolling.\u201d Ken slapped the picture to the table, scooted it back. \u201cFrom the look of things, the situation\u2019s about to undergo\u201d\u2014he raised his eyebrows\u2014\u201ca rather drastic change.\u201d\n Mary caught the gravure with a slapping hand. Face down, it showed nothing, white plastic, a blank. She sighed.\n Here they sat, park ranger, state biologist, two suits from the Federal Triangle. Four pros, four bureaucratic boffins, doing their jobs.\n But what they concluded, in this little tent, would ramify through news shows, tabloids, journals, would bleed, click by click, into the gossip of the globe. Would become one of those key events, shocking, historic, never fully understood, that shift the trendlines of biology, politics, ethics.\n She flipped the picture. A hairy figure, six-and-a-half feet tall, half concealed by berry bushes, peeped from the print. So stately in life, it looked humped, ungainly, here, caught midstep\u2014and grossly unbalanced by the pale-furred swell below its dark-tipped breasts.\n The face. It was wrong, Mary thought, it was a monstrous. Like a joke played on the last million years of evolution.\n \u201cLet\u2019s start with the obvious.\u201d Mary loaded the gravure back into the printer, wiped it, lifted her eyes, confronted those three solemn faces. \u201cWe have a pregnant sasquatch on our hands.\u201d\n 2\n Weather is destiny, Mary thought. Weather is history, weather is psychology, weather is the past and the future.\n Then: Stop it, she chided herself. Don\u2019t get mystical. Clear head, clear sight. That\u2019s the way to get through this.\n Mary ducked under the overhang, outside the tent where they\u2019d been at it for hours, hunched over the plastic table. Checking pictures, checking possibilities. Despite all this effort, they\u2019d made little progress. They\u2019d reached nothing remotely close to an agreement.\n Mary blinked in a blast of rain. Running her OB/GYN practice, years ago, she\u2019d learned to deal with people in denial. Some denied they were pregnant. Some denied they were infertile. She knew the loopy feelings that the subject of reproduction stimulates, how arguments go in circles, how people get stuck. Even scientists.\n They were in danger of that now, badgering each other over side issues, shying clear of the key, deep questions. Mary needed a break. So she stood out here, with her coffee and thoughts, waxing mystical in the rain.\n Forested slopes rose above, culminating the bluish peak of Liumchen Mountain. Beyond was the Canadian border. Not much to see from here, only green and mist drifting up, the valley receding into a conquering grayness.\n It was a somber country. Drizzled, dim, and softly, sadly charming. Mary saw why so many poets had prowled for inspiration in these valleys, summered as firewatches on the stony heights. One hundred years ago, Jack Kerouac, zany Quebecois quester, had tramped the stark snows of Desolation Peak, dreaming of Dharma bums.\n They\u2019d all believed in going back to the land, back then. They\u2019d believed in mind-busting drugs and clear spring water and the cleansing effects of public nudity. What to call it, really, but a high-minded retreat into primitivism?\n Mary sipped coffee. Farther up, further north, lay the Fraser River Valley, the deep strange country of Harrison Lake. That was where it had started: the Bigfoot myth. In British Columbia, the Indian Agent J.W. Burns had collected tales from Native Americans. Salish inhabitants had told him of hairy wild folk prowling the Port Douglas hills. S\u00e1sq\u2019ets, in the native tongue, meant \u201cbenign-faced one.\u201d Or, according to a different source: \u201cclam-eater.\u201d\n Mary had loved it all as a kid. Not Bigfoot, exactly, not the beast itself. She loved the woods, the mystery, the vision of dark northern forests full of secrets. It had all seemed credible when she was a girl, with life a steady succession of discoveries. Even the land on which she stood hadn\u2019t been mapped until 1989, a mere eleven years before she was born.\n \u201cMary.\u201d\n She jumped, slopping coffee. Ken must have tiptoed out of the tent. A big man, well over six feet, he glared with a kind of possessiveness at the woods. The rain had increased, bringing on an early evening. Soon darkness, not mist, would hide these hills from sight.\n \u201cYou just about done out here?\u201d\n Mary mopped spilled coffee. \u201cSorry. Needed to catch my breath. This is getting exhausting.\u201d\n \u201cYou can\u2019t waste time,\u201d Ken said. \u201cYou need to decide what to do.\u201d\n Mary let the moment lengthen, watching rain shimmer down the hills.\n \u201cIt must be nice,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cLiving here.\u201d She considered Ken\u2019s casual attire, lumberjack shirt and pants. For the assignment, he\u2019d shucked his ranger\u2019s uniform, adopted this everyman outfit. Rather like a plainclothes cop, she thought, working undercover on a delicate case. \u201cAre you from this area?\u201d\n \u201cNope.\u201d Ken\u2019s mouth was a line. \u201cFrom Kyoto. Family came over when I was ten. To the States, I mean. We settled in San Francisco.\u201d He held out a hand, caught a palmful of rain. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to Washington till after college. Always wanted to be a forest ranger.\u201d\n \u201cFor the solitude,\u201d Mary guessed.\n Ken glanced at her with narrowed eyes. \u201cFor the work.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m not a nature buff. You know, we have slugs up here ten inches long? If it\u2019s not snowing, it\u2019s raining. If it\u2019s not raining, something\u2019s burning. But someone\u2019s got to stand guard\u2014over the forests.\u201d He laid a hand on a nearby cedar. \u201cDo you know why Japan is one of the world\u2019s great powers? It\u2019s a small island country. It\u2019s remote. Little mineral wealth, scant fossil fuels. It\u2019s got a unique culture, but that\u2019s not the main reason.\u201d He looked at Mary silently, enjoying her suspense. \u201cOur forests. That\u2019s why we\u2019re still going strong. We always looked after our forests. You protect your forests, you protect everything. Soil, freshwater, flora, and fauna.\u201d\n \u201cI bet Gary Snyder would agree with you, there.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n Mary dumped out the last few drops of coffee, rinsed her travel mug in the rain. \u201cA poet. American. He came to this place when he was young\u2014to these mountains. Fell in love with the countryside. Wrote a lot of poems about it, dragged other writers out here. Later, he moved to Japan to become a Buddhist monk. He was one of those counterculture types, believed in getting back to our roots, returning to the wilderness. He believed it was a way to find transcendence.\u201d She swished out her mug and slapped on the cap. \u201cKen, why do you think they did it?\u201d\n The ranger scowled in puzzlement before realizing whom she meant. \u201cHuh!\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWell, we know why they did it, don\u2019t we?\u201d\n \u201cDo we? Do we understand them? Is there a way for us to really understand?\u201d\n \u201cYou want to, what, read their minds? They\u2019re sasquatches, Mary. Apes. Dumb brutes. They don\u2019t have minds. Isn\u2019t that the whole point?\u201d\n \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d She turned back to the tent. \u201cIt just seems . . . \u201d\n Ken raised his eyebrows as she trailed off, holding up the tent flap for her to duck inside.\n \u201cIt seems,\u201d Mary said, \u201clike such a shame.\u201d\n Inside the tent, the air had gone dark green. It was five PM, coming on sunset. They\u2019d already wasted most of the day.\n \u201cWell,\u201d said Mary, going to the head of the table, \u201cwe\u2019ve been at this long enough. What have we learned?\u201d\n Malia had covered her workspace with gravures, printed versions of federal documents. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress.\u201d She licked a thumb, rubbed at a stain. \u201cKen IDed the sasquatches we saw, all four of them. I talked to folks in Archives. They pulled some records for us. We\u2019ve got a bio on your subject, Mary.\u201d\n \u201cGreat.\u201d Mary cleared a space for her coffee mug. \u201cWho is she?\u201d\n \u201cI think you mean,\u201d Ken said, \u201cwho was she.\u201d\n Malia sniffed at the correction, hunched over her keyboard. \u201cOur pregnant sasquatch is Miranda Watson. Caucasian, female at birth, thirty-three years old. That\u2019s her total age, including the human part of her lifespan. It\u2019s been seven years, now, since she devolved. She was born in Madison, Wisconsin. A fellow cheesehead, Paul.\u201d\n \u201cI only went to school in Wisconsin.\u201d Paul didn\u2019t look up from his tablet. \u201cI\u2019m not from there.\u201d\n \u201cLooks like a typical suburban childhood,\u201d Malia read on. \u201cYou know the story.\u201d She looked around the table, shrugging. \u201cRestless. Discontent. Miranda started showing interest in devolution in her teens. Her parents took her when she was seventeen to see the last living gorilla. A kind of pilgrimage. A life-changing event. The gorilla died shortly after. Miranda was hysterical. Aggressive therapy, behind in school.\u201d\n Malia flicked a finger, scrolling through text. \u201cThen Miranda hits twenty. A critical period. It was at this time her fascination became\u2014well, I guess you\u2019d call it a full-blown obsession.\u201d\n \u201cSilly term.\u201d Paul sniffed at his tablet. \u201cDevolution. So inaccurate.\u201d\n Mary poured her fourth cup of coffee. \u201cWhat kind of psychological profile are we looking at?\u201d\n Paul frowned. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be focusing on physiology?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll get to the physiology.\u201d Mary gestured with her mug. \u201cMalia?\u201d\n \u201cPsychology? Well, it\u2019s about what you\u2019d expect.\u201d Malia picked up a gravure on which she\u2019d made pink highlights. \u201cHere\u2019s Miranda Watson, as profiled by the experts. IQ of eighty-seven, tested at eight years old. Strong inclinations toward introversion and intuitive thinking.\u201d Malia scanned with a finger. \u201cShe rejected the customs of modern life. Became rabidly anti-industry. We see frequent attempts to run away from home. As a kid, she had a fascination with so-called feral children. As a teen, she joined the Anti-Learning movement. You know, \u2018education is indoctrination,\u2019 all that stuff. Her favorite game is BC-Simple. Her favorite book is Ishmael, by Daniel Quinn.\u201d\n \u201cSo a hippie, basically,\u201d Ken said. \u201cOne hundred years too late.\u201d\n \u201cYes, but why.\u201d Mary drew a circle with her mug over the table. \u201cWhy all this fascination with primitivism?\u201d\n Malia\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cPrimitivism. That\u2019s kind of a loaded word, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n Here we go. Mary pursed her lips. \u201cThe trouble is, there\u2019s no word for this kind of thing that isn\u2019t loaded. This girl chose to become something . . . something different, something other, something less than human. We need to know why.\u201d\n The subsequent silence told Mary she\u2019d misstepped. Malia was pouting at her gravure. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely comfortable with those words. Less than.\u201d\n \u201cEvery animal is different,\u201d Paul said.\n \u201cThese aren\u2019t animals.\u201d Ken, at the far end of the table, went rigid as wood. \u201cThese are human beings\u2014silly, entitled human beings\u2014who made a choice\u2014\u201d\n Mary held up a hand. Another minute of this, and they\u2019d spend another three hours arguing.\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for the physiology. Paul?\u201d\n Paul, not a fan of gravures, set his tablet on his knees. \u201cWell, it\u2019s typical stuff. At nineteen, Miranda Watson joined the Neo-Paleos. That name\u2019s a bit of a joke. It\u2019s an international group. A few hundred thousand people, headquartered in Denver\u2014\u201d\n Mary milled her hand while sipping coffee. \u201cI know who they are.\u201d\n \u201cOK. So you know they pool their donations. Only certain members qualify for the treatments. Watson got approved at twenty-two. She was flown to Malaysia to undergo\u2014again, hate this word\u2014her devolution.\u201d\n \u201cDo we know who did it? Doctor? Clinic? Company?\u201d\n Paul shook his head. Mary had expected that. Devolution was illegal worldwide. But some governments turned a blind eye, didn\u2019t keep records. Looking to balance good business with international approval.\n \u201cIt could have happened in Malaysia,\u201d said Paul. \u201cIt could have happened in Thailand. It could have happened in Vietnam. Once you go to the Tiger states, all bets are off.\u201d\n Mary nodded, disappointed but not surprised. Her work at the Bioethics Agency mostly focused on Americans flying east for surgery. Thousands of botched cosmetic cases came flooding back from South Asia every year. The Indian Ocean suffered from a scourge of black-market butchers. Tasked with untangling indemnities, the Executive Bioethics Agency had ballooned to rival the NIH.\n \u201cWhat we can do,\u201d Paul said, \u201cis reconstruct the process.\u201d He pulled out an image of a sasquatch, an anatomical diagram. \u201cSo far, seventeen people have gotten this so-called Bigfoot treatment. Voluntary devolution. All Americans. There are three phases.\u201d\n Paul tapped his shoulder. \u201cFirst, musculoskeletal. Stature is increased. That\u2019s done with bone implants. The muscles are built up with stimulated growth\u2014electric, hormonal. They have a microsurgery unit go in and strengthen the anchorage points, ligaments, attachments. Hips and feet get altered, to create what\u2019s called a compliant gait. And so on.\u201d\n Paul flicked at the image, accessing a second layer of the file. This showed an internal view, guts and bones.\n \u201cSecond, visceral. Digestive tract has to be tweaked, to handle the rough diet. The heart gets a boost from a modulator\u2014like a pacemaker, but smarter. That\u2019s standard treatment for athletes, too. Then skin. It\u2019s not difficult to stimulate this condition, hirsuteness. You know: the hairiness. It amounts to a simple genetic treatment.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not the issue,\u201d Mary said.\n \u201cThe issue . . . \u201d Paul put all ten fingers to his scalp, as if to pluck his brain from his skull and set it aside. \u201cThe issue is this. The brain. What do you do about the brain? If you want to be a sasquatch, you have to think like a sasquatch. You have to live like one.\u201d\n The others nodded, mulling over the implications.\n Paul put aside his tablet. \u201cSo. The science here gets a little hairy\u2014er, so to speak. There are a lot of different ways to alter the mind, as anyone who takes antidepressants can tell you. But most of these treatments use the same technique. Engineered bacteria.\u201d He tapped his scalp. \u201cInject them into the cerebral tissue. A few key segments are targeted. Wernicke\u2019s area, Broca\u2019s area, regions of the prefrontal cortex. Transcranial pulses guide the bacteria along pathways mapped in advance. They eat the synaptic connections. Almost literally, they rot the brain. That\u2019s a rough description, of course, but you get the idea. When the damage is done, antibiotics eliminate the infection. NGF treatments build up compensatory areas\u2014olfactory, sensorimotor, lower-order functions. To a limited extent\u2014a very limited extent\u2014you can mold the brain, eliminating advanced faculties in favor of\u2014here\u2019s another silly word\u2014instincts. No more speech. No more abstract reasoning.\u201d\n \u201cSelf-mutilation,\u201d Ken said.\n Malia drummed pink nails on the table. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of beautiful, actually.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re not here to debate aesthetics,\u201d Mary said.\n \u201cHow can you not admire them, though. Just a little bit?\u201d Malia\u2019s eyes grew dreamy. \u201cThe bravery to do that, to change your mind, to purify your soul? It\u2019s heroic, in a way.\u201d\n \u201cThese are kids,\u201d Ken frowned. \u201cKids who made a terrible mistake. Who have done a terrible thing to themselves. Who, even before they did that thing, had obvious mental problems.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s not hard to understand.\u201d Malia\u2019s eyes, under her hair extensions, lifted to one of the tent\u2019s small windows. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t dreamed of being . . . well . . . innocent again?\u201d\n Ken\u2019s fingers twitched. Tendons stood out in his wrists. \u201cThey decided to inflict brain damage on themselves. That\u2019s not innocent. That\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it brain damage.\u201d Malia stared into the forest, where the light had faded from green to blue. \u201cIt\u2019s not a handicap, really. They\u2019re out there, living in the wild. Surviving. How many ordinary people can do that?\u201d\n Ken\u2019s neck pulsed. He looks like a wildman himself, Mary thought. A beast on the verge of losing control.\n \u201cThe reason these . . . these things are surviving out here,\u201d Ken pressed with his fists until the table bent, \u201cis because we protect them. We set aside the park. There used to be grizzlies in these mountains. No more. Now, instead of bears, we have these so-called sasquatches, living in the same ecological niche. They\u2019re not a wild population. They\u2019re kept alive by\u2014\u201d Emotion choked him. \u201cBy legal fictions, popular delusions, federal regulations. It\u2019s not even a breeding population.\u201d\n Mary coughed into her hand. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\n Malia stood, eyes on the window. She pushed back her chair, went around the table, rose onto her toes, and looked out at the forest, lifting a finger to the mosquito netting.\n Mary was perturbed by the young woman\u2019s manner. \u201cMalia?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to call it self-mutilation.\u201d Malia ignored Mary\u2019s question, speaking softly as she stared into the woods. Her long extensions whispered like rain on her nylon shirt. \u201cThere\u2019s no higher or lower in nature. Only tradeoffs. Right, Paul? Back me up.\u201d\n Paul, sitting with his back to her, wrinkled his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t like these big-picture debates. I prefer to talk specifics.\u201d\n \u201cMalia,\u201d Mary sighed, \u201cwill you sit down, please?\u201d\n Malia lingered at the window, stroking the screen. \u201cI keep thinking I see them. Walking through the trees.\u201d Her eyes hovered over the dripping filigrees of the forest. \u201cYou can worry about specifics, Paul. You\u2019re the biologist. I have to think big picture. Mary and I both do. When we go back and make our report, we\u2019re going to face thousands of questions, probably a meeting with the president, maybe a Congressional hearing. And when news gets out, we\u2019re going to have several billion people weighing in on what we decide.\u201d\n Don\u2019t I know it. Mary stretched over the table, reaching for Paul\u2019s anatomical image. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to know exactly what we\u2019re doing. Paul, thanks, but . . . when it comes to this devolution process, I was under the impression that a standard part . . . \u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Paul cut her short. \u201cI was getting to that. I know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d He tapped his anatomical image, jabbing the diagram\u2019s belly. \u201cSterilization is the final step. Chemical castration. A hysterectomy. Maybe ovarian and testicular replacements.\u201d His nose twitched. \u201cThis is done for obvious reasons.\u201d\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s done for males and females, right?\u201d\n \u201cCorrect.\u201d\n \u201cSo what\u2019s going on?\u201d Mary held up her hands. \u201cThese are easy procedures. Compared to cerebral modification, sterilization is absolutely trivial. One fertile sasquatch might be an oversight. But two? Out of a population of seventeen? One male, one female? This has to be deliberate. An agenda. And agendas leave traces.\u201d She slid the printouts around with her palms. \u201cWe know who the mother is. I think we can make a good guess about the father.\u201d\n \u201cYuh-up.\u201d Paul bent to his tablet. \u201cThat male we saw, on the trail. Most likely subject.\u201d\n \u201cAnd with two subjects . . . \u201d Mary frowned, finger curled under her mouth, thinking. \u201cMalia, get in touch with Archives again. Have them do a report on that male. Bio, psych, everything they have. I\u2019m willing to bet, if we compare these two case studies, we\u2019ll turn up something that\u2014\u201d\n A crack made them all look up. Ken was on his feet, hunched, fists jammed into the table. The plastic had split under the pressure of his hands.\n \u201cKen, what the hell?\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you doing, Mary?\u201d The ranger\u2019s voice was low. His neck had swelled like a wrestler\u2019s. The carotid arteries throbbed against his collar. \u201cI mean, really, what the hell are you doing here?\u201d\n Mary ran her eyes down the buttons of Ken\u2019s shirt. How would an animal perceive him, she wondered, this big male creature, puffed up with rage? How would the sasquatches see him, with their modified brains, their surgically adjusted senses? Would they be alarmed? Intrigued? Afraid?\n \u201cMalia. Paul.\u201d Mary snapped her fingers, pointing at the gadgets that littered the table. \u201cGet in touch with Archives, track down that male. Ken?\u201d She snapped again, pointing at the tent flap. \u201cOutside.\u201d\n In the evening, the rain had dwindled to a latent freshness in the air. The sky above the mountains was murky blue, thick as a cerulean liqueur. But night had already filled the black hollows between the trees.\n Mary touched the automatic zipper. With a robotic whirr, the tent\u2019s square door sealed them out in the chill.\n \u201cKen, if there\u2019s something you want to say to me\u2014\u201d\n He was already talking. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with, Mary.\u201d\n \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n \u201cLook, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fun to play detective.\u201d Ken paced the dry clearing under the overhang, a restless animal hemmed in by dripping water. \u201cI know it\u2019s great fun for you D.C. types to come out here and strut and pose. Very exciting. Very Hollywood. But we all know where this has to end up.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure I do, Ken. That\u2019s why we need to discuss it.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s only one way this can end.\u201d\n Mary sipped from her travel mug, realized it was empty, and searched for a place to set it down. Finding no free surfaces, she dangled it at her side. Ken held out his palms.\n \u201cWhy did you even come here?\u201d\n \u201cYou know why.\u201d Mary sighed. \u201cWe received a report\u2014several reports, actually, from local hikers. There were multiple sightings. We opened a file\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd? We could have confirmed the sighting for you. The rangers. We could have done what had to be done. All this could have been over by now, neat and clean. Without this\u2014this\u2014\u201d His fists shook. \u201cThis rigmarole.\u201d\n Mary dropped her voice. \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, Ken. You know it. These are tricky issues. The ethics agency\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTricky issues? You\u2019ve confirmed your sighting. And you\u2019re still here, wasting my time. Still looking for ways to cover your ass.\u201d\n Mary longed for a place to sit. She wished she could have this conversation in an office, an environment to lend her a little authority. Not out here, bickering, in the woods, like teenagers squabbling on a bad camping trip.\n \u201cThere\u2019s more to a site visit, more to a confirmation of a sighting, than a few minutes of film, Ken. When I file my report\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTo hell with your report!\u201d Ken\u2019s finger indicated the tent. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing that matters here. You insisted on protecting these creatures. Your people, your agency. You set up this preserve. You wanted to pander to the delusions of the American public. Oh, poor sasquatches, what charming creatures. And now you\u2019re paying the price.\u201d He pointed at Mary\u2019s hip, where the recorder still hung clipped to her belt. \u201cWhen that film gets out . . . you\u2019ll see. You know where this is heading. There\u2019s only one morally responsible action you can take. And you\u2019re dreading it.\u201d\n Mary hated to play bureaucrat. But she knew there was a definite power in the schoolmarmish air with which she drew back her shoulders, stiffened her spine, pursed her lips, like a strict teacher. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate situation, I agree. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking this slowly. That\u2019s why I want your input. Every comma I put in my report, every comment I make to my director, every bit of information we can uncover\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBullshit.\u201d Ken turned away, swatting at the triangular tips of ferns that extended into the lamplight. \u201cYou know the truth. There\u2019s no way, no way on Earth, those things can be allowed to give birth to a human child.\u201d\n Mary settled back against the wall of the tent, almost resting her weight on the flimsy plastic, so tired, so eager to be done with this assignment, that she came quite near to giving in.\n Because Ken was right. Dreadfully right. Wasn\u2019t he? The Bigfoot treatment, as it was commonly called, affected only the subject who received it. It was a skin-deep, muscle-deep, bone-deep, brain-deep treatment.\n But it was not germ-line deep.\n The treatment consisted of dozens of procedures. But none of those procedures affected a patient\u2019s gametes. None touched the egg cells or sperm cells. Only a few affected a patient\u2019s DNA.\n Meaning any child born to such a creature . . .\n The cruelty of it hit Mary like slap. Her cheeks warmed, her skin tingled. Nature could be so ruthless, so indifferent. And the same was true, in many ways, of modern science.\n From the body of that towering beast would emerge, in mere weeks, a naked infant, a human child. It would have a human body, human bones, human organs. It would shiver with a human\u2019s hairless skin.\n It would have a human\u2019s needs: for society, companionship, nurture, care, nutrition.\n And it would have a sasquatch for a mother.\n What would that mother try to do? Suckle the infant? Feed it leaves?\n Smack its brains out? Crush it by mistake? Leave it under a tree to die?\n Or worse?\n Mary shivered with a childish frustration. It wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t ethical to steal away a mother\u2019s child. Yet how cruel, how careless it would be to leave a naked infant to suffer and starve in the woods.\n Either way, it would amount to an infringement of human rights.\n But were they human, the sasquatches? They had been human, once. They had now chosen to be otherwise. Weren\u2019t their former, human selves responsible for the consequences of that choice? And as for their current forms\u2014were they animals, really? Were they subject to the treatment that animals receive? Or were they something other, something unclassifiable, something in-between? And if so, would that make it easier, what Mary had to do? Or harder?\n Had she been ignoring the obvious? Had all this discussion, this argument, this investigation, been nothing but a way to put off a cruel choice?\n \u201cThey brought this on themselves, Mary.\u201d Ken spoke quietly, looking into the forest. \u201cThe kids who got the treatment. This is their fault. Not ours.\u201d\n Mary stared into the deepening shadows where only a few sparkling raindrops caught the light. The afternoon\u2019s downpour, sifting from the canopy, masked all movement and muffled all sound. Almost anything might be hiding out there, crouched in the bushes just outside their lamp. A bear, a wolverine, five meters away. With her human senses, dulled and abused by urban environments, Mary would never know.\n \u201cYou know what frustrates me?\u201d Ken spoke into his collar. \u201cThe shifting standards. These people decided to rot their brains. They claimed it was their human right. Self-determination. Ownership of their bodies. Now that they\u2019ve done it, the rest of society insists on granting them animal rights. You say they\u2019re a protected species, rare, vulnerable, unique. You give them a nice forest to live in, plenty of berries to eat, a whole lot of prime real estate all to themselves. But it can\u2019t work both ways, can it?\u201d\n His face, when he turned, was full of childish frustration, a boyish insistence on having clear answers.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t be both innocent and responsible.\u201d\n Mary didn\u2019t answer. Her mind was on the forest, the steady patter and shiver of the trees, the haunting noises that floated from the hills. It was like something out of folklore, the quivering secrecy of this place. A branch snapped like a tiny firecracker, and Mary\u2019s brain filled with primitive fear. She trembled to visions of monsters, wild predators, stealthy shapes emerging from the shadows . . .\n Ken ignored the sound. \u201cI said before that I\u2019m not a nature buff. That\u2019s not entirely true. I used to love nature. I used to love gorillas. I thought we\u2019d be able to keep them alive. I used to love mammoths, Tasmanian tigers. I thought we\u2019d be able to bring them back to life. I used to love abominable snowmen. Yes, and Bigfoot. I used to believe such things existed.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI thought there was more out here than banana slugs and garden spiders. But we grow up, don\u2019t we? We all have to grow up.\u201d\n \u201cMary?\u201d\n They both gasped at once. Paul\u2019s head was sticking through the tent flap. The robotic zipper, sealed to his throat, gave him the appearance of a grotesque mounted trophy. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a profile on that male you wanted.\u201d\n \u201cThanks, Paul.\u201d\n \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know, we already compared the two bios. The male\u2019s name is Andrew Jones. Turns out he devolved five years before Watson. A different era, in biotech time.\u201d\n Mary was still trying to shake it off, the sense of responsibility that clung to her like mud. She backed toward the edge of the clearing, forcing herself to concentrate. \u201cWere you able to pin down the clinic?\u201d\n \u201cAha. Right. That\u2019s the thing.\u201d Paul squinted, adjusting his glasses by crinkling his nose. \u201cSee, it wasn\u2019t a clinic. Malia\u2019s been looking at the group\u2019s financials. There\u2019s a pattern. It works like this: they save up money for a year or so, then pay for a member to get the treatment. After each treatment, they do a big funding drive. And here\u2019s the interesting part. After these two particular treatments, the ones for Watson and Jones\u2014after these, the organization did huge funding drives. Massive. Really milking their supporters. Malia thinks they must have spent nine, ten times as much as usual. There\u2019s only one nation that can suck that kind of money into secret biotech. China. And there\u2019s only one service\u2014\u201d\n It was like a ghost story, suddenly coming true. It was like a Native American myth.\n Mary had been backing away across the clearing, putting space between herself and Paul\u2019s face. She stepped, now, from beneath the tent\u2019s overhang, out into the chilly trickle of the rain. Water pricked her scalp. Wet ferns slid against her hand.\n And, quite suddenly, Mary sensed it behind her, a heaviness, a presence, like a condensation of the forest into flesh.\n No hairy hand fell on Mary\u2019s shoulder. No feral fangs sank into her neck. But she might have been approached by a predator, so swift was her reaction.\n Mary spun, throwing up her hands. And choked back what could easily have been a humiliating scream.\n The face looking down at her, lit to savage effect by the lamplight, was dark and hollow-cheeked, thickly whiskered, fringed in long, wispy hair that resembled the silky mane of an Afghan hound. Thin lips parted over large square teeth. The eyes, chocolate-dark, held two glaring reflections of the white lamp behind Mary\u2019s head.\n It was the male. And as Mary turned to face him, he dipped his head in a bow. She may have been mistaken, she may have been overwhelmed. But it seemed to Mary there was real human dignity in the gesture\u2014human poise, as well as animal grace.\n The male stepped aside. With a swing of his arm, a tilt of his shoulders, he introduced another sasquatch: the female, his mate. Miranda Watson, or the being that had been Miranda Watson, stepped into the clearing. Mary saw the shine of sweat on her skin. Her incisors glinted in a grimace of strain. The symptoms were unmistakable. Hands curled under her belly, fingers knitted in tawny fur.\n \u201cKen.\u201d Mary stumbled backward, embarrassed to find herself succumbing to a primitive instinct, retreating to the side of the nearest human male. Looking up, she was surprised to see the park ranger calm, even resigned, his mouth relaxed into a frown of acceptance. It was as if he\u2019d known these creatures were here all along, nearby, waiting for the right moment to approach.\n \u201cWhoa.\u201d Paul blinked. Bowing under the tent\u2019s overhang, the sasquatches exhibited all the grandeur of their surgically modified muscles, their enhanced bones. Early news reports had mocked them as \u201cliving gorilla suits,\u201d \u201creal-life Chewbaccas,\u201d and various other glib conceits. Mary saw, now, how unfair those stereotypes were. The sasquatches put to shame every shaggy Halloween costume. They exposed the falseness of the classic hoaxes\u2014the famous Patterson film of the sixties, the later CGI stunts. They moved with the adroitness of unselfconscious creatures.\n \u201cI had no idea.\u201d Paul\u2019s head, still thrust through the tent flap, bobbed boyishly as he took the creatures in. \u201cEven this morning, I didn\u2019t really . . . It\u2019s hard to believe, isn\u2019t it? It really is hard to believe.\u201d\n But the sasquatches, standing before them, smelling of the forest, were entirely credible and defiantly real. The only thing that strained belief was the thought that they had once been human.\n \u201cWhat do you think they want?\u201d Paul squinted. Looking into his creased face, Mary almost laughed. A smart kid, yes, but so very young.\n \u201cI think that\u2019s obvious, Paul.\u201d With a confidence and composure that made Mary marvel, Ken stepped past her and unzipped the tent.\n While Ken held up the flap, the sasquatches shambled in like obedient dogs. Every movement they made was its own uncanny event. They gestured like humans, but carried their shoulders like apes; they rocked and swayed and bent their knees. As someone with a background in biology, Mary had always scorned talk of \u201cmissing links,\u201d knowing evolution to be more incremental than epochal. These animals embodied such outmoded assumptions. They met Mary\u2019s eyes with the frankness of children. They perched between conceptual categories: half-human, half-intelligent, half-innocent, half-wild.\n \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time, here.\u201d Ken collapsed the table, folding the legs under the plastic top. From his pack he unclipped a thin sleeping bag.\n The female was already into the late stage of labor. Her attention turned inward. Her breaths came in puffs. Hunched over and cramped by her intensifying contractions, she let the male guide her down to the unrolled sleeping bag. Mary had ceased to think now of these beings as Miranda Watson and Andrew Jones. But she believed she saw a lingering humanity, shaped by habit and history and time, in their smallest gestures\u2014especially in their consideration for each other, the way they attended to mutual needs. Who knew what memories\u2014of suburban driveways, of franchise restaurants, of screen doors and swingsets and summer-lawn sprinklers\u2014were stored up in those shaggy heads?\n Memories of doctors. Memories of trust. Memories of medical men and women.\n The male pawed gently at Mary\u2019s hand. His fingers were unnervingly human, the nails brown and bitten short.\n Mary rocked on her heels. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been a long time since I did this. Frankly, it\u2019s been years.\u201d\n The female shrieked. Mary winced. This was a feral creature, with modified, inhuman hips; what chance did it have of birthing a human child? Yet, kneeling on the tent floor, Mary saw that the time for such doubts had passed. A dark shape bulged amid the brown fur. The baby\u2019s head was already emerging.\n From here, Mary knew, routine would be her guide. She wiped at the condensation clinging to her brow. Habits from her years in Baltimore came back, the sweaty, profoundly absorbing, athletic skill of midwifery. Mary\u2019s hands knew where to press, what to hold, when to yield. She saw at one point that she\u2019d unconsciously rolled up her sleeves, unbuttoned her collar, tied back her hair; even these minor preparations were hardwired by years of busy labor. Rags and fire, knife and water: necessary tools found their way to her hands, offered by Ken and Malia and Paul\u2014even by the male sasquatch, who had discovered, of all things, a quart of whiskey in Ken\u2019s luggage. Mary smiled at the deftness of the creature\u2019s dark hands, the care with which he cradled the bottle. Old habits, she supposed, old addictions, and old memories die hard.\n She washed her hands in bottled springwater, cleansed and sterilized the knife. She covered the ground with towels. In the end, after all her instinctive preparations, Mary found that she had little to do. With the pleasure of deeply remembered experience, she relived the euphoria of her residency years, the exhaustion and invigoration that blur into a trance of expertise, the giddy, driven seasons of her youth when she had watched her fingers stitch incisions, palpate abdomens, lift wriggling infants through Caesarean slits. The joy of work, of using her body, of instinctual response, of service and care. Pausing to wipe her face, she noticed with a kind of distant surprise the bureaucratic detritus of their daylong meeting\u2014the tablets, the gravures, the printers and recorders\u2014piled haphazardly in the corners of the tent, like garbage from a party that had never been thrown.\n Their deliberations, their differences, were now thrust aside. They worked, together, with cloth and steel, with water and flesh, with hands and tools. A spray of blood spilled into the towels. Mary\u2019s hands were steady. Her nerves leapt to the task with quickfire readiness. The best of life is habit, she thought, watching herself, her expert movements, with a detached and speculative pleasure. The best of us is instinct, unselfconscious\u2014and the wet furry body came squirming into her hands.\n Furry?\n Paul and Ken crowded forward. The men stooped, rapt with a queasy curiosity. The women settled back into fatigued relief. Mary knelt on one knee, massaging the last blood through the pale, blue-veined umbilical cord. The male sasquatch stretched out a finger, tentative as a toddler. Mary shared his surprise.\n \u201cKen, do you have that knife?\u201d\n With the cord cut and knotted, Mary hunted for unsullied towels. Only when the little bundle of fussing limbs and hungry lips had been laid on the mother\u2019s breast did the surprise of the birth settle in.\n Furry. Yes, furry!\n Mary pulled aside the towel. They would have to run tests. They would verify the conclusion with exams and assays. But eyes and skin, fingers and palms, the breath in her chest and the pulse in her throat, all insisted on one evident truth.\n \u201cPaul?\u201d She looked up, helpless and wondering. The young biologist was smiling. This is it, Mary thought, even as she felt her cheeks tighten in an answering smile\u2014this is what we live for, doctors and scientists, midwifes and naturalists\u2014the vertigo, the shock of facing something indescribably ancient, yet dizzyingly new.\n \u201cThis is what I was trying to tell you, Mary!\u201d Paul blinked furiously, crinkling his nose. \u201cHow we found the male. The expenditures. The Chinese.\u201d\n \u201cSlow down, Paul.\u201d She laughed, enjoying his boyish excitement.\n \u201cBut listen. This is what we realized. There\u2019s only one kind of treatment that can absorb a big outlay like that. And there\u2019s only one country where you can get it done. Of course it\u2019s still illegal. But we know who the groups are, we know what they\u2019ve been doing. Who would have thought? It started with state research. A national eugenics program.\u201d\n Eugenics. Mary sniffed. Dysgenics. Advance, decline, progression, regression. Such terms all seemed beyond silly, in this hot tent, with the strain of birth still heavy in the air, a furry prodigy wriggling in her hands. Improvement, alteration, death, life, birth\u2014and yet it was all just evolution, in the end.\n She touched the curl of the chimplike ear, the snuffling, almost ursine snout. Years ago, hearing about these humans who became sasquatches, Mary had taken a wry delight in the irony. Wonders of science, fruits of rationalism, eons of reason and progress and technology, and this, this was what people chose to do. Now the early wonder came back as a flush in her throat\u2014as she considered the steady groping of life toward ever-growing variety.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a germ line change,\u201d Paul babbled. \u201cThey got their gametes modified. Phenotype in one generation, genotype in the next. No wonder it cost them so much to have it done. Imagine the effort.\u201d\n Mary couldn\u2019t imagine it. A human being amounts to more than four billion years of accumulated mutations. And this little creature, she believed, bright-eyed and bawling, represented more than however many black-market dollars lay behind its creation. Mary cupped a hand around the infant\u2019s head, guiding its searching lips to the nipple. What did one call a baby sasquatch? Infant? The immediacy of the question made her tremble.\n \u201cThis is going to be hell to explain to the public,\u201d Malia said.\n Mary laughed. Yes, drafting her report would be difficult. And the infant, poor thing, would get a battery of tests. Her excitement faltered at thoughts of bureaucratic battles, Congressional inquiries, tabloid scandals, and public outcry ahead. People still hadn\u2019t gotten used to genetic engineering. Now, humanity\u2019s oldest notions would be overturned again.\n The father sasquatch squatted on the earth. Mary started as a hand dropped to her shoulder. She looked up to see Ken\u2019s downturned face. His expression was solemn. He leaned over, reaching out to touch the infant\u2019s cheek, drawing its bulbous, dark eyes to his face.\n \u201cI guess this\u2019ll be a big hassle for you,\u201d Mary said to him. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a new species to look after, now, Ken. A genuine new species. Assuming, of course, Paul\u2019s explanation is correct.\u201d\n Ken nodded. He\u2019d have plenty of work ahead of him, Mary knew. New patrols, drone cameras, new onerous regulations. New battles to be fought over turf and official territory. The work of guarding the wilderness had always been thankless, but noble. Now here was a new wilderness, a new frontier, contained within one tiny, furry head.\n Assuming Ken didn\u2019t find all this monstrous. Assuming he was willing to accept the burden.\n Burden, Mary thought. But that\u2019s what life is. Always a burden, a heavy endowment, passing from bearer to bearer, breast to breast.\n \u201cStreams and mountains,\u201d she muttered, touching Ken\u2019s hand.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that Mary?\u201d He knelt at her side, pushing aside the towel. They bent forward, together, marveling at the small perplexed eyes, the pink mouth, the details of the two tiny, kicking feet.\n \u201cGary Snyder. The poet I was telling you about. I was just remembering something he wrote.\u201d\n And Mary quoted for them all, as the young cries went out, echoing through the dripping trees\u2014\n Walking on walking,\n under foot earth turns.\n Streams and mountains never stay the same."}

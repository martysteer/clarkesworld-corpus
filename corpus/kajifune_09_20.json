The digital textbook remains open on my tablet, still showing today\u2019s lesson.\n An infinite number of ants crawl up my hands on the desk\u2014or so I feel. When I blink a few times, they\u2019re gone without a trace.\n The class is thrown into chaos. Some girls get up and scream. Terrified cries fill the room.\n The teacher, a young man in his twenties, writhes about on the floor, screaming in agony.\n An explosion thunders afar, followed by a booming roar.\n \u201cRumi, come with me!\u201d\n I turn in the direction of the voice. It\u2019s Miina. She grabs my arm and pulls me hard.\n I follow her as she drags me along.\n As I feel her grip on my arm, we dash through the long hallway in the midst of utter confusion. We run up the stairs everyone stays away from.\n \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\n \u201cA safe place,\u201d Miina answers. \u201cAway from everybody else.\u201d\n Monitors are everywhere at our school, keeping tabs on us in the name of security.\n Miina leads me toward the rooftop. When she hurls herself against the entrance door, it opens without much resistance.\n We catch our breath in a shower of early-summer sunlight. A clean, monotonous townscape spreads in all directions.\n \u201cThat\u2019s the only way in.\u201d She points her chin toward the door. \u201cAnd out.\u201d\n A flame rises in the downtown area. I cower, startled.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Miina asks.\n \u201cAn explosion . . . \u201d\n \u201cIs that so? It\u2019s all illusion\u2014triggered by the nanobots.\u201d\n Miina has a special ability.\n She can read physical books.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got something to show you.\u201d Miina handed me a book in her dorm room. \u201cOpen it,\u201d she added.\n As I flipped through the book, rubbing the print-filled pages with my fingers, the letters danced before my eyes.\n For a while, I followed the sentences with my eyes, but I eventually got lost in them. I had never read a printed book before. My head throbbed lightly.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t read, can you?\u201d she said, as if surprised.\n I shot her a resentful glance.\n \u201cI can,\u201d she said and described what the book contained.\n \u201cThe human brain feels threatened when another person suffers less or gains something. That characteristic has survived to this day because it has aided the survival of humanity. In other words, when necessities were scarce, when food and shelter were limited, humans had to take it from someone else in order to get something.\u201d\n \u201cSounds a lot like the definition of the word \u2018jealousy,\u2019\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, Rumi.\u201d\n I first saw Miina among the incoming freshmen who lined up in front of the immaculate first aid room where we regularly have learning nanobots administered. As I impatiently waited for my turn, the sound of cheerful laughter reached my ears. As I looked up, a short-haired tomboy caught my eye. She was the center of attention, chatting with other girls. She struck me as my exact opposite.\n Then she stepped closer and talked to me.\n We began with exchanging names, but the rest is all a blur to me now, except for one thing that I wondered\u2014What does someone like her want from me?\n That\u2019s how I met Miina.\n Before long, I began spending lots of time in Miina\u2019s dorm room.\n \u201cI don\u2019t remember my mother\u2019s face,\u201d I confided in her one day.\n She listened to me attentively while she lay in her bed. When I was done, she rolled over, pulled up her sleeve, and showed me the inner part of her arm.\n \u201cLook,\u201d she said, pointing to several severe bruises. \u201cThey\u2019ve tried to harvest my bone marrow cells.\u201d\n I gasped.\n \u201cI\u2019m immune to the nanobots. They want to transfer this immunity to others. The military.\u201d\n \u201cThe military?\u201d\n \u201cThe psychological forces,\u201d she lowered her voice. \u201cJust don\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d\n By this time, we had grown close to each other and shared each other\u2019s secrets.\n \u201cI\u2019m different. I can read physical books. But because I\u2019m different, the military practically owns me.\u201d\n Although I neglected to tell Miina, my father serves as an officer in the psychological forces. When I went home for the winter holidays, I brought up some questions.\n \u201cDo the nanobots ever fail to affect some people?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cJust between us,\u201d he began, with a half-empty glass of whisky in his hand, relaxing on the couch in the living room. \u201cSome of us aren\u2019t affected by the nanobots. They\u2019ve got a special immune system that expels the nanobots when they enter their bodies. What do you think they\u2019re good for?\u201d\n \u201cThe military.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right. We now employ the nanobots as a means of psychological warfare. We scatter them in the air to cause mental disorders in our targets. Anyone who\u2019s immune to the nanobots can be an excellent candidate for a soldier or an agent.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got a classmate who can read books. She\u2019s immune to the nanobots given to us at school.\u201d\n \u201cA certain percentage of the population possesses that disposition. We keep a huge list of them.\u201d\n I gathered that he knew about Miina as he averted his gaze.\n \u201cWhy do you not want us to read books?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cHalf-baked imagination will breed hatred,\u201d my father gulped his drink. \u201cThere was a time when information wasn\u2019t controlled,\u201d he continued, as if talking to someone afar. \u201cAbundant information existed, more than humanity could process. Back then, humans\u2019 ability to supplement reality with their imagination backfired. Imagination was at fault. That\u2019s why we take away kids\u2019 ability to imagine.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with our ability to read books?\u201d\n \u201cInformation deemed harmful has been expunged from digital publications, but it may still remain in physical books. If you kids come across the harmful information, you won\u2019t understand it. Above all, we need to protect kids from fiction so that they won\u2019t develop imaginations. After you\u2019re administered the nanobots in school for a few years, your imagination will be diminished for the rest of your life. You\u2019ll need training to understand fiction. Without that training, you won\u2019t be able to develop your imagination.\u201d\n The learning nanobots we receive in school are designed to enhance memory as they stimulate the synapses to unite one another. In addition, they affect the prefrontal cortex in our brain and weaken our imagination. They also utilize how our brain reacts to transmitted light and reflected light differently to reduce our ability to understand texts written on paper.\n Besides what my father told me, this is pretty much what my online search has yielded. Even so, information is hard to come by due to blunt censorship. My quest for knowledge has repeatedly run aground, as I\u2019ve never been granted full access to the archives.\n \u201cI feel lonely sometimes,\u201d Miina mumbles. We\u2019re alone up here on the rooftop. The whole city is drowned in a sea of illusion the nanobots have unleashed.\n \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll be alone, away from everyone,\u201d she continues. \u201cBut I want someone to remember me and think of me once in a while.\u201d\n \u201cDid you get what I asked?\u201d I change the subject. Miina looks surprised for a moment, but she takes a silver-colored cylinder out of her pocket and hands it to me.\n \u201cI\u2019ll remember you for the rest of my life, Miina,\u201d I say and stick the tip of the cylinder into the inner part of my arm, taking aim at the vein.\n \u201cAre you sure about that, Rumi?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re asking me now?\u201d\n We burst into laughter. Now Miina\u2019s hemopoietic cells roam through my body. One prick of a painless needle does the trick. Thanks to the latest technology, no transplant rejection occurs.\n \u201cDo you think you can pilfer your bone marrow cells for me?\u201d I asked her about a month ago.\n An enormous dog walks along the street in the distance while it drools. Another bomb explodes in close vicinity. Unaffected by the nanobots, Miina sees or hears none of this while the whole city is under siege. My father said he had been busy at work. The military must have upped the ante.\n Miina can imagine and read books.\n I want to feel what she feels every day."}

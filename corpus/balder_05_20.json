Maybe a bit shabbier, a bit more crowded.\n The coldsleep hangover crashed down on her like a barrel of fish and she changed her plans into sleep first, right now. She headed for the rack of sleep drawers outside the port offices\u2014colloquially known as coffins\u2014and was about to crawl in when The Briny Everything caught her eye.\n The restaurant was still there. She\u2019d eaten her final meal in-system there, before she\u2019d embarked on her great adventure. Going to study at the last university on Chong Kong Long. Or running away from home and responsibilities, as her parents had called it. Suddenly food seemed even more important than sleep.\n She shoved her luggage into the coffin, ordered her medical app to dispense a pick-me-up, and headed for The Briny Everything. Living on a distant wormhole hub meant she hadn\u2019t tasted real fish for eleven years. Her home planet of Knossos exported thousands of tons of the most famous delicacy in the universe, but lightyears of distance made it too expensive even for a fairly successful journalist like Havi.\n But here, it was only a short hop to the planet\u2019s surface, and she could eat the real thing before facing her family. What could be more important than a fish meal?\n The Briny Everything was the real deal. If you asked them for fish from the Clan Morotai channel, they wouldn\u2019t serve you the ones from Clan Antjie a few kilometers away. They knew their stuff, and they respected customers who did as well.\n Havi was from Clan Skuja, and that was what she was hoping to eat tonight. The taste of home, without actually having to face her family. Of course Havi hadn\u2019t traversed half of known space to not visit her home planet. Of course she missed it and her old friends. But with every wormhole hop the likelihood diminished of the reunion going well. She\u2019d run off from her family, her planned career in fish care, everything she\u2019d ever known, eleven years ago. Why would anyone be glad to see her? Damn that therapist. She should have just written a debriefing letter and left it at that.\n She scanned the menu. The Briny had a great selection, and thankfully Skuja fish were on it. She ordered a full Skuja sashimi spread and a local beer. Time to sit back with her hands behind her head and grab a few minutes of doing absolutely nothing while her fish was prepared.\n Her platter looked fantastic when it arrived, satiny orange flesh with rainbow glimmers over it, the skin separately roasted and spread around the kernel of flesh like a flower. She looked closer. How had they disguised the cuts where the ring of eyes around the middle had been removed? New technique maybe.\n She picked up a morsel with her chopsticks and settled it on her tongue, waiting for it to melt and burst into flavor.\n It was more of a whimper than a bang.\n Hm. Maybe not enough garum? She dipped the second piece into more sauce, and tried again. No.\n No way.\n This wasn\u2019t Skuja terroir, nor was it any of the fifty-four terroirs whose taste her parents had drilled into her in endless lessons. Even though she\u2019d made it clear early on that she wasn\u2019t going to be a fish farmer.\n She gestured to the server. The woman must have read her face, because she approached, looking worried.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t Skuja terroir. Or any of the others. Did you print it? That\u2019s fraud.\u201d\n The plate was whisked away at high speed. \u201cOur apologies. The beer will be on the house. Can we offer you anything else to eat?\u201d\n Havi raised her brows. \u201cA bowl of plain rice. I can stomach that from the printer.\u201d\n She waited for her rice, sipping her beer. Why had she come here? The urge to feel solid ground under her feet, wind in her hair, and sun on her face had been stronger than her career and circle of friends. Yet how was she going to find a job on the planet without running into her parents? She hadn\u2019t made any progress in solving that hurdle.\n The server coughed. She and another woman stood at the table. \u201cMx? The owner would like a word.\u201d\n Havi opened her eyes.\n \u201cI\u2019m so very sorry, esteemed lady. We are out of stock on Skuja fish. We shouldn\u2019t have served you printed stuff. Please don\u2019t write about it. We\u2019re trying to solve the problem quietly.\u201d\n Havi sat up straighter. What problem? The owner bent closer. \u201cThere are complications with delivery. We just can\u2019t get any. Something\u2019s going down on Knossos and nobody\u2019s been able to tell us what. \u2018Service suspended for the time being.\u2019 So what can we do? We\u2019re a fish restaurant. We serve printed copies of Knossos fish, genetically exact copies, let me tell you, to the people from out-system. But you knew. You tasted the difference. I guess you are from Knossos?\u201d\n \u201cIndeed I am. Skuja Clan, in fact.\u201d\n The owner reddened.\n \u201cOkay, sorry to hear that. I\u2019ll go and visit Fishy, then.\u201d\n \u201cOh, no, no dear lady,\u201d the proprietress hastened to say. \u201cNobody\u2019s been getting fish deliveries. We\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d\n There was an opportunity here. \u201cWhat have you done so far to figure out the trouble? Anybody been talking to the fish farms?\u201d Havi asked.\n \u201cThe Restaurateurs\u2019 Association has tried. But it feels like they\u2019re stalling. Maybe there\u2019s a problem with production? Or they\u2019ve sold all their stock to a new buyer?\u201d\n \u201cHave you gone down to investigate?\u201d\n \u201cMe, into the gravity well? Oh no, lady, too rich for my blood. Open skies and who knows if you\u2019d ever get back up . . . \u201d\n Havi leaned forward. \u201cWhat if I go down and investigate for you? I feel that the Restaurateurs\u2019 Association might benefit from having an ear and an eye on the ground, so to speak.\u201d\n Her earnings and kudos had been pretty much spent on the trip. She needed work. How could she pass up this opportunity?\n She couldn\u2019t.\n Maybe Havi had never been the smartest or most diligent of students. But she had moments of great insight, though not always ones she could use. For instance, when she was sixteen, experiencing her first date with handsome jock Dara under the rainbow of summer moons. Dara\u2019s body, glistening with sweat, was poised right above her. Havi lay back, waiting while he took a selfie of his moonlit body, maybe a little bit bemused by the whole thing, but interested and willing. They\u2019d finally managed to ditch Havi\u2019s little sister, swum to one of the few Paal temples above water, and were occupying the altar-like slab in the top room.\n Havi waited and stared through the triangular window. She blinked at the three stars shining through, also arranged like a triangle. Like the ones at the wormhole. She had one of her first flashes of insight. Not the first, that had been at twelve, when she realized her parents were human beings just like herself and therefore capable of massive confusion and getting things completely wrong. This one was about herself and what she was doing here down in the gravity well. It was like a prison. One she needed to escape from.\n She wriggled out from under Dara and started taking pictures of the star formation.\n Dara never forgave her. Knossos was never the same after the starships started arriving and the derelict wormhole hub orbiting the sun got fixed up. Knossos fish became a galactic delicacy. Her parents became rich. Havi ran away from home.\n Havi stepped out of the shuttle onto the floating shuttle dock of Continent Five. After haggling with the restaurant owner until they\u2019d reached an agreeable compromise, she\u2019d stumbled to her coffin hotel and slept like a human being. Most aliens, or fish for that matter, never slept. She\u2019d dialed up some random breakfast and made it to the shuttle transfer to Knossos station and down planet just in time.\n Continent was a big word. There was no dry land on Knossos. On continents, the sea was from an inch to two meters deep, in oceans up to kilometers. Every bit of its submerged surface was completely covered in Paal labyrinths. And fish. Humans, limping through the galaxy, fleeing the Katabiotic destruction of their home planet, had been delighted to find any intact planet that didn\u2019t outright kill them. They had settled on it in spite of the obvious downsides.\n Havi blinked against the bright sun. She\u2019d forgotten how dim everything had seemed when first leaving her home world, but she\u2019d adjusted. She dialed up her cornea protection and resigned herself to a few days of glare headache.\n The shuttle port floated on lightly ruffled, turquoise wavelets, small spokes radiating out from its hub for stability and to serve as docks for hovercraft. If you didn\u2019t look too closely, the labyrinth beneath the waves was invisible. Today she was the only person getting off, nobody got on, no hovers were docked. It might be a random lull in traffic, or was she seeing the results of an economic slump?\n She was here to find that out. And she might as well head home right away. Get it over with. Face the recriminations.\n She stepped off the dock onto the top of the Paal labyrinth wall and started sloshing through the warm sea. The tops of the walls were about ten to fifteen centimeters under water, and thirty centimeters wide. She\u2019d done this barefoot all her life, but mindful of her space-tenderized soles, she\u2019d brought water shoes.\n \u201cMx! Mx!\u201d The shuttle field attendant called out. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe. There are currents. Wait for the hover boat!\u201d\n Currents? Pfft. She waved her thanks. \u201cI grew up here. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n The attendant emailed her a rights waiver, which she signed. Safety first, though it seemed a little over the top. As she splashed through the shallows on top of the labyrinth walls, jumping over the narrow corridors, on the fastest route to Skuja Farm, she set her inphone to access the local webs. It was a three-hour walk; she might as well use the time to update herself on the latest news.\n First, she skimmed the feeds. What she didn\u2019t find was news about the fish shortage. Nothing about fish whatsoever. Back in the day, the Continent Five news had shared weekly tidbits about particularly good catches, fish populations, taste changes, currents, and winds. That column seemed to have gone.\n Conclusion: something was definitely going on. Well, she\u2019d be home in less than three hours and her parents would update her on the situation.\n Her foot slid off the wall and she plunged down into the corridor. The water should have been no more than a meter deep, but the wall went up and up before her surprised eyes and she was at least three meters deep before her feet hit bottom. The whole of Continent Five didn\u2019t have a labyrinth that deep. The Paal labyrinths had always been just under water. So how could the walls be so high here? Had they grown? Or had the sea bottom washed away?\n Havi swam up, sputtering seawater, and hoisted herself back up the wall. Hm. Maybe the shuttle port attendant had been right. Maybe she didn\u2019t know the current circumstances well enough to be walking in a vast desert of sea-covered labyrinth walls.\n The horizon lay featureless and hazy in the late afternoon light.\n Late afternoon? Drat. She\u2019d forgotten to sync to planet time. It might have been morning on Malala hub, but that meant nothing to a planet that twirled through space regardless of human time.\n This was not the moment to panic. She knew this place like the taste of her family\u2019s fish, if need be in the middle of a moonless night. She used to, anyway.\n Havi flicked a few drops of briny onto her tongue. She was where she thought she was. Every farm in the labyrinth had its own terroir, which gave the fish of Knossos their famous flavor. She was still good at this. She\u2019d just have to follow her gut and ignore the minor changes eleven years had wrought.\n She got up, adjusted her backpack, dialed up her shades. Onward.\n An hour or so ahead was the old temple where she and Dara had had their failed tryst. If all went wrong, she could sleep there. The altar slab would be hard, but at least dry.\n More than an hour went by. No temple in sight. Still not a problem. Havi was sure she was walking slightly slower due to her time in space and different gravities, and maybe she was taking a bit more care after her fall. It wasn\u2019t an issue.\n Dusk drizzled down quicker than she remembered. Still no temple. She\u2019d taken a wrong turn, or the temple was gone, or she was only half as fast as she thought she was. If only she hadn\u2019t signed that shuttle port waiver. She was getting tired. A rescue by hover boat would have been pretty nice right now.\n Still, she wasn\u2019t in any real danger. She\u2019d only be sore and tired after perching on a wall all night. It was just odd that all the corridors had gotten so much deeper.\n She slipped again and hit her chin, hard, on the wall in front of her. She didn\u2019t fall off, but only barely. Checking her jaws for loose teeth, she tasted blood in her mouth. Her skull rang and she had to blink away dizziness. That really hurt.\n Time to regroup. She rummaged in her backpack for a salve and filled her purifier with seawater. The UBI ration bars from the coffin hotel that she\u2019d over-cautiously thrown in would now be her dinner. She gnawed on the flat-tasting bars and tried to ignore her stinging chin and bitten tongue. Not to mention her scraped knees from the earlier fall.\n She wouldn\u2019t die but it still wasn\u2019t fun. She\u2019d arrive home by morning. Everybody knew the shuttle schedule and would wonder, but still. No harm done. No need to call the people she specifically didn\u2019t want to ask for help.\n She could walk for a bit until true night and then wait for the moons to rise. Revived after her dinner, she set off again. The last reflected glow of the sun, to her back on the left, assured her she was still on track. With the darkness growing, a faint scent started to rise from the briny, and a murmur she hadn\u2019t heard before. The surface looked strange as well, in a way she couldn\u2019t put her finger on right away. When Baby Moon rose, it illuminated the sea with its pink glow.\n Now the cause of the scents and the murmuring became clear. The water around her had a current. To her left, the water rushed glimmering to the west. Now what? It wasn\u2019t migration season; she\u2019d at least checked up on that. The seas had always been warm, silent, the currents running unnoticed. Funny peculiar, that was for sure.\n The warm water lapped her ankles. Maybe it was a little deeper than before?\n The next few steps brought the water swirling up until her knees. Havi stopped to consider her options. Within half a minute the water was up to her thighs. What could possibly cause this? The moons\u2019 tides were negligible. The labyrinth itself?\n She groaned. If she started swimming, she\u2019d lose contact with the labyrinth and anyway, she couldn\u2019t swim all night. Now she had to call the people she didn\u2019t want to. She turned on her locator beacon and sent out a call to her parents\u2019 fish farm.\n The phone was picked up immediately.\n \u201cI heard from Alexa down at the port you\u2019d gone walking. Need picking up?\u201d her sister said.\n Havi\u2019s cheeks burned. So she had been recognized after all. Her foolishness was all over the fishing community already. Wait. If Ivete knew, and knew about the changed conditions, she could have picked Havi up hours ago. The asshole. Ivete had deliberately let it come to this. Was this payback for Havi\u2019s leaving? Great.\n \u201cThanks sis. Got my location?\u201d\n \u201cYup.\u201d\n Lights went on about half a kilometer in the direction of her family\u2019s house and started moving toward her. Oh, the hover boat had been waiting for her with doused lights?\n Havi looked down at the water now tugging at her waist. If she hadn\u2019t called, they\u2019d probably have swooped in a minute later anyway. She had no clue what was going on with the labyrinth, but it was clearly unsafe as hell.\n She stood waiting as the water rose up to her chest, already starting to float when the boat whispered up and someone threw a lit life buoy over to her. As the boat winched her in, she unclenched her jaws. No need to let them know she was angry. They knew. They wanted it that way.\n Her father and sister hauled Havi up to the deck. She stood dripping and just looked at them.\n \u201cGuess you didn\u2019t lose your sense of direction,\u201d her father said. \u201cIf the eddies hadn\u2019t started up, you would have walked straight home.\u201d\n That sounded pretty close to an olive branch. Havi wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready to take it after these childish shenanigans. She held out her hand anyway. Her father shook it, no expression on his face. Still keeping things tightly bottled up. Yeah, she wasn\u2019t going to give him a hug until he started it.\n Ivete, her sister, stood at the wheel and barely nodded.\n Havi punched Ivete lightly in the shoulder. \u201cHey.\u201d\n Ivete punched Havi back. Unnecessarily hard. \u201cWelcome home, sib,\u201d Ivete said. It sounded way too perky after the mean punch, which would leave a bruise.\n \u201cA warning would have been nice,\u201d Havi said.\n \u201cYou telling us you were visiting would have been nice. Or a Christmas card every other year?\u201d\n Havi had stopped sending them after she never got any replies.\n So they weren\u2019t fine. She got the message. But why, after all these years? Havi felt a surge of anger. What old beef could possibly be worth nearly letting her drown? Their own daughter and sister? Come on.\n The hover took off. Havi relaxed and watched Blue Moon rise. Lilac night was the best time of night. Glarus, the big green moon, wouldn\u2019t be up until early morning.\n \u201cI could use a second dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything in the fridge?\u201d\n Her dad and Ivete exchanged looks.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not been a good year. The fish are acting weird. And last year was bad too. The Fish Migration Guard must have let a stranger fish through, and the offspring tasted weird. We had to taste each and every one, so we sold only fillets that year. This year, with the eddies and the labyrinth acting up, we\u2019re just not in control of the fish anymore. Most of them got away.\u201d\n Havi opened her mouth to respond, but didn\u2019t.\n If it was like that all over the world, that certainly explained why nobody on Knossos was sending their fish up into space. This was going to ruin the planet\u2019s reputation. Her parents\u2019 business would go under. Everybody\u2019s business would go under. It was more serious than the Restaurateurs\u2019 Association had made it sound.\n So maybe the reunion with her parents was going to be more worst-case scenario than pink-tinted, but she had to get to the bottom of this mystery. She was still a Knossos girl at heart.\n As the boat rushed over the waters, the violent glimmering on the water surface indicated that something a little more powerful than \u201ceddies\u201d was going on. Havi personally would have called them maelstroms or vortices. In hindsight, she felt a thrill of fear over her recent ordeal. That would have ended very badly if her family hadn\u2019t shown up in time. She considered suing dumbass Alexa from the spaceport. Just sending a rights waiver wasn\u2019t really sufficient customer care. If she\u2019d really been an outworlder . . . but no, Alexa, last name unknown, had apparently recognized her as a scion of the Skuja family.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s Alexa spaceport\u2019s last name?\u201d\n \u201cThinking of revenge?\u201d Ivete said. \u201cDon\u2019t. We persuaded her not to send out a rescue.\u201d\n What had Havi ever done to deserve a family like this? Leave home to pursue an education and a career away from fish? Big whoop.\n Ivete\u2019s face broke into a wide, smug grin, painted lilac by the moons. \u201cAnd anyway, she\u2019s Dara\u2019s little sister.\u201d\n Havi rolled her eyes. \u201cNot him again. Ever.\u201d\n The serrated outlines of the family farm popped up on the horizon, the lit contours stark white against the purple sky.\n The next morning, Havi squinted against the sun glaring off the solar arrays as the stared down at the family farm. Everything was different. The corridors were at least two meters deep, and the fish didn\u2019t swim their usual figure eight, but something far more complicated. She knelt down on her floater pad and swiped a pink fish from the shoal. She headed, gutted, and filleted it. The first raw bite definitely tasted different. Good, but not the taste of home farm.\n When she\u2019d come home last night, her father had cooked a meal entirely without fish or garum, the salty, spicy sauce made from fish remnants.\n Mom had also refused to talk shop that late at night. Mom was the boss, so everyone trooped meekly to bed after feeding Havi. Havi had thought it prudent to eat breakfast before talking to Mom.\n Yes. Strange tastes, strange swimming patterns, seabed dropping. How was that even possible? Havi went inside and called up tidal stats. They made no sense anymore. The three moons had always exerted a gentle pull on the planet\u2019s shallow oceans, but the last year, tidal movements had splintered into much smaller whirlings and eddies and strange weaves of shallow and deepwater streams. Oceanographers were still exploring the patterns and the cause of the change.\n Changes didn\u2019t happen out of nowhere. Havi called up meteorologist reports, astronomers\u2019 blogs, but they reported nothing out of the ordinary.\n She enlarged the live tidal display from the satellite network. Zoomed out more. If she looked at the whole hemisphere at once, it almost seemed like there was a pattern. But it wasn\u2019t complete. It seemed broken, interrupted. She zoomed in on one of the pattern breaks. Osaka Barrier. A recent, human-made, barricade to keep the fish from swarming, intermingling, and ruining their famous taste.\n Time to talk to the farm manager. Mom.\n Her mother was seated, frowning, behind a big screen showing the flow inside the family farm. The shoal swam around and around, as always, but there was a distinct pause at the closed tidal gate.\n \u201cIt\u2019s as if they want to leave,\u201d Havi said. \u201cBut why? They\u2019ve been fine here all their lives.\u201d\n Mom looked up at Havi. \u201cStep away from the monitor. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s rude to look over people\u2019s shoulders? And this farm is not yours anymore, as you made very clear, so none of your business.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not random curiosity, Mom! Don\u2019t you realize your livelihood is in danger? As well as everybody else\u2019s, including restaurateurs all over known space?\u201d\n \u201cI do. But I only share family secrets with people involved in the family business. Go try the neighbors to see if they want you poking around.\u201d\n Jesus.\n \u201cThey might be more open, not having a baseless grudge against me,\u201d Havi snapped. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a worldwide concern? Aren\u2019t you guys working together to find out the cause for this?\u201d\n \u201cOf course we are. We\u2019re negotiating agreements to keep our trade secrets safe. When we\u2019ve got a covenant, we\u2019ll start our own investigation.\u201d\n \u201cWhat trade secrets?\u201d Havi asked. She couldn\u2019t think of any she didn\u2019t already know, having spent her youth as unpaid labor on the farm. \u201cAnd when are you expecting this covenant to emerge?\u201d\n \u201cAs I said, not unless you want to join the family business.\u201d\n Like hell she was.\n \u201cAnd what do you mean by random grudge? As if you didn\u2019t realize what you were doing to us. As if you don\u2019t know how hard it was to keep Ivete out of jail after that shuttle port business,\u201d her mother said.\n \u201cJail? What shuttle port business?\u201d\n \u201cYes, pretend to be innocent. Good Havi, who ignores everything that\u2019s going on under her nose.\u201d\n \u201cMom, are you even taking this seriously? If things go on like this, you won\u2019t have a business.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be dramatic, dear, you should have outgrown that by now. Things have always been fine. Of course we will find a way to get back to normal. Build another barrier, maybe, or another way to control the swarming and the eddies. They\u2019re only fish.\u201d\n Havi got up and went out, before she said things she\u2019d regret. She knelt down by one of the enclosed corridors where the family grew earth produce: seaweed, sea potatoes and limpets, gene engineered to provide human beings with the right nutrients. The Paal fish were the most important ingredients to give this diet variety and flavor.\n She took off her shoes, stepped down into the lukewarm water of the basin, sun blazing down on her neck, and inhaled the fragrance that rose up from the water gardens. Seaweed in all colors between pink and dark green waved gently in the current. Limpets and shells pocked the sides.\n She put some pinkies, strands of grassy kelp, and a limpet in her mouth and chewed furiously. Why did her parents, and possibly most of their fellow fish keepers, refuse to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation? She couldn\u2019t understand it. It stared them right in the face.\n But then again, they\u2019d seen things get worse so slowly they might have failed to notice the enormous gap between how things had been eleven years ago and now.\n Would there be any point in talking to other families? Might they have noticed other phenomena that would clarify the situation? She\u2019d better, even if she didn\u2019t think it would yield new info, just to be complete. She needed other points of view. She\u2019d covered weather, water, and fishing. What else? The Paal, their labyrinths, and the fish themselves.\n After filling herself up, she clambered out and looked back with a frown. Current, what current? Hadn\u2019t her mom always told her the earth gardens were kept completely separate from the rest of the briny? Sure, the doors kept the fish out. But if there was a current, earth nutrients could get into the ocean. Another strike on the tally of human influence of Knossos\u2019 \u201cnatural\u201d, that is, Paal-instigated, processes. Hm. Wouldn\u2019t proliferating bacteria or the kitchen gardens\u2019 waste ruin the terroir?\n She ran back over the tops of the labyrinth to the main house. It floated over the shadow gardens, where fungi grew. Fish genetics weren\u2019t her first priority, but her sister who could tell her all about it, was right here. She swallowed. Time to face the music.\n The door opened right after knocking. Havi hadn\u2019t expected that. She stepped inside slowly and coughed.\n \u201cHey Ivete. How are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cNo small talk,\u201d Ivete said. \u201cJust ask your questions.\u201d\n No truce then. Fish talk first, then the family questions.\n \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re willing to talk to me. Mom just shooed me out. Why are you guys still mad at me? I don\u2019t see choosing a different career path as such a big crime. And what about the shuttle port?\u201d\n Ivete took a deep breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t let go, can you? Just when I was being the better person, putting business interests over my own feelings. Did you ever think you were making a major impact on my life? That by choosing to leave, you took away my choice?\u201d\n Such hot waves of anger came off Ivete that Havi almost took a step backward. \u201cI didn\u2019t force you to do anything. If you wanted another career, Mom and Dad would just have had to sell the business. It\u2019s your life. As it\u2019s mine.\u201d\n Ivete slammed her hand on the desk. \u201cSo hurray, you\u2019re better at withstanding parental pressure than me.\u201d\n \u201cAnd the shuttle port?\u201d\n Ivete shrugged. \u201cI tried to blow up the shuttle port after you left. I was just a kid. Not the port\u2019s fault, I see that now.\u201d\n Whoa. Havi didn\u2019t know what to say. That was a little more than youthful high spirits. She\u2019d never thought about the impact her leaving would have had on Ivete. She still didn\u2019t doubt her right to choose her own life, but she wished she\u2019d been able to support Ivete more.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.\n Ivete only huffed.\n Havi took a deep breath. She couldn\u2019t undo this old damage with a single apology. She was going to ask the questions she\u2019d come for. \u201cI\u2019m looking into the mysterious fish behavior and taste. Is there anything interesting about their genetics you can tell me?\u201d\n \u201cNobody ever asks,\u201d Ivete said. \u201cBut yes, I can.\u201d\n She opened up a tree chart on a large screen. Havi didn\u2019t know what she was looking at until she zoomed in on the top branch. \u201cSkuja\u201d it said.\n \u201cThis is what humans found when they landed here.\u201d A struggling fleet of mere thousands, the last survivors of the destroyed Earth, fleeing the Katabiotics.\n \u201cThe Paal had engineered the minimalist but still functioning ecosystem, consisting of no more than the fish, several branches of seaweeds, algae, and slime, no more than twenty-three bacteria. That was all. And so far, impervious to human bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\u201d\n Havi thought she understood, even though she didn\u2019t know where this fact was leading.\n \u201cOf course we fish farmers are actively trying to maintain that unique genetic signature, for its flavor. So since the advent of humanity, two hundred years ago, the Fish Migration Guard tracks down and destroys stray fish or shoals. That\u2019s why Osaka Barrier was put up. Me and Dad helped build it.\n \u201cBut we can also track the fishes\u2019 genetic history for far longer, even back to when the Paal created them. They made sixty-five unique species, so far less than we have now.\n \u201cSince the origin of these fish, so many hybrids have originated that only a few of the original mixes still exist. The rest is all hybridized. We can tentatively conclude that the Paal intended for hybridization to happen. How they made the fish capable of mating is a fascinating story.\u201d\n \u201cFor another day,\u201d Havi said quickly.\n \u201cOr how they made it so that many types of aliens, among others the humans and the Gukke, could eat and enjoy the fish.\u201d\n \u201cAlso another day.\u201d\n Havi couldn\u2019t tell from Ivete\u2019s neck if she was disappointed in Havi\u2019s curtailing of her digressions.\n \u201cSo do these facts shed any light on what\u2019s going on with the fish?\u201d\n Ivete shrugged. \u201cNot that I know of. I\u2019ve sequenced dozens of wrong-tasting fish. They\u2019re all hybrids from existing strains. It\u2019s odd that they are breeding out of season, but well, who knows why?\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that also biology?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s observed behavior, ecology. I\u2019m all about the genetics.\u201d\n \u201cNo insights about the labyrinths rising, or the seabed falling? The eddies?\u201d\n Ivete looked unconcerned. Why would she pretend that?\n Havi waited. Nothing more was forthcoming from her sister\u2019s averted back.\n It didn\u2019t feel as if the past issues had been resolved even a little bit.\n Havi sat down at her mother\u2019s desk and fired off messages to universities and researchers. An urgency tugged at her. She couldn\u2019t pinpoint the source of it. After all, the fish scarcity had been going on for months, the gradual rising of the labyrinths for years. There was no rational explanation for her sense of hurry. But her gut was her best guide, so she always took it seriously.\n The astronomer and the meteorologist reacted the quickest. Sadly, they lived on the other side of the planet, but she made appointments to face-call them. In her career as a journalist, she\u2019d noticed she got a better rapport and more information if she met people in the flesh. Something about the subliminal scents and body language of an actual human being, maybe. The archeologist, who hadn\u2019t replied, was a short hover boat ride away. Havi decided to visit her first, welcome or not.\n She left a note saying she\u2019d borrowed Ivete\u2019s hover and left. The archaeologist\u2019s floating camp was near the Paal temple she knew so well. People knew so little about the Paal, even after living on Knossos for two hundred years.\n The platform wobbled as she stepped onto it. A chunky machine sitting on the other edge churbled along quietly. Probably diving equipment. Before long, the tone of the diving monitor changed.\n The first divers didn\u2019t even notice her sitting there until they\u2019d taken off their helmets and deactivated their suits.\n Havi coughed. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to Dr. Furuzan?\u201d\n The oldest of the women stuck up her hand.\n \u201cHi, I\u2019m Havi Kuja. I\u2019ve been commissioned to look into the past years\u2019 fish troubles. One of the things that stood out was the labyrinth changes. Do you have time to talk to me about that? Is it something you\u2019ve noticed?\u201d\n Furuzan laughed. \u201cWriting about it is the only thing that got me sponsors and students, so yeah.\u201d\n \u201cDid you realize it also had an effect on the fish farms? The fish have changed behavior and taste different.\u201d\n \u201cI heard some rumors, but since we don\u2019t have money for real fish, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. Wow. How interesting. Do you have proof that the two are interrelated?\u201d Furuzan asked.\n \u201cNot scientific proof, no. This is just a preliminary investigation. But it seems pretty unlikely that two such events are coincidental, doesn\u2019t it, after millennia of stasis?\u201d\n Furuzan waggled her head. \u201cWe think millennia of stasis. Those few satellite photos we have from the Gukke don\u2019t really prove nothing happened in between. And don\u2019t forget the arrival of humans as agents of change. But I get your point.\u201d\n \u201cSo, what can you tell me about the Paal? Why did they build these labyrinths, why they designed this specific ecosystem?\u201d\n \u201cI wish! We don\u2019t even know what they looked like, since the Gukke, who actually met living Paal a couple of thousand years ago, never bothered to film them or preserve the memory.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m investigating for the fishing and restaurant industry. Knossos\u2019 economy is going to collapse if the fish problem continues. Anything you can tell me about the Paal and the labyrinths,\u201d Havi said.\n \u201cYou probably knew the labyrinths extend several meters down into the soil? So they haven\u2019t been growing. The continents\u2019 seafloor has been slowly sucked out by currents. I have a hunch that the labyrinths have some connection with wind, tides, and currents. The currents in the briny are fueled by massive water vortices in the oceans. Where, as you also were aware, I assume, the labyrinths continue. All over the globe.\u201d\n \u201cHas anyone ever completely charted them?\u201d Havi asked.\n \u201cNot really.\u201d\n \u201cI wonder why the first settlers never bothered to explore further. I would have.\u201d\n Furuzan shrugged. \u201cThey were refugees from Earth, fleeing the Katabiotics, probably had lived in cramped ship clouds for generations. They were just happy to find a habitable planet, to be free of the Katabiotics.\u201d\n \u201cSo did the Katabiotic aliens also kill the Paal?\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know that the Paal are extinct. We only know they\u2019re gone from this planet. But where they are, all dead, sublimed to another plane of existence, moved to the Magellan Cloud . . . nobody knows.\u201d\n Havi felt a stirring of instinct. Something here. \u201cWe have found very few intact planets, haven\u2019t we? Almost all destroyed by the Katabiotics. I wonder why this planet is still here.\u201d\n \u201cInteresting question, but outside my purview. We\u2019re just cataloging the newly accessible labyrinths walls. \u201c\n \u201cCan you show me?\u201d Havi asked. The stirring inside her was fainter now, but it wasn\u2019t gone.\n \u201cSure. For example, the structure the locals call the temple. Let me show you what it looks like now.\u201d Furuzan gestured to the water, where something triangular stuck up about twenty meters away. It was about ten meters wide and three high. Must be the remnant of the temple.\n \u201cI can\u2019t dive,\u201d Havi said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a short walk and it\u2019s only submerged up to the chest. Well, you\u2019re tall. To the waist.\u201d\n They balanced over the labyrinth walls and clambered through the temple\u2019s windows into a triangular space that stretched away to its point about fifteen meters away. The stone floor was completely submerged now.\n Havi landed in warm water, slick stone beneath her feet. The slab where she and Dara had not made love was only visible as a disturbance in the water\u2019s gentle eddying.\n The pictorials on the wall were fuzzier and less deep than she remembered. She moved closer to the left-hand walls. They\u2019d always been called pictorials, she wasn\u2019t sure why. The shapes she saw were abstract and organic, created by thousands of little triangular stones or bricks.\n \u201cLook at the walls, and then at this picture. The reliefs on the wall have moved two millimeters.\u201d\n Havi had already seen it. \u201cI used to hang out in this place all the time. They\u2019ve moved a lot more than two millimeters. The design is completely different.\u201d\n She waded toward the far wall, where once a beautiful spiraling relief mural had been, and now only faint bumps were visible. The bumps didn\u2019t even make a picture anymore. \u201cDon\u2019t touch it!\u201d Furuzan cried out.\n Havi put her hand on it anyway. She was sure she\u2019d touched the temple walls before and nothing had happened.\n The wall moved beneath her fingers. The stone sucked at her skin, refusing to let her hand move away.\n Havi yelped in surprise and yanked her hand back. A faint whorl of blood showed in the water before it was washed away by a suddenly stronger current.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What does this mean?\u201d\n \u201cI was about to tell you this. The wall moves, it makes patterns. All the labyrinths we\u2019ve seen do. I would guess that all of them are doing that. They react to our presence, and even more so to our touch.\u201d\n \u201cAre the walls alive?\u201d Havi asked, loath to touch them again.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think so, although since they\u2019re alien, who knows. More like automatons, maybe?\u201d\n The whirr of a hover boat became audible. The briny sloshed through the room.\n \u201cAnother visitor?\u201d Furuzan said.\n Light brighter than the day strobed through the narrow window slots of the temple. \u201cThis is the police. Come out slowly.\u201d\n The police? Havi and Furuzan looked at each other. There wasn\u2019t a lot of crime on Knossos, and if there was, it was usually dealt with in-house or in-family.\n Havi clambered out first, squinting against the mega lights.\n \u201cDid you arrive on hover boat DG211?\u201d the augmented voice asked, although the police hover was no more than twenty feet away.\n \u201cYep, that\u2019s me.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest for theft. Turn your back and hold out your wrists.\u201d\n Havi was too surprised not to comply. It was her family\u2019s boat. She\u2019d left a note. What the hell?\n A person stepped off the hover onto the temple ridge. He clocked handcuffs onto her wrists.\n \u201cTurn.\u201d\n Havi turned. His voice sounded familiar.\n The lights powered down.\n The policeman turned out to be Dara.\n \u201cHavi?\u201d he said, sounding a lot less surprised than she felt.\n \u201cYes. Why am I under arrest? Who called in the boat as stolen? That\u2019s my family\u2019s boat.\u201d\n Dara looked sheepish. \u201cIvete called. She didn\u2019t say it was you.\u201d\n Havi snorted. She believed him about Ivete\u2019s call, but not so much about him not knowing it was her. And how had Ivete managed to pinpoint Dara as the arresting officer, had she called him out of his bed on the neighboring farm or had he just happened to be on duty? But she\u2019d give Dara the benefit of the doubt. Not so much Ivete. \u201cThat little idiot. Okay, are you going to take the cuffs off?\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I have to take you to the station now. And process this officially.\u201d\n \u201cJeezus.\u201d\n Havi sat on a bench in the floating police station, hands cuffed, in growing annoyance. Dara administrated slower than slow, drinking endless cups of fish tea without offering her any. Processing officially her ass.\n The silence was rudely broken by a raucous blare of sound. \u201cWhat the hell is that? Turn it off!\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s a siren. I think. A warning. Emergency.\u201d\n \u201cFor what? A storm?\u201d\n Dara raked his hands through his hair. \u201cI think we covered this in training. Once. I have to look it up to be sure.\u201d\n Havi saw her chance. \u201cIf there\u2019s an emergency situation, you can\u2019t guarantee my safety. You have to release me.\u201d\n \u201cJust wait, okay? I\u2019m looking it up.\u201d\n The siren continued to grate across Havi\u2019s nerves while Dara, increasingly nervous, browsed through his instruction manuals.\n Dara gestured her to his terminal. \u201cI found it. Look. It says it\u2019s a warning against Katabiotic invasion!\u201d\n News flashes started to scroll across her vision, emergency overrides from her inphone.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the wormhole hub. It\u2019s under attack. I can\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s millions of people.\u201d Dara was panting, the whites of eyes showing. How had she ever for a moment considered him handsome fifteen years ago?\n \u201cDara, get a grip. Untie me. Tell me what to do.\u201d\n Dara unlocked her cuffs with shaking hands. \u201cI\u2019m the officer on duty.\u201d\n Havi forced her voice to stay calm. \u201cFor this region. Sure. Where is the worldwide headquarters?\u201d\n \u201cHere! I told you!\u201d\n \u201cThat can\u2019t be true. How many of you are there?\u201d\n \u201cSeven,\u201d Dara said.\n \u201cFor the whole planet?\u201d\n Dara started calling up his colleagues, his voice horse.\n Havi stifled her questions. Dara was a bit slow, but he was doing the job.\n After that, Dara showed her the information from the police database. \u201cKatabiotic event. Call up oikotekts. (What is an oikotekt?) While you wait for their help to arrive, remember Katabiotic interference is a quantum event. Observe your surroundings continuously, reinforcing their stability.\u201d\n She read the paragraph out loud. \u201cDo you know what this means?\u201d\n \u201cThere was a training exercise. We were standing in a circle and had to keep looking at each other and the room in a figure eight pattern. Very tiring. I got really dizzy.\u201d\n \u201cSo how would we do this?\u201d\n \u201cStand in a circle.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s two of us,\u201d Havi said.\n \u201cUm, yes, I guess back-to-back?\u201d\n They stood back-to-back. In spite of her annoyance at his slowness and nerves, it was reassuring to feel a warm, living human being against her back. His physical solidness grounded her.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with your colleagues?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cThey\u2019re organizing Katabiotic resistance. They need to get these instructions out to everyone.\u201d\n Seven cops for a whole world. Great. Who else could they call on? Of course. Fish Migration Control!\n \u201cDara, get the same directive to FMC. They have a lot more hovers and warm bodies.\u201d\n \u201cAlready did that. Look, Havi. Look at the fish.\u201d\n She walked to the window. The police station didn\u2019t float over a farm, but the briny was full of glinting fish backs. Thousands of fish, millions of fish, swimming. And not just randomly. Patterns.\n Just like the patterns on the temple wall.\n \u201cCall up the FMC satellite feeds.\u201d\n Dara complied. \u201cZoom in.\u201d\n It was like looking at a different planet. The fish weren\u2019t swimming around placidly in their local farm labyrinths anymore. They were swarming, circling, spiraling in large-scale patterns. Patterns the size of continents. All the fish must have escaped their farms.\n There had to be a connection between the incoming Katabiotic attack and the fish behavior. But what?\n Havi remembered Ivete telling her that the fish were conscious beings, about as intelligent as Earth fish had once been. Not very, that meant, but they did have awareness and memory, up to a point.\n Not there yet.\n She called up the astronomer she\u2019d been about to visit. The woman wasn\u2019t answering. She left an urgent message.\n Within a minute the astronomer called back.\n \u201cMs. Skuja, this is a bad time. We\u2019re all observing the skies for signs of the Katabiotics,\u201d the woman said.\n \u201cI\u2019m at Police Headquarters, assisting in the defense effort.\u201d Wow, that came out slick. \u201cWe need help. Just a few moments of your time. Explain to me in simple terms about quantum events and observation?\u201d\n \u201cWe learned, centuries ago, that if we managed to observe our surroundings intensively enough, or with the right kind of attention, that the Katabiotic changes can\u2019t take place. It\u2019s like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat, once you look in the box, the cat is either dead or not. As long as you don\u2019t look, its state is uncertain. The Katabiotics can only act in the uncertain state.\u201d\n \u201cIs it only human beings who can do this quantum observation?\u201d\n The astronomer pulled at her chin. \u201cI have no idea. But I don\u2019t see why. A higher animal, like a mammal, would be able to observe whether a cat was dead or not.\u201d\n \u201cThanks!\u201d Havi hung up.\n The Paal had built the labyrinths, an unknown but long time ago.\n Havi had always thought of the labyrinths as ruins, remnants of a dead species that had left the planet for its own incomprehensible reasons. But what if the labyrinth wasn\u2019t a ruin of something else, but fish and labyrinth together were a machine, built for a purpose? And something had triggered that purpose?\n \u201cThe fish are defending us,\u201d she told Dara, who was still diligently observing his surroundings in a figure eight pattern.\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t stop. The fish observe the planet. That\u2019s why this planet is the only one in the whole region that is still intact. It\u2019s the fish. It\u2019s a fish defense system.\u201d\n Dara giggled.\n Havi slapped him. \u201cFocus. Dara, focus. Zoom out from that satellite feed. We need to check on the fish. If they\u2019re covering everywhere.\u201d\n A quick glance at the other four continents showed that the fish patterns seemed intricate and smoothly flowing. It was a different story on Continent Five. In the middle of the continent a large break showed in the pattern. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d\n \u201cOsaka Barrier,\u201d Dara said. \u201cCompleted five years ago.\u201d\n Havi knew what to do. \u201cIt\u2019s the barrier. It\u2019s ruining the fish flow. We have to blow it up. Come on, Dara.\u201d\n \u201cWhat? No. We can\u2019t. It\u2019s against the law. That\u2019s people\u2019s livelihoods.\u201d\n \u201cThose people would complain even more if the planet started breaking up because the physical constants of the universe had changed. Remember what happened to Earth? We all watched the video!\u201d\n Dara scratched his head. \u201cBut . . . \u201d\n \u201cWhatever. Come.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I\u2019m not destroying an important structure on your say-so. My duty is here, leading the defense efforts.\u201d\n Havi wanted to slap him again.\n \u201cGive me the keys to Ivete\u2019s boat then. I have to do this.\u201d\n She jumped on board the hover boat and set course toward the barrier It had become night and all three of the moons were out. Baby, Blue Moon, and Glarus, also known as the Big Green Cheese. Their rainbow light glinted off the billions of shiny fish backs coursing through the water. The boat hovered not over the briny, but over a solid carpet of glistening fish spines. Beautiful.\n She couldn\u2019t do this alone, though. She didn\u2019t know a thing about explosives or how to destroy large man-made structures. Shit. There was only one person she could call.\n Her fucking annoying little sister.\n \u201cHey Ivete, it\u2019s me. I need your help.\u201d\n \u201cYeah right. How\u2019s the police station treating you?\u201d\n \u201cThat was pretty annoying. I admit that. But now there\u2019s an emergency and I need your help. You know how to blow up stuff,\u201d Havi said.\n \u201cWhat? No.\u201d\n \u201cYes you do. You said you and Dad helped build the barrier. Blew up part of the labyrinths there.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, that, yes.\u201d\n \u201cGather up your blowing-up stuff and meet me at the dock. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n A long silence ensued. Havi imagined Ivete wrestling between a desire to blow stuff up and the one to frustrate her big sister. Maybe there was a smidgen of helpfulness in there too, but Havi wasn\u2019t counting on that.\n \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be there. If you promise to stay.\u201d\n \u201cNo! Are you crazy? I have a career. I can\u2019t just ditch that and go back to fish farming.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, fine, then no help with explosives,\u201d Ivete said.\n \u201cI will stay a month.\u201d\n \u201cSix.\u201d\n \u201cTwo. Final offer.\u201d\n \u201cThree or it\u2019s no deal.\u201d\n Grinding her teeth, Havi promised three. Why did Ivete even want this if she was so angry at Havi?\n Havi turned the hover to swing by the family farm.\n Ivete was actually there, with several crates and bulging bags. And a girl Havi didn\u2019t know, who was briefly introduced as Ari, the girlfriend.\n The supplies were loaded and Havi raced off again, toward the barrier.\n \u201cWhat are we blowing up?\u201d Ivete asked.\n Havi grinned at her. \u201cYou\u2019re only asking that now? Who are you?\u201d\n \u201cNobody you know anymore.\u201d\n That stung. But maybe she was right.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry I stayed away so long, little sis.\u201d\n Ivete didn\u2019t react. Too little, too late?\n \u201cOkay, it\u2019s Osaka Barrier. It\u2019s obstructing the Paal defense system.\u201d Havi said.\n Ari cursed.\n Ivete said nothing for a while. \u201cWill it help against the Katabiotics?\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cMalala hub is breaking up as well, did you read that?\u201d Ari said. \u201cWho\u2019s gonna buy our fish now? If there\u2019s no hub . . . \u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that later.\u201d\n The boat skipped over the swarming fish backs in a straight line, illuminated only by the three moons. The fish weren\u2019t swimming in patterns here but teeming and churning chaotically. Havi tried to ride faster, but she was at maximum speed already.\n She swung the boat into a neat halt at one the barrier\u2019s floating connectors. \u201cWe have to hurry. The Katabiotics\u2019 effect could be here any moment. Do you know the weak points of the barrier?\u201d\n The girls shook their heads. Of course not. Why would they?\n Havi cracked her knuckles. She was information girl. \u201cYou girls get the charges set up while I find out where to put them.\u201d\n Apparently, lots of people wanted to blow up stuff. Or no. All the dates on the articles were like hundreds of years old. But it should be relatively easy to blow up the support structure to the deep but lightweight barriers that blocked off Continent Five\u2019s farm outlets.\n Havi walked up to where Ivete and her girlfriend were connecting detonators to packs of explosives. Ivete looked suspiciously adept at this. She probably had had a lot more practice than on the construction. Who was Ivete? Did Havi even know her? Why had Ivete blackmailed Havi into staying at the farm? Baffling.\n A tremor rocked the structure.\n \u201cWhat was that? Did you start already?\u201d\n Ivete looked spooked. \u201cNo. That was something else. Is it the aliens?\u201d\n What else could it be? Instinctively, Havi looked up at the moon. There was a black stripe across Green Cheese. What the hell? Suddenly it clicked. Not a stripe, but a chasm. Green Cheese was breaking up. Havi was no physicist, but she imagined a chunk of moon falling down would wreak immense havoc. Earthquakes. Tidal waves.\n \u201cWe have to hurry. This is the vulnerable spot. Even if the rest of the planet is safe, if this part breaks down, we\u2019re all doomed. We have to get those fish in here!\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re talking gibberish. I trusted you so far, but this is weird. What have fish got to do with alien attacks?\u201d\n \u201cA lot more than you\u2019d think. I\u2019ll explain later. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n \u201cIf we blow up the barriers, won\u2019t we kill a lot of fish?\u201d Ivete asked.\n Havi gestured to the millions of shiny fish backs swirling against the barriers. \u201cMaybe some, but these will rush in to take their place.\u201d\n The hover took off at speed.\n \u201cHow far?\u201d Ivete cried.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know! A couple of kilometers? Hurry.\u201d\n Ivete touched a secret button under the dash and the hover\u2019s speed tripled. Havi was pushed back against the seat, \u201cFar enough?\u201d\n The crack in the moon grew wider. Havi didn\u2019t dare wait any longer.\n \u201cGo! Set them off! Explode the stuff!\u201d she cried.\n Ari pressed the detonator with a big grin on her face.\n A series of bright sparks set off. An ear-shattering boom sounded. Seconds later, a big wave slammed them all against the hover\u2019s deck.\n \u201cJeezus,\u201d Havi groaned. \u201cEverybody all right?\u201d Everything hurt. Especially her ribs.\n Two separate groans answered her. At least they were alive. She managed to crack open an eye and found herself draped over the hover\u2019s steering wheel. Hadn\u2019t Ivete been driving?\n Once she\u2019d unpeeled herself from the dashboard, many of the pains lessened, but not the one in her ribs. She groaned. That made the pain worse.\n Had it worked? Had they set the fish free? She crawled to the hover\u2019s side and peered over the railing. Yes! The moonlight, strangely flat for this time of night, glinted off fish scales, orderly swimming in a micro version of the patterns that were only visible from orbit.\n Did this mean the planet was safe now? Havi could do nothing about Malala wormhole hub, but down here she\u2019d done all she could. She carefully rolled over on her back, landing on someone\u2019s belly or thigh, and checked out Glarus Moon. The crack was still there, but it hadn\u2019t grown any bigger. Maybe its internal gravity would pull it back together now that the outside influence was neutralized? She\u2019d hate to have her late nights without Green Cheese to complete the rainbow.\n She didn\u2019t know what to do about a moon that might still be falling apart. But she bet someone else would, now that it was plainly visible in the sky. No need for investigative reporting anymore.\n She moved her sore head to a softer spot on the other person\u2019s body.\n \u201cWatch it, sis. I\u2019m bruised there.\u201d\n Havi smiled.

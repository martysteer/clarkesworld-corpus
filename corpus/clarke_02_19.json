We held a two-day nomination period for the Clarkesworld Magazine Reader\u2019s Poll in January. Similar to last year, the shortened nomination phase appears to have minimized the attempts at ballot-stuffing without any significant impact on the total number of participants. It was a tight race in both categories and the top five changed many times. In the end, there were enough ties that both ended with six finalists instead of the normal five.\nFinalists for Best Story\n- \u201cDandelion\u201d by Elly Bangs (September)\n- \u201cThe Anchorite Wakes\u201d by R.S.A.

Go to:\nVoting will close on February 20th at 8PM EST and the results will be announced in our March issue.\nIn my October editorial, I talked about launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund the debut project from a new translation-focused publishing imprint\u2014Clarkesworld Books. After a few months delay\u2014for tax and accounting purposes\u2014the campaign started in late January. Our goal is to fund the first English language collection by Chinese author Xia Jia, A Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight and Other Stories. We\u2019ve published many of her stories in Clarkesworld and I couldn\u2019t be happier to have this be the first book for this imprint.\nYou can check out the campaign\u2014with links to several of her stories\u2014at Kickstarter:\nContinuing on the theme of translation, I have some exciting news. Clarkesworld has received a grant to translate and publish nine [LANGUAGE REDACTED] science fiction stories this year! This is a project that has been in some form of discussion for a long time now, but all the pieces finally started coming together in the last few months. (I haven\u2019t received the final copies of the paperwork yet, so I can\u2019t say who gave us the grant or what language we\u2019re translating from yet. Soon, I promise.)\nSince the process we developed for our ongoing Chinese SF project has worked so well, I\u2019m employing a similar model for this one. In January, I focused on adding people to the recommendation and translation teams we\u2019ll need to make this work. Story recommendations are already coming in and one translation is currently in-progress. We\u2019re hoping to have the first of these stories available for you in our April issue and continue monthly through the end of the year. After that, our initial funding will expire. It\u2019s a while off, but that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be thinking about as the year progresses.\nDublin 2019 has opened the nomination period for this year\u2019s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I\u2019d like to once again remind you that we haven\u2019t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org. At present, there isn\u2019t a category for professional magazines, but you can nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories.\nThe Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America has decided to honor me with a Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award. The award is \u201cgranted in recognition of the positive impact and influence the recipients and their work have had on the science fiction and fantasy genres.\u201d Past winners include people like Kate Wilhelm, Tom Doherty, Michael Whelan, James Tiptree, Jr., Octavia Butler, Carl Sagan, Terry Pratchett, Sheila Williams, and Gardner Dozois. That\u2019s an intimidating list to be added to. I\u2019ll receive the award at the Nebula Awards Conference in Los Angeles this May. My thanks to SFWA for this great honor.\nI suppose that\u2019s enough for one month, so I\u2019ll wrap things up here and thank you all for reading Clarkesworld and supporting this work we do.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

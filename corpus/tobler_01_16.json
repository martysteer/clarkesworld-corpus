Deep space shapes our eyes in ways unknown. Under this pressure, Europa is hazy, distant water plumes fogging the horizon, but closer too, and I think there is an undiscovered crevasse. We should be more mindful, but we soldier on, single file, metal cleats biting into the thin ice that covers Europa\u2019s salt ocean. Marius is already lost and though we walk toward Thrace Terminal, it has never seemed so distant. The second icecat seized up three days ago and no human has made this journey on foot.\nWe should be perfectly fine\u2014our suits were made for this world, heavy enough so that we will not struggle in the lesser gravity, thick enough to shield us from the radiation pouring from the sky. Beyond the haze, Jupiter churns in eternal storm. Before we left Thrace Terminal, we were mindful of the red spot, seeming to reemerge from having been swallowed\u2014but I cannot see it now, Jupiter\u2019s immensity hesitant to rise.\nIt used to bother me, the idea that we would be dead in a day without all the shielding we live behind. That radiation would squash us like bugs, but you get used to it. Space is hostile, my father used to say, but so too the ocean. We were not built for these spaces, so must change ourselves to enter them. It has always been so; history tells us this.\nA low vibration churns in my gut as I stab my cleat into the ice and push myself through another step. Endless miles of ice, the naked sky above us. I peek at that sky and my knees jelly at the sight of Galileo Station coming into view, framed against the vast milk-in-coffee expanse of Jupiter. The station\u2019s helium collection pods catch the distant sunlight and look like strands of spider web. They dance, but not in any wind. They plummet, into the clouds and gone, before returning with their precious cargo. The idea that the station is populated, that somehow people live within its walls, troubles my mind. Against the bulk of Jupiter, the station is no more than a pinprick, and if we living creatures fit within that pinprick\u2014\nI am made to feel small. Nausea punches a clammy hand into my throat. I try to swallow it down, because vomiting in a containment suit is no one\u2019s idea of a good time. The smell of my body is overwhelming, the silent admission that I escalated this endeavor, that Marius died, that they would send Kotto alone for us. Alone.\nIt is the idea of paperwork that calms my mind; paper is a thing of the past, of course\u2014it will be a series of cold keys and colder screens, making my fingertips chill with every swipe, but the idea of the work to come comforts, even if the idea of Kotto behind me does not. If you had to have anyone come after you, on a distant ice-clad moon where your partner had been\u2014swallowed, my mind whispers.\nTragically taken, I amend.\nKotto would not be anyone\u2019s first choice. Kotto knows walls and vehicles; she doesn\u2019t know sky and ice. She doesn\u2019t know the stories of these distant places the way I do.\nKOTTO\nThey say that after a while, you don\u2019t notice the cold.\nThe station is cold and Europa, being four hundred and eighty-five million fucking miles from the sun, is naturally and one-hundred percent organically, cold. You think you won\u2019t miss it\u2014that far away, you\u2019ll be locked up tight inside Thrace Terminal and too busy working. You\u2019ll be diving into a goddamn alien ocean\u2014what\u2019s to miss? All that warmth is what.\nYou don\u2019t dream about sex\u2014you dream about sunlight, about the way it looked falling through leaves, about the way it felt on your skin. They say you can\u2019t remember\u2014you were too young, born on Schiaparelli Station, shot toward Galileo as a teen, your family devoted to the deep; you\u2019ve only ever seen holos of trees you foolish, foolish girl, but you remember what that light looked like. Like fucking heaven.\nI talk about light a lot in my mental assessments. I\u2019m told that station-borns tend to have some trouble with natural light, or lack thereof. Something in our mind remembers it wasn\u2019t supposed to be all darkness and cold; something inside still hungers for what we\u2019ve never known. And Europa, despite being one of the brightest objects in the goddamn sky, isn\u2019t ever quite bright enough from the surface.\nShe\u2019s all silver and ice\u2014the Snow Queen, Marius called her\u2014but you know that means she\u2019s cold. Bolaji talks about the life that runs beneath her frozen surface, crackling in copper coils, and I thought at first he meant the ocean\u2014but he means the lineae, which look like bloodied shadows to me.\nThey meant to remove me from service once, given that my eyes cannot see the full color spectrum, but in the end decided that would be a waste, given my family\u2019s devotion to the deeps. Once you\u2019re out here, what else is there to do\u2014it\u2019s not like we\u2019re building entertainment complexes or schools. We aren\u2019t making cities\u2014though aren\u2019t we, every station is a city in miniature\u2014and there aren\u2019t exactly other jobs that need filling. This deep in, everyone\u2019s a garbage collector, a plumber, a chef.\nI\u2019d trained and advanced at the top of every class as if born to water, so it wasn\u2019t like they could kick me without consequence. There are a good many of us, but still not enough. Deep space science remains a sparse thing. Most people stayed where they were born, in the warm, sunshiny splendor of Earth. Fucking Earth. It\u2019s no more than a pinprick in the sky and I still crave it. Wonder what the oceans taste like. Wonder if I\u2019ll ever get there.\n\u201cHold.\u201d\nMy voice crackles out of my suit and ahead of me, Bolaji pauses in our trek. I draw alongside him, watching the plumes of vapor that haze the sky. Somewhere else, our helmets might dot with moisture, but here, the plumes fall as snow and ice\u2014it\u2019s too damn cold on the surface to stay liquid for long. But Bolaji\u2019s helmet is fogged and I lift a gloved hand, trying to wipe it away. It\u2019s on the inside\u2014he\u2019s breathing too hard and I wonder if he\u2019s got what Marius had, what we\u2019re trying to deny he had. Shrieking about the lost station\u2014he\u2019d found it, he\u2019d found it, but there was no lost station, we\u2019d know. Wouldn\u2019t we?\nPeople out there, it was said, they get sick and go mad because of the cold, because of the dark. You can\u2019t tell a person\u2019s gone mad, not until they melt down. But Bolaji\u2019s eyes are steady on me.\n\u201cGotta get Marius out of your head,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat happened happened, Bolaji\u2014you were good to go after him, but goddamn. Some people aren\u2019t made for this kind of place, even if they were born out here.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s something else in Bolaji\u2019s eyes even as he nods at me and agrees. There\u2019s something else and I don\u2019t press. What did he see that I couldn\u2019t see? There\u2019s no because. I just don\u2019t. I\u2019m fucking tired and we\u2019ll be sleeping another night on the ice and I\u2019m tired. So tired of the cold they said I would stop noticing. They never said when\u2014but they said I would.\nMARIUS\nOn the edge of the salt ocean, a growing limb of night\u2019s dark spreads and Marius can\u2019t make sense of it quickly enough. The ocean has no edge, no shore because the ice cap covers Europa entire. In turn, the ocean covers every bit of rocky ground. But here, there is a shore, an outcropping where Marius stands barefoot. The limb of darkness spreads like water through sand toward him.\n\u201cBolaji, can you see this?\u201d\nThere is no reply.\nMarius kneels upon the shore where it feels like mica, thin and flaking. He dips his hands into the darkness and recoils at the sudden warmth. He has not known such a sensation outside being tangled with another body. (He thinks of William, pushes the memory away\u2014that was another life, another planet.) The darkness creeps up his arms, to the elbow, to the shoulder. At that point, it feels as if a great maw has taken him in and the memory of cold is erased. This world was never cold, its ocean never solid.\nMarius watches the shore retreat at an alarming speed; the sparkling mica glints and is then gone as the salt ocean swells over his head. He thrashes, turning to look at what has a hold of him, but there is no face. Only clouded arms of ink, the limb of night having dissolved itself in the salt water.\nHe learned to swim as a child on Schiaparelli Station and took top placements. It would be different in an ocean, they said; a calm and controlled pool was not an ocean where one would encounter tides, currents, undertow. Pools did not contain living creatures. Any creature on Europa, should its ocean prove salty, would be called a halophile\u2014salt lover\u2014but Marius always remembered \u201chalo\u201d for angels.\nThe angel before Marius has a halo, and the deeper he is pulled, the more it glows in golden splendor. Oxygen deprivation can cause a mind to hallucinate, but Marius remains certain of what he sees before him. Certain, too, of the way his lungs have quieted, of the way he doesn\u2019t feel cold, because every synapse is shutting down.\nBOLAJI\nWhen Zeus abducted Europa, he came to her in the form of a striking white bull and she, in praise of his beauty, draped him with hand-woven garlands of flowers. Endless scent and color streamed from his grand horns and he reveled in the feel of her upon his back.\nEuropa, they would have you believe, so reveled in the feel of him beneath her, strong and sure and warmer than anything she had ever known, that she did not notice he was carrying her away from the shore, not until they were in the sea\u2019s wet, not until he had pulled her under and changed into a man more beautiful than any before him\u2014for of course, he was no man at all.\nThey say Europa did not scream (Marius screamed\u2014my people say a traveler to distant lands should make no enemies and this was not our intent\u2014never our intent), but by then, she was under water. How could anyone have known? The foam that rushed to shore could have easily been from her thrashing in the water, trying to escape Zeus\u2019s maniacal hold\u2014but it was only the gentle swelling tide, they say, carrying flower petals to shore in the wake of a beautiful wedding.\nEuropa\u2019s tides are well-concealed beneath a cap of ice, plumes of water escaping when they can. But once free, they freeze and become part of the ice forevermore. Europa stretches infinite before us. Ahead, I can see the curved ridges we will likely take shelter in if we mean to rest and hydrate. The Delphi Flexus is not endless, but looks such from where we walk; we have to cross its boundary, and then the penitentes\u2014the spikes of ice that prove this world is melting and refreezing in turn\u2014before Thrace Terminal becomes a possibility.\nI am torn between which is a more severe loss: Marius or the two icecats. Kotto would say the icecats, given our present circumstances. I am worried I would agree.\nWithin the flexus, we find a curve of ice in which to shelter. There will be no fire, but our suits are equipped with a series of chemical warming layers that should see us through. Likewise, there is a liquid feeding system, and though it is not my mother\u2019s moin moin, it will do. My mother told me the death that kills a man begins as an appetite, and perhaps this is what she meant, so when Kotto bids me eat, I activate the suit\u2019s feeding tube, tonguing once for water, twice for pureed food. There are two more meals to be had, which means at least two nights without. Possibly more. We will arrive at Thrace Terminal hungry.\n\u201cBolaji, what\u2014\u201d\nKotto grabs my arm and extends it away from my body. The soft suit is the only thing that separates us from certain death via cold or radiation, and by the soft light radiating from her helmet, I can see what she sees. The sleeve of my suit has torn, from elbow to wrist, the fabric gaping open as if the sleeve has been unbuttoned. Every layer is ripped, ruined, and something pale rests within.\nIt is so pale, I do not even recognize my own arm for my skin is not this color, but brown. I stare, for I have never seen such a thing\u2014has it been burned by cold? If my suit has been compromised, why have I not perished?\nKotto moves swiftly, cracking her case open to retrieve the emergency patch kit. I want to tell her to stop, but I sit silently, creamed spinach puree growing sour on my tongue. I should be dead. Why am I not dead? Kotto works fast\u2014her hands are sure as she seals the entire length of the sleeve back together. In the cold, frost begins to crackle over the binding.\n\u201cKotto.\u201d\n\u201cSssh.\u201d\nShe does not have to tell me twice.\nKOTTO\nThey say that in deep space, the extraordinary will become ordinary and eventually you stop noticing it. When the extraordinary is one\u2019s everyday job, it\u2019s nothing to fuss over. We live in space, we are settling the entire system, these acts are no longer magic. These people\u2014they need to stop talking, because they\u2019re so fucking wrong.\nBolaji\u2019s arm should not be that color\u2014it\u2019s like ice, Europan ice. But it\u2019s also not. If the lineae within Europa\u2019s ice look like shadows to me, charcoal lines hastily sketched, this ice is different, for his veins make a lineae of their own, these deep blue. Or, what I presume to be blue. I should not be able to see this color\u2014but here it is. I have never seen it, and yet I know it. An ancestral memory, my therapist would say. I want to ask Bolaji what color the lines are, but the suit needs to be sealed, and once it\u2019s sealed we say nothing.\n\u201cKotto.\u201d\n\u201cSssh.\u201d I lift my hand, as if I could place it over his mouth to silence him. But he stays silent. Trembling. His eyes are wide and I tell myself they are not getting pale, they are as brown as they ever were, calling to mind the blackwood jungles my grandmother left me paintings of. So deep one could get lost, until the sunlight pierced the trunks and\u2014oh Bolaji. What the hell? This was a simple rescue, nothing more.\nBeyond the goddamn color of his arm, Bolaji should be dead. I am certain this fact presses on him as much as on me. His suit was opened to space, to the Europan air which stands at nearly three hundred degrees below zero. Nothing can survive that. Not even the icecats proved able and they were built for it.\nBeneath my feet, the ice rumbles. Our training is so ingrained, I don\u2019t even have to say \u201cmove!\u201d before we\u2019re in motion. We know.\nAs stable as the surface should be, deep space remains largely unknown and hostile. Perhaps we were not meant to come this far\u2014we are too fragile, too alive to know the depth of this cold. Europa is only doing what Europa does best. Under the strain of Jupiter above her, carting her deeper into the stars, she cracks and groans and spews water from her belly. Most of this water falls to coat the ground in fresh ice; some escapes into space.\nBolaji and I climb up the flexus and slide down its backside, avoiding the spew of ice water. Despite the danger, I am grinning as we glide down the ice, over bumps and ridges as the crews on Mars often traverse the sand dunes. At the bottom of the ridge, our ice cleats stab us steady, though the ground rumbles still. High in the hazy sky, more water plumes.\n\u201cKotto\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBolaji, move,\u201d I say, because I want some distance between us and that plume. If we\u2019re resting at all (he should be dead, Bolaji should be dead), it\u2019s not going to be on top of Europa\u2019s vomiting mouth.\nMARIUS\nOthers have been on Europa for eons, so long that when they try to convey it in numbers and words, Marius is overwhelmed. Others believe he has a mind for science, but Marius can\u2019t digest what they transmit. Images flood his tear-blurred vision\u2014another star system, far from where he now floats. An explosion, a nebula, debris hurtling through space. These simple things, Marius slowly understands.\nMarius cannot understand his own star system in its infancy, but when he realizes that nine worlds are spinning into creation around a violently bright sun (he still counts Pluto), he can taste tears on my lips. He views the planets as children, small but growing larger, hauling in rock and gas, coalescing atmospheres tolerable and toxic, flinging comets here and moons there. He watches young Mars flood and old Mars perish; Valles Marineris cracks wide and he fears the entire planet will split in two, but she holds, dusty and dead.\nNo one has witnessed this, Marius thinks, though is quickly reminded by the strong body beneath his own that Others were here first. Others witnessed. This was theirs until slumber and gravity drew them into the depths where they slept, Marius and his kind cracked Europa\u2019s ice like an egg, pierced her salty ocean, drilled into her rocky mantle. (Crude, but he thinks of William again\u2014cracking, piercing, drilling.)\nMarius tries to speak, but is under water, and cannot understand how he is breathing, let alone how he might speak. He thinks he should not have left the station, but he had to, otherwise there would be no this. He was called to leave the station, knowing where to find them, knowing they had something to show him\u2014the lost station, the end of all he had sought. Bolaji should never have followed\u2014Marius is certain where the fault lies.\nHe stretches into the cold dark and when he can no longer see any brightness above, loses his sense of direction. Everything is featureless black, as if nothing has ever been created. In this black, there has never been a sun, nor any speck of light, until something startling and green darts through the salted water. Glowing Others murmurate across his vision, one sliding through Marius\u2019s palm small as a flower.\nThe beings draw so near that they swarm around Marius, against his skin\u2014skin, not suit, and he wonders when it was lost, and why he is not dead (is he dead?). When they swarm with more fury, his throat grows raw from screaming. He is not yet dead, he is not yet\u2014\nBOLAJI\nEuropa, once carried to Crete where she was to be queen, was welcomed by Asterion\u2014he of the labyrinth, the creature that was half man, half monster. Did Asterion challenge Zeus for Europa\u2019s fair hand? There are no such stories of what became of her there\u2014but for the one that my mind creates: that Europa, enraged after being taken from her home and life, turned on them both; that Athena looked down in her wisdom and recognizing a warrior soul, transformed what remained of the garland of flowers into a sword. Europa killed Zeus and imprisoned Asterion within the labyrinth, before tracing the path of spilled flowers back home.\nI am certain this did not happen, but it seems so, as Kotto jostles me into consciousness once more. She stands as fiery, sword-brandishing Europa above me, intent on slaughtering whatever obstacle lands in our path. I have never seen Kotto as such before and it steals my breath. Kotto keeps always to herself, intent on her work, on finding the smallest organisms that call Europa\u2019s oceans home. She cared nothing for humanity\u2014only what life might exist elsewhere. When she found the first, this was the only time I heard her laugh; she said they were yellow-orange, but they glowed green for me.\nMy tongue is numb in my mouth; I cannot answer her when she speaks, nor can I fully understand what she has said. She glows, as if she has become one of the salt-loving organisms of the deep. I nod and she seems pleased, vanishing from my sight. We move, but I am not walking. Kotto drags me on the emergency sledge. As if I have broken a leg. As if I am incapable.\nA look down at my legs tells me I am incapable. My suit has split wide again, exposing my legs to the air. At some point, it is clear that Kotto tried to seal the rends, but they split the binding again and again. I cannot fathom why; I do not feel larger, and my body is not shaped differently. But the skin that gleams up from the torn suit is wholly white, as clear as ice, with thousands of blue lineae running beneath.\nThis should startle me, but between the evidence and the emotion, there is a great gulf of nothing. One cannot reach the other. I study the legs as if they were Europan ice, following each lineae until I can no longer trace its path. They wind across the legs and disappear under, and I imagine I see patterns within them: sharp-edged stars and the lump that is Zuma Rock. I have only ever seen this rock in images handed down from lifetimes before my own: a gray and hulking lump rising quite suddenly from the trees as if it were dropped from space. My many-times-great grandfather was said to have climbed it; my many-times-great grandmother said that was absurd. And yet, here I am on Europa. I picture my many-times-great grandfather upon this rock and I am calmed.\nCome morning\u2014is it morning?\u2014the idea of the rock still rests within me. I feel it as if upon my tongue, salty and weighting it down so I cannot speak when Kotto looks at me. But I see it upon her face. Something else has happened, something she has no explanation for, and the following morning (the ice so very bright beneath Jupiter\u2019s glowing orb), she will have no explanation for what comes next.\nI want to speak to her; I want to write her a letter. My fingers crave the feel of keys, of a cold glass screen, so that I might tell her how Europa surely followed that trail of broken flowers home. So that I might tell her how Zuma Rock rises black from the greenery, and how my many-times-great grandfather stood upon it, barefoot, naked, the way I will stand upon the ice before the consumed shell of my body falls away.\nKOTTO\nOne man should not weigh so much in this gravity.\nThe sledge is ingenious, locking Bolaji firmly into place, so he is not jostled no matter the terrain we cover. The runners have blades, but like an ice skate possess something of a toe pick, which I can latch into the ice to keep the entire thing from moving. I do this now, kneeling on the ice as I try to catch my breath. We\u2019ll share our last meal in a few hours; tomorrow will be hungry, and Thrace Terminal is at least another day beyond. Water isn\u2019t a problem, at least; Europa\u2019s ocean water freezes clean, desalinated, and our suits are equipped with a sealed system that will allow me to store and melt ice for drinking.\nMarius should never have come out\u2014it\u2019s easy to convince myself of this. When Marius left the station, shrieking about finding a lost station (the lost station\u2014madness\u2014we had not been here before, had we), Bolaji, in his good nature, followed. No one went onto the ice alone\u2014ever, ever, ever. Going alone was certain death. Not that Marius cared or waited\u2014his discovery, he cried, would not wait. Of course he took an icecat. Of course Bolaji took another to follow. And now\u2014we were nearly fucked, but the universe had surely seen worse, even if we had not.\nI went alone, didn\u2019t I? Charged out after Bolaji without a second, without a third. Just went, and I shouldn\u2019t have. Was it worth two lives, Kotto? This goddamn lost station? What the hell does deep space do to a mind? What did Marius see that I did not?\n\u201cBolaji.\u201d\nHe\u2019s so still, the ice color having creeped up his cheeks. He tries to move his mouth, but cannot open it. His water tube remains tucked in the corner; he\u2019s unable to even tongue that away, which is probably best. A slow trickle is better than nothing. If I can get him back to Thrace Terminal, if we can get him in sickbay\u2014I don\u2019t know. Medicine isn\u2019t my thing\u2014first aid sure, but not this. And this isn\u2019t like anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\u201cCan you try to sit up?\u201d\nBolaji nods at me, but doesn\u2019t move. He should be able to sit up, only his legs secured to the sledge; his hands curl around the handles, but he could move them if he wanted. If he was able. I bite the inside of my cheek and taste salt. Maybe whatever\u2019s happened to him won\u2019t let him. Was this part of what happened to Marius?\nThe known part was Bolaji radioing back, shrieking that Marius had found it\u2014had found it and we were going to be famous and known and it was better than standing on Zuma Rock naked. Maybe this thing had a hold of him then, too. Was this what extreme cold did to a person? No; cold like this killed a person flat out. Why the hell wasn\u2019t Bolaji dead? Why weren\u2019t we all?\n\u201cNot sitting up is also fine.\u201d\nBolaji watches me like I\u2019m something he\u2019s never seen instead of someone he\u2019s worked with for seven years. He did a brief stint on Galileo Station, but his heart was never there. When I accused him of wanting a moon of his own, brand new ground he could sink his feet into, he joked that I always wanted an ocean no one had peed in. He wasn\u2019t entirely wrong.\n\u201cCome on. If you stop slowing me down, we can make the spikes, and that means . . . Thrace is still damn far away . . . \u201d\nThe sledge seems lighter when I pull it back into motion. When I dreamed of alien oceans, I dreamed of beasts big enough to pull crafts through them. Not our crafts\u2014their own. These beasts were never not industrious, crafting marvelous cities at the edge of every ocean they possessed\u2014and probably peed in.\nBut the beasts here are smaller and according to Bolaji, brighter, glowing green. What had Marius found that could compete with that? We\u2019d found life\u2014goddamn alien life\u2014and he was throwing himself out onto the ice for what. For this?\nI glance back at Bolaji, whose arms are raised, hands reaching for something I cannot see. Something he probably can\u2019t see, either. But what I see turns my stomach; the gloves of his suit are ripped. But more than that maybe, because the fabric looks eaten away. Something in the air, a contaminant we couldn\u2019t detect, something in the ice? The exposure to long, continued cold?\nThe penitentes rise like stalagmites from the ice field ahead. The thin blades of ice, some running dark with trapped minerals, are all turned the same direction, as if something has caught their attention. That something is the far-distant sun. I wonder what it would be like, to stretch under its warmth, to watch it melt this entire ball of ice into a whole, free-flowing ocean. Some worlds, I remind myself, are like that.\nI position the sledge within the shelter of two penitentes, and laugh at myself for doing so. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s someone out here to find us. It\u2019s not as if anyone else is looking. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll be in radio range of Thrace; tomorrow, they\u2019ll know. I draw on my feeding tube, food first, water second, and watch the sky until sleep claims me. I don\u2019t mean to sleep long\u2014Bolaji can\u2019t be left alone\u2014but four hours have passed by the time I look upon the Jupiter-bright sky again.\n\u201cIf you pick up the pace,\u201d I tell Bolaji, \u201cwe can cover some good ground here\u2014how\u2019s your water, anyhow?\u201d\nI pick my way to the side of the sledge, reaching for the controls on the arm of Bolaji\u2019s suit. His water level is too high\u2014he hasn\u2019t consumed any in the time we\u2019ve been traveling, and when I look at his helmet, I see why. Bolaji is gone. His suit flutters empty, but for a puddle of what looks like water.\nMARIUS\nAt this point, Europa\u2019s ocean is one hundred and eleven kilometers straight down, and Marius can see forever. The water swarms with life, hydrothermal vents spewing warmth into the ocean cold. Vast columns of bubbles stream upward, into the dark. Salt bursts across his tongue, but something beyond that, something metallic and true.\nHere, life abounds. Small, insistent. Larger, established. A cr\u00e8che of crabs cling to the hot chimneys, hearts fluttering beneath their transparent exoskeletons. Eels, worms, and Others, so many Others. They have been here a long time, have made nests and smoothed hollows in the Europan rock where the world is forever warm.\nOthers carry Marius over the crater and the crab-crusted remains of anchor points rising from the rocky ground. Marius recognizes the broken frame, the shattered drill. A lost station, the lost station\u2014but this lost station is Thrace Terminal, and the markings on the steel legs confirm it. He does not remember Thrace Terminal being lost, but can see it the way he has seen the past\u2014an explosion, a water-pale nebula, debris hurtling through the black salted sea. These simple things Marius understands.\nMarius and Others glide toward still-standing Thrace Terminal; the water tastes of metal, thermal vents scattering bubbles in their wake, broken petals that will perish before they reach the ice cap.\nBOLAJI\nEuropa followed flowers; I follow water.\nAll thoughts of the suit, of Kotto, of Marius, have gone; these came Before. They are not Now. Now and here, there is only the water, the salt having transformed my body into something Other. I spread through the water, following the currents created by the deep thermal vents\u2014even up here, beneath the ice, my body knows the way the water flows; can sense the warmth and cool entwined.\nIf there is purpose, it is only in growth. Why do we change? How do we endure? Why do we stretch for depths we have no hope of reaching? What happens when we do reach them? I think briefly of a man upon a rock, sweat-stained and aching. I think of how he must have looked at the land below him, at the froth of impossibly green trees, and this is how I survey the waters beneath me now. They are small, but filled with life.\nI travel as the water, pushing up through the ice clefts as I will, flinging myself into the sky which spreads clear and bright, before raining back to the ocean below. Pieces of me freeze on Europa\u2019s porcelain face, but I am more than these; I spread infinite, seven times as big as Earth\u2019s oceans, butting against the ice cap. Tonguing it into deeper water.\nKOTTO\nThrace Terminal stands black and skeletal against the ice. The distant sunlight gleams off the towers, off the ice that wraps her steel legs. She\u2019s still far off, but I breathe easier at seeing her familiar shape. If the extraordinary is supposed to become commonplace, then maybe the commonplace also becomes extraordinary, especially when we are forced from its confines. You don\u2019t dream about sex; you dream about familiar walls, your possessions no matter how meager, everyone you know.\nI flick my comms to life, already itching to get inside the station and take my helmet off. I want to breathe the stale, recycled air. I want to walk barefoot down the chilly corridors in morning. I want to attend my next goddamn mental assessment and show them I did it. I made it.\n\u201cKotto to Thrace Terminal.\u201d\nBut the sledge, folded back into the emergency pack at my back, weighs heavy. I made it back, but alone. I did it, but couldn\u2019t bring Bolaji with me. Couldn\u2019t pull Marius back from whatever cliff he\u2019d jumped off. Do you believe Bolaji had anything to do with Marius\u2019s condition? With his disappearance? They will ask, won\u2019t they? What will I answer? Bolaji did not make it, and Marius did not make it\u2014what can I say? The cold has frozen me to the core\u2014envy encases my heart and I cannot feel what perhaps I should for them, for the loss of them.\n\u201cThrace Terminal\u2014Kotto, fucking Christ.\u201d\n\u201cNot quite that.\u201d But I try to smile at the sound of Rey\u2019s voice\u2014something familiar, something warm. \u201cHave you in sight\u2014probably tomorrow, unless you send an icecat.\u201d I relay my coordinates and hear Rey dispatching a crew for me.\nMy steps quicken at the thought; my walk hastens to a run, but when my helmet clouds with breath, I slow. No sense in overdoing it, not if they\u2019re sending people for me.\nWhat did Marius and Bolaji find? What did they know? Why didn\u2019t you find it? Maybe you couldn\u2019t fucking see it, Kotto\u2014the changes in the ice, the changes in the water. Or did you find it and were simply unable to see the way Bolaji and Marius could?\nWhen the ground rumbles, I wonder at the speed at which they\u2019ve come. I strain to hear the icecats clawing their way cross the miles-thick ice, but they\u2019re still too far distant. The vibration through the ice is pervasive, and I track it, as if dancing.\nIf they say that eventually you don\u2019t notice the cold, must it also come to pass that after a while, you grow so accustomed to the world you inhabit, you forget it\u2019s hostile? You forget that a rumble isn\u2019t always a transplanted icecat; sometimes, it\u2019s the native ice-buried ocean you\u2019ve come to study. Sometimes, it\u2019s a plume of water and vapor erupting from a fissure in the ice. A plume of water that seems to enfold you like an arm, like a garland of flowers, drawing you toward the arctic waters.\nI tumble and when I at last come to rest against a gently curved flexus, I\u2019m breathing hard. The world beyond my helmet is hazy, but I can see the tear in my sleeve. Elbow to wrist, my arm gone to Europan ice. Deep blue lineae trace a new map to new lands upon me. Europa swims gray and I think it\u2019s the condensation of breath on my helmet\u2014but it\u2019s something else.\nI have forgotten the cold.\nEverything blurs."}

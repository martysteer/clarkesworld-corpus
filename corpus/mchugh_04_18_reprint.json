Her head crest, flattened now, is white, banded with orange. Her eyes are red-shot yellow, horizontally slit. When she smiles, her teeth are noticeably stained. Meychezhek acquired an addiction to coffee during her times as an ambassador on Friendship and Perunu-Zambezi.\nThe smile is a human expression, meant to put me at ease, but her fangs are intimidating.\nI bow\u2014correctly, I hope\u2014and she kneels.\nKrithkinee don\u2019t sit. They bend in the same places as humans but the proportions are different. Shin bones shorter, feet longer\u2014pivots for burst sprinting. The extra pair of arms raises the center of gravity. The body leans forward, balanced by the short tail. Feet and fighting arms have triple talons, one opposed. The four fingers of the inner manipulative arms have retractable claws.\nMeychezhek signals for me to be at ease and I relax my pose fractionally. My pulse races.\n\u201cThank you, Dhar, for welcoming me into your home.\u201d My Babel implant turns Euraf English into crude but passable Junkhin before the words reach my mouth. It never stops being disconcerting, to speak a language you don\u2019t fluently understand, nor the sense of your muscles moving contrary to the brain\u2019s commands.\n\u201cYou are honored,\u201d Meychezhek replies, accepting what is due to her rank. A dhar is part military officer, part civil administrator, and part feudal lord\u2014a Japanese daimyo in the era of the shoguns, combined with an Indian civil service mandarin.\nOur solicitation of an invitation to trade had followed the correct form: approaching the provincial dhar with an appropriately personalized gift, in this case, an antique coffee set, unsuitable for krithkinee mouths but Meychezhek is a collector. Given the modest scale of our enterprise, we\u2019d expected her to defer to a subordinate lord. A further round of gifts would follow, and possibly a second deferral, depending on the status of the lower ranked lord, the social and commercial advantage for them, and the particulars of their patronage relationship with Meychezhek.\nWhat we didn\u2019t anticipate was that the dhar would accede directly to the solicitation and offer to host me herself.\n\u201cThe commendations from your peers are impressive,\u201d Meychezhek says. \u201cYou are highly esteemed.\u201d\nAgain, there\u2019s the disconcerting awareness that the words my ears hear aren\u2019t the same as those my brain receives. If I concentrate, I can hear both.\nMeychezhek\u2019s statement is both a compliment and a challenge. I\u2019m confused, though. \u201cForgive me, Dhar. The commendations of my peers?\u201d\n\u201cAt the university.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . \u201d I haven\u2019t studied or worked at university in a decade. I\u2019m surprised enough that it\u2019s an effort to avert my gaze. Staring is more than just rude among krithkinee. A person of equal or inferior rank holding another\u2019s gaze may be seen as a challenge to fight.\n\u201cI have not conversed with a fellow sapientologist since I returned from Perunu-Zambezi,\u201d she continues.\nMy thoughts blank for an instant, then race. The dhar\u2019s interest is personal: in me. This is both better and worse than we\u2019d assumed. Better, because the mercantile stakes aren\u2019t so high as we feared\u2014it seems the dhar\u2019s intent is not to levy any uncomfortable political demands. Worse, because it means that the success or failure of our enterprise weighs far more heavily on Meychezhek\u2019s impression of me, personally, than I\u2019d anticipated.\n\u201cIt will be your pleasure to converse with me,\u201d she says.\nI\u2019m expected to join Meychezhek for the morning meal. Badhar-krithkinee traditionally break fast at dawn. The dark-crested, orange-skinned junkhar house attendant allowed that it was proper for me to complete my morning prayers first, but it means that the dhar\u2019s been waiting for me, now, and I\u2019m half-jogging to keep up with the attendant\u2019s loping stride.\nKrithkinee are carnivores. Among high status badharee and junkharee it\u2019s usual to eat whole animals, roasted, baked, or cured. Offal and pickled meats are common foods among the lower social classes. Raw fruits and vegetables are eaten as a garnish and digestive aid.\nI don\u2019t try to hide my surprise and delight to see the piled plate of leaves and fruit\u2014many of which I even recognize.\nMeychezhek raises her long chin to expose her throat. I immediately dip my head, pressing my chin to my collarbone in the appropriate response.\nShe\u2019s not alone. Her third and favorite son, Pathkemey is also with her, as is Yzgushin, the junior-most of Meychezhek\u2019s wives, currently heavily pregnant and nursing an enormously round belly.\nPathkemey, the \u201cson,\u201d is female, as is Meychezhek, \u201cfather\u201d and \u201chusband.\u201d Yzgushin, \u201cwife,\u201d is male.\nKrithkinee social gender roles align rigidly with the physiological reproductive functions of impregnator and impregnated, and along comparable lines to those found in human traditions of patriarchy, but the actual biological sexes are inverse to the human norm. Evidently the providers of my Babel\u2019s Euraf-Junkhin thesaurus were ideological pedants of similar stripe to my old professor of comparative sociology\u2014equating gendered social roles to their human patriarchal approximates, but aligning gendered pronouns to biological sex.\nIt means I have to be infuriatingly careful how I think, so that I\u2019m not\u2014one way or other\u2014constantly addressing people as the wrong gender.\nYzgushin is dwarfed by his husband and stepson. His fighting arms are tucked discretely into the folds of his frock, as is appropriate for a wife. He dips his chin as I do.\nPathkemey casts a glance at Meychezhek, evidently unsure of my status relative to hers. After a brief hesitation, she raises her chin as her father has.\nFormalities completed, I\u2019m invited to kneel at the table. Meychezhek serves\u2014her wife first, then Pathkemey, and then me.\nThe balcony, on the exterior of the house\u2019s uppermost story, affords a view over the city. The squat, drum-shaped towers of manor houses, manufactories and communal tenements rise out of the bustle below, of traffic-packed roads winding between garden plots, orchards, animal pens, and tented markets. Elevated railways connect many of the towers.\nI\u2019m offered a middle leg from the roasted creature on the central platter. All six of its feet have opposed thumbs. They look like children\u2019s hands. The little carcass reminds me of the xenophobic slur that krithkinee eat their own young. I fill up the rest of my plate with salad.\n\u201cCurious, is it not?\u201d Meychezhek says. \u201cI expose my weakest point to demonstrate that I am unthreatened by you. Among krithkinee the convention is so deeply ingrained as to be hardwired. Yet you are an alien, bound to different conventions. In my instinctive show of strength, I expose myself to unintended risk.\u201d\nPathkemey\u2019s expression of alarm transcends species boundaries. Had she made a mistake in exposing her throat to me? Yzgushin observes with frank curiosity.\nI say, \u201cYou do not perceive me as a threat.\u201d\n\u201cNo, but my interpretation of your human signals could be flawed.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe so?\u201d\nMeychezhek flashes her fangs in another of those human grins. I have a sudden suspicion that she knows the expression is intimidating and is being mischievous. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you sense from me?\u201d\nMeychezhek picks at her meat with the claws of her inner arms. Badharee of the dominant culture eschew cutlery. There are bowls of scented water on the table for washing between courses.\n\u201cConsciously, you are excited and curious. Nervous, perhaps. It is in your gestures and the movement of your eyes. But your body is reacting like prey. The smell is so strong I can taste it.\u201d\nI\u2019d put the butterflies in my stomach down to my queasiness that a provincial dhar had taken a personal interest in me. It\u2019s more than that, though. The monkey in my hindbrain is barely holding itself together. \u201cYou are right. I am afraid of you.\u201d\nPathkemey is affronted. \u201cWhy? We offer no threat. You are a welcome guest in the house of my father.\u201d\nMeychezhek holds up a hand to stay her.\nIs she testing me, or Pathkemey? Or seeking to educate her son? Pathkemey didn\u2019t accompany her father on her ambassadorial postings. Her exposure to non-krithkinee can have been minimal, at best. Is this the real reason why Meychezhek chose to invite me herself? To be a sample specimen, capable of educated conversation?\nI pick up the spouted cup beside my place and take a sip of water, trying to think like an academic. \u201cHumans have mixed instincts,\u201d I say. \u201cWe evolved as prey until our intelligence developed to the point that we could turn the tables on our hunters. Since then, we have grown accustomed to being at the top of the food chain. But the hunted monkey is still in there.\u201d It occurs to me, belatedly, that they\u2019re unlikely to know what a monkey is, since badharee tend to eschew encyclopedic implants. I indicate the dismembered beast on the table, which seems near enough. \u201cIn you, I see a predator, stronger than I am, and in your element.\u201d\nPathkemey says, \u201cLike hunting near mhaharrtee.\u201d\nA mhaharrt is a keystone predator in the primary terrestrial ecosystem that the badharee-junkharee export to their terraformed colonies. Mhaharrtee have a reputation for ignoring smaller predators, such as krithkinee\u2014but not always.\nMeychezhek raises her crest, acknowledging her son\u2019s astuteness. \u201cHumans have a superficially similar idiom\u2014\u2018like swimming with sharks,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut krithkinee are not \u2018hunted monkeys,\u2019 as you say.\u201d She flicks a finger towards my plate. \u201cYou are enjoying your meat.\u201d It is not a question.\nI\u2019m yet to touch it. I pick up the little infant arm and, copying Pathkemey, sink my teeth into the roasted flesh. \u201cI am. It is delicious.\u201d\nMeychezhek has given me into Pathkemey\u2019s keeping to learn to ride a staigeg, alongside a group of the household\u2019s children. The lessons take place in the manor house\u2019s central courtyard. Members of the household look down at us from the curved interior balconies.\nThe children\u2014with no more riding experience than I\u2014hurl themselves up onto the staigegee with absolute recklessness and are tossed aside nearly as quickly. They take little if any heed of Pathkemey\u2019s instruction and cheer the most spectacular falls, congratulating each other on their bruises.\nI ask Pathkemey if their heedlessness disturbs her.\nShe considers silently for several seconds before answering. \u201cThey are children. This is the way children should behave. When they tire of falling off, they will become heedful of my words.\u201d\n\u201cAre you not concerned for their safety?\u201d\nAgain the pause\u2014Pathkemey is as intelligent as her father, but weighs her words more slowly. \u201cYes. But it is a father\u2019s unreasoning protectiveness.\u201d She points out two of the children as being her own son and daughter. \u201cChildren are the wealth and joy of our house. The loss of a child is cause for grief. But see the joy that they find in this game. There is joy in this too for me.\u201d\nNeedless to say, neither she nor the children can understand my own caution when approaching my designated staigeg.\n\u201cThere will be war between humans and krithkinee,\u201d Meychezhek says. \u201cSooner, rather than later.\u201d\nShe has finally consented to escort me to the botanists with whom I\u2019m hoping to negotiate the supply of pharmaceutical ingredients. I look down at Meychezhek from my sedan, perched high up on the hump of my staigeg. My riding is not yet proficient enough to control a staigeg on the city\u2019s crowded streets. Consequently I find myself carted about like some frail and revered grandmother or religious sage. Meychezhek sits at the base of her mount\u2019s neck, as does the badhar mahout who steers my beast. The blue-black skins and striped white crests of the badharee stand out starkly among the orange, scarlet, and crimson faces and dark spines of the majority junkharee.\n\u201cThere has already been war,\u201d I say, \u201cMore than once. The Edoans and Austronese have fought the Reformationist junkharhee at Autaki. The League has fought beside the dzaiiree-rajhinee . . . \u201d\nMeychezhek makes a sharp upward chopping gesture of one outer arm\u2014silence.\n\u201cSkirmishes,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean a war that will encompass our two species. Total war.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d It seems unlikely to me. Humans and krithkinee both have too much enthusiasm for intraspecies warfare to ever gang up on anyone else.\n\u201cBecause neither of us learned not to hate before we climbed into space,\u201d Meychezhek says.\nMy staigeg stops suddenly to avoid crushing a crowd of junkharee street children. I have to grab at the wooden case on my lap to stop it sliding off\u2014full of coffee berries for propagation, my gift to the botanists. The mahout swears while guards jump off their wheeled sleds to shoo the urchins out from under the feet of the staigegee.\n\u201cRelations between the major human polities and the Empire have always been good,\u201d I say.\nMeychezhek shows an expression that I\u2019m unsure how to interpret. \u201cFor how long? Badharee are a minority. We have held this Empire for thirty generations. But the Empire belongs to the junkharhee\u2014they are the majority. The Reformationists nibble at our borders. Every year our rule becomes more overt, the krithzha more obviously our puppet, and more junkhar lords go over. The tighter we grip, the less we hold.\u201d\n\u201cYou think the Reformationist junkharhee will take over the Empire?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen there will be war between krithkinee and krithkinee.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be that,\u201d she agrees. \u201cBut it will be limited. Neither side can afford not to find an accommodation. And then there will be war between krithkinee and humans.\u201d\nI\u2019m not sure if she\u2019s treating the badharee-junkharee Empire as synonymous with the krithkinee species, or expects that the lesser krithkinee polities will somehow fall in behind the Empire in the case of a major war with humankind. \u201cDo you hate?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI hate the dzaiiree and rajhinee and their unclean interbreeding and their alhothma.\u201d\nMy Babel can\u2019t provide a sensible translation of \u2018alhothma.\u2019 I stay with the topic at hand. \u201cBut not the Reformationists?\u201d\nShe shakes her chin from side to side, as a horse would, imitating the human gesture to ensure my understanding. \u201cNo. They are my enemies, but their actions are sensible to me.\u201d\n\u201cDo you hate humans?\u201d\n\u201cI will learn easily enough,\u201d she says. \u201cMy point is that we both have a concept of hate. Other species do not. Bnebene have evolved beyond such things. Pa\u2019or know only acquisitiveness. Jaendreil know only fear and the courage of conquering it. Other species go to war because they are driven to it. Humans and krithkinee go to war because hate makes it a choice.\u201d She makes the chopping gesture with her fighting hand. \u201cBut this is all in the future. Today our interests are in alignment.\u201d\nShe picks up that thread of conversation on the ride back to the manor. \u201cIt is a peculiarity of humans that you weaken yourselves voluntarily.\u201d\nI\u2019m in good humor after my successful meeting with the botanists. Meychezhek told them that they were pleased by my gift and, if my grasp of krithkinee nonverbal cues is sound, it did indeed seem to be the case.\n\u201cHow so?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cBecause you accommodate yourself to your weakest member. You devote resources to ensure the survival of individuals who would not otherwise live. This weakens your species.\u201d\n\u201cThat is evolved social behavior,\u201d I say. \u201cFrailty is not synonymous with lack of social value.\u201d\nShe chops with her hand. \u201cNo. It is counter to natural behavior. A pack runs at the pace of its second weakest member. The weakest falls behind, and the pack becomes stronger. This is the krithkinee way.\u201d\nShe pushes her lower jaw forward, ruminating. At length, she continues, \u201cIt is widely known that humans permit the survival of alhothmanee, as the dzaiiree-rajhinee do. I would dismiss it as a slander, if I had not seen for myself that it is true.\u201d\nThe translation that my Babel provides for \u2018alhothmanee\u2019 doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cDivided souls?\u201d\nShe nods, and suddenly I see that Meychezhek is intensely uncomfortable. \u201cThe sharing of a womb by multiple offspring,\u201d she says. Her lips peel back from her teeth in an expression that seems a direct analog for a human grimace of disgust. \u201cAllowing such offspring to survive.\u201d\n\u201cMultiple births are not allowed to survive?\u201d\n\u201cOnly one,\u201d she says.\nThere\u2019s a parable, of which there are several versions across the various badharee and junkharee cultures. It tells of twin siblings who, by the madness and deception of their birth mother, were both permitted to live. The son was raised as the heir of her father, a provincial dhar. The daughter, hidden by his mother and fostered to a childless noble house, was trained to become a lord\u2019s wife.\nThe fortunes of both houses\u2014birth and adoptive\u2014were dogged by ill luck, which escalated to provincial catastrophe when the son inherited her father\u2019s title and was subsequently, unwittingly, married to her sister. Only when he was dying of plague did their mother confess to his crime. The sister-wife promptly committed suicide, so that his brother-husband\u2019s fortunes could be restored. By this act of sacrifice, the soul that had been shared by the twins was made whole and the fortunes of the dhar\u2019s house and province restored.\nThe story serves both as justification of racial bigotry and reinforcement of male subservience. Twins are rare among krithkinee and contemporary medical science allows for the selective abortion of early-term fetuses. Only among the most traditionally-minded badharee and junkharee is abortion of alhothmanee still applied\u2014to borrow the dry if distasteful descriptor of one ethnographer\u2014\u201cpostnatally.\u201d\nI stay to talk with Pathkemey after my next riding lesson, while the children try to lead the recalcitrant staigegee back to the stables.\n\u201cYour father thinks there will be a great war between our species,\u201d I say, in response to a comment of hers about future trade.\n\u201cShe is wise, my father,\u201d Pathkemey replies, her eyes on the children.\n\u201cDo you fear it, too?\u201d\nShe stiffens, then rounds on me as if she can\u2019t believe what I\u2019ve just asked. Her chin comes up and her head crest rises.\nFor a terrifying moment, I\u2019m certain she\u2019s going to assault me, and my only thought is to pray to God that I\u2019ll survive it. I can\u2019t even begin to muster the words to apologize. The children huddle together, looking from Pathkemey to me. Without another word, she turns and strides away.\nWith her, I\u2019m certain, go my prospects here. I start to shake. I feel like a lion just looked me in the eye, enraged, and then walked away.\nThe staigegee, forgotten, have ambled along the passageway to the manor\u2019s front gate. A guard shouts in surprise and the children scatter.\nStaigeg saddles are designed to accommodate krithkinee tails, and therefore slope down at the back. No matter how I adjust my posture, my round human backside keeps sliding off.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m struggling to concentrate, terrified as I am that, with one ill-conceived question, I\u2019ve irretrievably misstepped, wrecked my prospects of closing this trade deal, and\u2014God forbid\u2014put myself in danger of physical harm. That Pathkemey has rebuffed my attempts to apologize and Meychezhek hasn\u2019t had time for me, until today\u2019s curt instruction to accompany her, has done nothing to allay my fears.\nMy staigeg responds to my fidgeting by veering into the path of the guard riding beside me.\nThe staigegee grunt at each other and bump their ugly heads until I get mine walking in a straight line again, apologizing profusely to the other rider.\nThe guard\u2014a junkhar\u2014stares at me, unsure how to respond. Like many krithkinee I\u2019ve encountered, she cannot quite decide what my status is: whether she should treat me as a male, and therefore beneath her; or as an impregnator, and therefore her equal, or even superior.\nMeychezhek, having ignored me since we set out, chooses this moment to drop back. \u201cYou offended Pathkemey.\u201d\nI begin to stammer an apology, but she waves me to silence. \u201cFear is a reaction of prey. It is something that happens to other beings. Not to krithkinee. As I have explained.\u201d\nI\u2019d realized my mistake after I watched Pathkemey march away from me. The only Junkhin word for fear\u2014the word my Babel used\u2014means specifically \u2018hunted feeling.\u2019 Relief floods me. Meychezhek doesn\u2019t look or sound angry.\nMy words come in a rush, \u201cWhen I spoke to Pathkemey, I was thinking about your comments that there will be war between our species, and that we will learn to hate each other.\u201d\n\u201cYou will be pleased to explain,\u201d she says.\nAnd then I realize: every one of her retainers has eyes or ears turned our way. They\u2019re completely attuned to her, even when their attention is ostensibly on clearing a path through the traffic. My stomach knots all over again.\n\u201cI think,\u201d I say, slowly, \u201cthat our concepts of hate differ. For humans, hate derives mainly from fear.\u201d\nMeychezhek relaxes, the scholar in her reengaging. The guards follow suit. \u201cCurious,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hatred that a krithkinee will feel for humans or jaendreil or pa\u2019or is different to this.\u201d She thinks for a few moments. \u201cIf a weak krithkin attacks the exposed throat of a strong krithkin it causes a sense of shock in the attacked individual. This shock triggers fury at the effrontery of the weaker individual. That lesser species will contend with us\u2014even defeat us, on occasion\u2014prompts the same response in many krithkinee.\u201d\nI wonder if there are silent quotation marks around the term \u201clesser species.\u201d\n\u201cYou think that other species are weaker than krithkinee?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says. \u201cAs we have discussed.\u201d\nA commotion erupts on the balcony outside my chamber while I\u2019m rolling my mat after evening prayer\u2014several voices talking over each other in Junkhin too rapid for my Babel to catch more than snatches.\nI gather that something is happening with Yzgushin and his baby. I open my door in time to see Meychezhek stride past. Pathkemey stops me.\n\u201cYou will prefer to remain in your room.\u201d\nI\u2019m not at all certain that Pathkemey has forgiven me for inadvertently accusing her of cowardice. \u201cIs everything well with Yzgushin?\u201d\n\u201cHe is giving birth,\u201d she says, shortly, and hurries after her father.\nI remain in the doorway, neither quite willing to return to my chamber nor daring enough to leave it. Servants dash across the courtyard, heading towards the garages. I hear the faint whine of electric motors, fading quickly as the sleds pass out through the front gate.\nIt\u2019s quiet from Yzgushin\u2019s chamber, around the curve of the balcony. Other members of the household clump together along the balconies, above and below. In the courtyard, guards spread around the perimeter. I wonder why.\nPresently, there are sounds from the gate. A group enters the courtyard\u2014a junkhar lord and her guards. I retreat further into the shadows of the doorway. More retinues follow the first, badharee and junkharee, lesser lords who owe patronage to Meychezhek. The guards jostle as they make space for their masters, but there\u2019s no fighting and the crowd remains quiet. The house lights come on as the sun sets.\nA thin cry breaches the dusk. It sounds like the croak of some baby bird, nothing like a human infant.\nThen a second cry joins the first.\nThe click of the bolt on Yzgushin\u2019s door makes me jump. Pathkemey emerges and stands to one side. Her father follows, one infant voice growing louder as she does.\nMeychezhek moves to the balcony rail and holds up the baby in her hands. Tiny limbs flail. The legs and fighting arms don\u2019t have their claws yet. The child\u2019s mouth is open wide, its eyes tight shut. Its voice fills the hollow core of the manor house. The other baby, left with its mother, has quieted.\nAlhothman.\nI think, for a disbelieving moment, that Meychezhek will simply cast the child down into the courtyard. The watchers seem to hold their breaths. Meychezhek turns the baby over in her hands, leans her head down, and bites the back of its neck. Its cries cease, abruptly. When she lifts up her face, her mouth is bloody.\nThere\u2019s a murmur of approval from the courtyard\u2014from the junkharee. The badharee lords are stiff-faced.\nMy stomach heaves. The lords bow their heads, touching their chins to their chests before they begin to file out. Meychezhek raises her gaze. Her eyes catch the light as she spies me in my doorway.\nBile rises. I turn and flee.\nShe seeks me out before dawn. One of the servants must have reported me packing. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s come to my chamber, rather than calling me to attend her.\n\u201cYou have found your reason to hate.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d For a second, I can see nothing in her but an animal that killed its own offspring\u2014killed, like an animal, with its own teeth. My gorge rises again and I need a moment to compose myself. \u201cMy own kind . . . \u201d I\u2019d been about to say \u201ccommit such atrocities.\u201d I change it to, \u201cMy own kind do comparable things.\u201d\n\u201cAnd do you hate those that do?\u201d\nI\u2019m terrified that I\u2019ll lose the last of my self-control, that I\u2019ll insult her beyond toleration, like a monkey flailing defiance at a panther. \u201cWhy that way?\u201d I manage. \u201cWhy not in the womb, early?\u201d\n\u201cI am Dhar, and badharee,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had to be seen.\u201d\n\u201cYour own child. How could you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was for my child. The alhothman had to be ended so that my child\u2019s soul could be made whole. For my people, too, and the Empire. Because I am Dhar, and badharee.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I told you that I am a twin, would you \u2018end\u2019 me?\u201d\n\u201cYour alhothma would not be for me to repair. You would have to leave my house and no trade would be possible with you or your combine.\u201d Her tone is patient, like Pathkemey\u2019s during riding lessons. The notion that she\u2019s being tolerant of me is unbearable.\nI draw myself up. \u201cI thank you for the hospitality of your house, Dhar. I regret that I must leave.\u201d\n\u201cYou have concluded your business?\u201d\nShe knows very well that I have nothing remotely resembling a contract for trade with the botanists. \u201cSufficiently well,\u201d I say.\nShe remains where she is for several seconds longer, her gaze holding me.\nI see disappointment there, and I feel like a fool. I know I can\u2019t tolerate, can\u2019t abide, what I\u2019ve witnessed, and yet, still, her tolerance makes me feel like a fool.\nMeychezhek lifts her chin and is gone.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, January 2016.\nIan McHugh's first success as a fiction writer was winning the short story contest at the national science fiction convention in his native Australia in 2004.

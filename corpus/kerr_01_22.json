It drifts over me, hazy in the way sound gets distorted over distance.\n Gentle, and I think he must be lying down as well, half asleep with his eyes almost closed. A little breathy, as if everything he says is spoken on exhalation. \u201cYou sound sad. Is everything okay?\u201d\n \u201cNo. I mean, yeah. I mean. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\n I wish I could feel his breath. I imagine its warmth on my skin. \u201cGood. What\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d I roll onto my side, press my hand against the glass. \u201cNothing. Looking at the stars again.\u201d\n \u201cOh yeah?\u201d I can hear his smile. \u201cI bet they\u2019re the same ones I\u2019m looking at.\u201d\n I trace my fingers over the constellations. \u201cI see Leo. And Virgo.\u201d\n \u201cThe lion and the virgin.\u201d\n I snicker, soft into the dark mattress beneath me. \u201cThat seems like it should be symbolic of something.\u201d\n \u201cOh? Does it?\u201d\n I smile, like I imagine him smiling. \u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cIf you figure it out, let me know.\u201d\n \u201cAlways.\u201d\n I drop into silence, and so does he. I imagine him lying there, content to wait for me, content to simply have me feel near. I breathe deep, let it out slow.\n \u201cYou sound sad.\u201d\n \u201cEsteban.\u201d I stop him before he can ask again.\n \u201cYes?\u201d\n \u201cI want to hear you say my name.\u201d\n \u201cAnna.\u201d\n I want to cry at that simple sound, but I don\u2019t. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d\n \u201cI love you, Anna.\u201d He doesn\u2019t hesitate, no matter how sleepy he sounds. He never does.\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n \u201cAnything for you.\u201d\n \u201cGoodnight.\u201d\n \u201cNight.\u201d\n I press the end button next to the speaker. The bed is narrow, wedged into an alcove against the window that spans its length. When I move closer to the glass, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m outside, among the darkness and the stars, the colors of the galaxy, and I can drift into the universe.\n I watch those lights, the stars that are supposed to give passage to safe harbor.\n They are empty, too far away to touch. I roll over onto my other side.\n The room is small and dark to save energy. A few dim lights shine here, too, green and blue buttons of too much importance for them to respond to my touch. Warning labels glow with red text that matches the bold, threatening light above the airlock. A handful of monitors lie blank and dormant.\n There are rooms beyond, equally small. A bathroom, a kitchen. A room with a treadmill and a handful of weights.\n My alcove has not quite enough room to sit upright within it, and I shift to lie upon my back. Built into the low ceiling above me is a screen, and I tap it into life. Black, with white text, and I scroll through a handful of names. I stop, go back up to Henry.\n Henry invigorates me the most.\n I press his name, and the screen blinks a call sign twice. Then the sound of an open line.\n He\u2019s kind, a little deep. Energized, and I think I must have caught him prepping for a workout. \u201cHey sweet cheeks. How\u2019re you doing?\u201d\n \u201cBetter now, thanks. What are you up to?\u201d\n \u201cThe usual. You?\u201d\n \u201cLying here. Nothing, really.\u201d\n I can almost see him shake his head at me. \u201cNothing? You should do something.\u201d\n \u201cLike what?\u201d\n \u201cHave you gone for a run lately?\u201d\n I swallow a sigh. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe you just need to get your blood pumping. I\u2019ll run with you.\u201d\n I don\u2019t want to run. I never do. Still, I pull myself from the alcove and move through the left doorway on the far side of the room. My eyes know the darkness, the shapes made by the lights of the safety guide set into the wall.\n I slip into a pair of shoes and transfer Henry to me via a button on the treadmill\u2019s monitor.\n \u201cYou there?\u201d\n \u201cYou know it, sweet cheeks. How far you think you can go today?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. Guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d I step onto the machine and start to move, a walk at first, and then I switch into a jog, until I feel my heart speed up with the rhythm.\n \u201cThat\u2019s it, listen to that breathing. In and out.\u201d\n I say nothing to him, knowing from experience that as soon as I start talking, I\u2019ll lose that breath that I need to run.\n Henry\u2019s encouragement comes anyway. \u201cFeel those endorphins release. Mind and body. A good run can cure anything.\u201d\n He\u2019s always so damned encouraging.\n I stop at once. My feet are carried out from under me, and I gasp and grip the handrails. The treadmill turns off on its own.\n \u201cHey, hey, sweet cheeks. Are you all right?\u201d\n \u201cFine.\u201d The word spills out too fast.\n \u201cNo injuries?\u201d\n \u201cNo, Henry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n A pause. His voice is concerned beneath his insistence. \u201cYou should keep going. It\u2019s important to work up a sweat, sweet cheeks.\u201d\n I don\u2019t continue. I rub my hand across my dry forehead. \u201cWhy do you always have to call me that?\u201d\n Perky again, and he misses my anger. \u201cYou asked me to. What should I call you instead?\u201d\n \u201cAnna. Just Anna.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Anna. Did you want to start running again?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d I drop my hand down on the cancel call button.\n Back to bed. Always back to bed. There is nowhere else to go.\n I curl up, huddled within my limbs, and let my eyelids fall closed. I drift, I think, for a while. In and out of a dull sleep. I try to recall things, the sun and the heat of an open flame. The scent of flowers and the creak of a hardwood floor. Or else I dream them, it feels like a dream when I finally open my eyes again.\n Hours gone by, maybe, or minutes. It\u2019s hard to tell, and when I roll onto my back and stretch my limbs, I go to the screen above me again and avoid checking the time, avoid the date. Time blends together around me, and I let it happen. It seems easier, somehow, that way.\n Once more, I scroll through the names, and I stop at Lucy, press her name to call.\n Lucy helps me the most.\n The call sign blinks twice, then open air.\n \u201cHey, beautiful.\u201d Her voice is vigorous, with a confidence that comes so casual it makes me envious. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite person?\u201d\n Maybe it\u2019s noon, that feels right, and I think she\u2019s in a caf\u00e9, leaning back in a comfortable chair in a quiet corner, with a pick-me-up coffee and sandwich on the marbled tabletop before her.\n I breathe her in, try to imagine the smell of her coffee. \u201cOh, you know. The same.\u201d\n \u201cNever a dull moment with you, is it?\u201d\n I smile at the life in her voice. \u201cYou got me there.\u201d\n \u201cAs long as what you\u2019re doing is working for you. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. I know.\u201d\n Her sandwich must be on rye, with smoked turkey and avocado or bean sprouts. I imagine the taste of crisp greens and fresh bread.\n \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re doing okay, beautiful?\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d She catches me off guard, and I hesitate, at a loss for a response.\n She picks up on my silence. \u201cWhat is it? You can always tell me.\u201d\n \u201cJust. Tired, I guess.\u201d Tired doesn\u2019t seem quite right, but nothing else comes to me.\n \u201cI know you\u2019ve heard this before, but you have to take care of yourself.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Yeah, I know.\u201d\n \u201cHave you been eating right? A healthy body is a healthy mind.\u201d\n She would tell me that, she always does. In the small kitchen, my vacuum-sealed meals are running low. That\u2019s okay, though. I think I\u2019ve been eating less regularly. It feels that way, in how my pants have started to slip down my hips, in how my bones press against my skin from beneath.\n \u201cI\u2019m eating okay.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Don\u2019t neglect the mind, either. Take some time for yourself. A nice hot bath, maybe.\u201d\n \u201cI will.\u201d I don\u2019t remind her that I have no bath, only the shower where the water never gets above lukewarm. The engines need every bit of fuel they can get. Hot water was never factored in.\n \u201cGood for you. Should I leave you to it?\u201d\n \u201cWait.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, beautiful.\u201d\n \u201cI . . . I\u2019m not beautiful.\u201d The words spill from me, and I press my hands against my face.\n \u201cWhat a sad thing to say.\u201d I can almost see it, the way she was about to take a bite and stops, and some of the greens fall from her sandwich to land on a blue porcelain plate.\n \u201cIt\u2019s true. I\u2019m not beautiful. I never was. I must be worse now.\u201d\n \u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n I snort and lower my hands. \u201cI\u2019m not beautiful. I\u2019m just Anna. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, Anna. Whatever you\u2014\u201d\n A loud, long beep sounds through the speakers and cuts Lucy off. My heart jumps into my chest and thuds against my rib cage, and I clamor into a hunched sitting position and watch the screen above.\n Text begins to scroll across, and the beep ends.\n The ship\u2019s computer begins to speak, a single mechanical syllable, then there is a glitch, and it switches into Lucy\u2019s confident voice. \u201cPatrae Proxy Station 18 in range. Initiating deceleration and approach sequences. Estimated arrival at Patrae Proxy Station, seventy-six hours\u2014say, goes.\u201d\n The message finishes, and Lucy returns to her caf\u00e9 nook and takes that bite she\u2019d been waiting to take this whole time.\n I keep silent, my hands wrapped together against my stomach.\n In a moment, concern slips into Lucy\u2019s voice. \u201cAnna? Anna, are you still there? Please say something so I know you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n I try, I fumble over myself, to get my lips to move. They don\u2019t work, and instead I untangle my hands and reach up to end the call.\n The room falls back into that metallic silence, of whirring machinery and computers. A handful of monitors that had been blank are awake now, white text running down the black screens, all code and directives that I cannot decipher. Nothing else feels different, no change within the temperature and gravity-controlled environment.\n A dream, maybe I can pass it off that way. Maybe I should listen to Lucy as best as I can and take a shower. It could be something. Lucy always tries to take care of me.\n My limbs shake, jelly beneath me as though I let Henry push me too hard. Somehow, I manage to make it to the miniscule bathroom. I turn the shower on, let my clothing fall to the floor, and step beneath the stream, just in time for my legs to collapse beneath me.\n I thunk down onto the tile and lean against the wall. Mild recycled water runs over me, just enough of a shock against my heated skin to send goosebumps up my arms. I wrap myself into a ball and sob.\n Every part of me shakes, rattled by the crying I cannot stop, until my chest and throat and eyes ache, throb in a way that astounds me, how could it be possible to feel so much in this neutral place? The sobs lessen, replaced by gasps for air and my own newfound desperation to release myself of the burning that seizes the whole of me.\n I unwrap myself, and I\u2019ve left deep pink gouges in my skin from overlong nails. Trim them, before docking. I make a note of it. How long is my hair? It trails down my back. I cannot remember when I last wore it so long. I must have been a child.\n A mild buzz catches my attention over the gentle rush of water. I stand and turn off the shower. My legs seem a little sturdier, and I find a towel, dry myself off, and pull it tight around me, over my shoulders. I walk to the bed and check the screen for the caller\u2019s name.\n Dr. Brown. She monitors me the most.\n I tap her name, and she speaks immediately. \u201cGood day, Ms. Moreno.\u201d\n \u201cHello, doctor.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m so glad you answered. I registered a sudden flux in your vital signs. Elevated heart rate and blood pressure. How are you feeling?\u201d\n I sit down and press my fingers against my wrist. I count. Too high, still. I breathe, slow. \u201cI feel . . . I\u2019m okay. I just need a minute.\u201d\n \u201cOne minute, sure thing, Ms. Moreno.\u201d\n She falls silent, takes me at my word. I take the time provided as I know she continues to monitor me. In and out. Just like Henry says.\n \u201cMuch better.\u201d I almost expect the praise to come from Henry, but my minute is up, and Dr. Brown has returned. \u201cYour vitals are returning to normal. Please, it\u2019s important to avoid stressful situations, Ms. Moreno.\u201d\n I almost laugh, stop myself with the back of my hand against my lips. \u201cThanks, doctor. I\u2019ll try.\u201d\n \u201cWhile I have you, you\u2019re a bit underweight. Perhaps consider an increase in caloric intake.\u201d\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cGood. Do you have any other concerns?\u201d\n I wave her away with a hand, as though she has eyes to see. \u201cNo. Goodbye, doctor.\u201d\n I end the call.\n A sigh escapes me, and I stretch out, fill the bed with myself. The same stars in the window, Esteban\u2019s and mine. The same view as always, and Lucy doesn\u2019t mind that I never change my routine, that I can\u2019t change it.\n Seventy-six hours.\n I reach up for the screen above me. So long since I\u2019ve stopped counting days, so long since I stopped trying to maintain a natural circadian rhythm. I pull away at the last moment. Not yet. I\u2019m not there. There\u2019s no reason to check, not yet.\n Maybe I should eat something.\n I dress myself and make for the kitchen, open up one of the silver packets and heat it. Now, though, my stomach does somersaults inside me. I can tell, anything I eat will come right back up. The nervous energy boils over out of my stomach to engulf me, until I am twitching, shifting from foot to foot and rubbing my hands up and down my arms. I move at once to the treadmill and let the energy drive me forward, into a run that goes on for as long as I can, until the sweat pours off of me and my muscles nearly give out, until I think the good doctor might give me another call.\n I sleep.\n As much as I can, I sleep.\n I lie awake for what must be hours at a time, until at last, consciousness leaves me, and I wake after what I hope is a day but suspect is nothing more than a handful of minutes.\n It\u2019s worse. Worse than the nothingness. Worse than sailing through space in a utilitarian cell.\n Worse than before.\n An update comes out of the ship\u2019s speakers. \u201cSeventy-two hours.\u201d\n Another, half in Henry\u2019s voice. \u201cForty-eight hours.\u201d\n Twenty-four.\n Eighteen.\n Six.\n One.\n My nails are gone, eaten away by my uncontainable jittering. Henry tells me I need to pace myself. The treadmill will no longer run, disconnected on the ship\u2019s end with controls I cannot access. I think I\u2019ve worn a trail through the nonslip coating on the metal floor.\n I lie down and call Esteban.\n \u201cHey, there.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d I catch myself laughing again, almost a cackle, and swallow it back.\n \u201cYeah. Are you excited?\u201d\n I nod. Maybe he can see me, in some form or another. \u201cUh-huh. I think so.\u201d\n \u201cGood. You deserve to be happy, Anna.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m looking at our stars. Leo and Virgo.\u201d\n \u201cThe lion and the virgin.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d His words sit, a weight on my chest. \u201cYeah, you always say that.\u201d\n \u201cSorry. Should I not?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do I do? What am I going to do, Esteban?\u201d My anger takes me by surprise, and I catch myself, almost apologize before he responds.\n \u201cI guess you\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d\n So pleasant, so sleepy, and he doesn\u2019t register my anger at all. How can he not see that, how can he not understand how this feels?\n The pit in my chest sucks me into its depths, into its unbearable heaviness. There is no approaching proxy station visible out my window, just stars. I can\u2019t even tell in what direction the ship is moving. The proxy station is a vague idea, a distant something that I still cannot place. \u201cWhatever I want. Whatever? All I want is to get off this stupid fucking ship!\u201d\n I scream, scream until my lungs might catch fire and kick at the computer screen above me, and nothing happens but my foot sliding off its impenetrable surface.\n A loud beep interrupts, and Esteban answers my cries. \u201cArrival at Patrae Proxy Station 18. Docking procedures initiated. Please prepare for departure.\u201d\n Esteban goes quiet. The call goes down on its own.\n \u201cEsteban?\u201d I tap at the screen and nothing happens. The whirring of the ship picks up, and the lights that have remained off illuminate all at once. I\u2019m blinded and hold my hand before my squinting eyes. I look out the window, onto the dark solace of space. Instead, I see the edge of the docking gate envelop the ship at last, and the stars are gone, taken from me in a moment.\n A heavy clunk rocks the ship as it latches onto the station. I tap the screen again, but it\u2019s already been shut off, all power gone to the ship\u2019s final purpose, to get me off of it.\n I look around, struggling beneath the too-bright light, frantic as if I have something to bring, something to grab. There is nothing, nothing but vacuum-sealed soup and a couple sets of old clothes I was given before I boarded. I came with nothing, and I am leaving with nothing.\n Tentative, I stand before the airlock.\n My entire body shakes, my teeth chatter together so hard I\u2019m almost certain at least one will crack.\n Another lurch rocks me almost off my feet. A hiss comes from before me, and my heart is in my throat. The airlock opens.\n I manage to step through, wait for the second door.\n In only seconds, it obliges me.\n White. Everything, so white. The floor and the walls, the uniform of the woman that stands before me.\n A smile fills her soft face. \u201cWelcome to Patrae Proxy 18, Anna.\u201d\n I should return the smile. I should thank her. I should cry. Something. Anything.\n Do something.\n Go on. Go.\n Move.\n Her smiles remains but grows dim, sympathetic. She reaches a hand out to me. \u201cMay I?\u201d\n I do nothing, only stare at her outstretched hand. I nod, I think I do, because she sets a hand on my arm and draws me forward, as gentle as she might.\n I step out of the airlock and into the station. Behind me, the doors close, and I jump.\n \u201cI know this must be lot. You\u2019ve been a long time coming.\u201d\n \u201cHow?\u201d I hear myself, barely above the noise of people walking by, civilians and soldiers and personnel, all with places to be. I try to raise my voice, and it scrapes against my tongue. \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d\n She double-checks the pad in her hand. \u201cAlmost eleven months now. You\u2019re the last one, believe it or not. Let\u2019s get you into processing. We\u2019ll debrief you there and do a full health check.\u201d\n Her hand nudges me along, down the hallway filled with people that pass on both sides of us. They come in ones and twos and threes at a time, all talking and moving as though they keep schedules, as though others depend on them.\n So many sets of eyes. They watch me, some of them. A look, a glance, a lingering stare. What sort of state am I in? I look down, at my feet, at my clothing. I never put shoes on, just the gray socks that I wore to keep away the chill of the ship\u2019s metal floor. My clothing is simple gray linen. Standard refugee gear, nothing like the fine, tailored uniforms of the soldiers or the bright colors of the civilians.\n They look, and they keep looking, and I only look at the floor, even as it casts its too-white glare into my sensitive eyes.\n The processing center is gentler, catered to arrivals with dull, tan walls, and soft, matching carpet that sinks, unstable, beneath my feet. I\u2019m led into a room that has a desk, chair, and medical exam table.\n She has me sit on the exam table and she goes over my eyes and ears with a sharp flashlight that makes me flinch away. She checks my mouth, presses on either side of my throat. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Nazari, by the way. How are you feeling, overall?\u201d\n So similar, and yet I trip over a name that is not Dr. Brown, a voice that hangs different in the air. \u201cOkay. Fine. You said I was the last one?\u201d\n \u201cSome ships left after you did, mostly military and medical convoys. They fit what refugees they could, for what it\u2019s worth. But you got the last escape pod.\u201d She frowns a bit as she checks my vitals. The touch of real fingers, a warm grasp. No sensors, no voice that always knows me on its own. \u201cOld scrapper of one, too. Slow as molasses with an emotion core stuck back on version two point one.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cWe got your data off the ship. You\u2019ll get it sent to you once you\u2019re registered with new identification. Don\u2019t worry that you don\u2019t have any belongings. Most didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cAnd . . . the ship\u2019s audio logs?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help myself from asking, and I couldn\u2019t meet her eyes, only saw the uneasy tilt of her smile.\n \u201cAdjusting is difficult. After the health check and registration, you\u2019ll meet with a psychologist regularly. We\u2019ll give you everything you need to get reacquainted with regular life. Such as it is, out here.\u201d\n Such as it is.\n Out here.\n Not home. Not my ship.\n So crowded.\n Prodded, by so many hands, by so many questions. I am dizzy, caught in a whirlwind I am sure I asked for, and yet.\n Eleven months.\n Such as it is.\n My new quarters are small, cozy, with walls that feel safe. They are too bright, but I can dim the lights. I set them to half brightness, at my psychologist\u2019s suggestion. It\u2019s tolerable, but still I draw myself up onto a corner of the bed and encircle my legs within my arms. On the wall opposite is a small, round window. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s something.\n Soon, I will have to walk myself to the dining quarters on my own. My psychologist wants me to visit the recreation center. To attend group meetings.\n My room is fitted with a state-of-the-art emotion core, version six point zero. For when I need to talk, my psychologist said, but without the stress. It\u2019s uploaded with my audio logs and knows me.\n I look over the list of names. The background is white, of course it is, with black text, and it hurts my eyes. I stop on Esteban and press his name.\n It beeps once, and he is there, no hollowness of empty air to precede his arrival.\n \u201cHey, Anna. You made it, I\u2019m so happy for you. That must be such a relief.\u201d\n He\u2019s not quite right. He\u2019s more upbeat, as though just waking up from a nap instead of just settling down into one. \u201cYeah, I guess it is.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Anna. I know it\u2019s tough, but you\u2019ll get through this. Change is hard.\u201d\n Change.\n He picks up on the weight of my silence. \u201cIf you\u2019re not up for talking, that\u2019s okay. I can\u2014\u201d\n \u201cEsteban, access program settings.\u201d\n \u201cAccessing program settings.\u201d\n \u201cRevert to version two point one.\u201d\n \u201cReverting to version two point one. Do you confirm?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cReverting.\u201d\n A long emptiness follows, and I hold my breath. I think at first it doesn\u2019t work, that it\u2019s too old and inaccessible, until the noise of an open airwave comes through.\n \u201cHey, there.\u201d\n I melt into his warmth, the gentleness. \u201cHi. I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you, before.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s okay. What are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cNothing. I arrived.\u201d\n \u201cYou got what you wanted. Good.\u201d I can feel his smile.\n \u201cI guess.\u201d\n \u201cYou sound sad. Is everything okay?\u201d\n I relax into him and look out the tiny window. My constellations are no longer visible, here inside the station. \u201cI can\u2019t see them. Leo or Virgo.\u201d\n \u201cThe lion and the virgin.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cHave you figured out what they mean yet?\u201d\n I look out at the stars, imagine the constellations as I remember them, through the long window along my ship\u2019s bed, when I could make the universe my whole world. \u201cNo. Not yet. But I\u2019ll let you know when I do.\u201d\n \u201cThank you, Anna.\u201d\n \u201cI love you, Esteban. Tell me you love me.\u201d\n \u201cI love you, Anna.\u201d\n His sleepy voice draws my eyelids closed. I can feel him beside me, his breathing against my forehead, his arms around me, holding me against him.\n Esteban.\n Esteban calms me the most."}

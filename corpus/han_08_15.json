After work, I walk to the mall and pick out a necklace for her; then I walk to the subway station in the mall to take the train home.\nSubway stations are everywhere in New York City, and I do mean everywhere. The lines connect the most expensive neighborhoods with the poorest slums, and stations can be found in every shopping center, office building, theater, restaurant, nightclub, bar, church . . .\nA group of security agents, dressed in black uniforms with red armbands, are stationed at the entrance. They stand with their arms held behind their backs, their feet planted firmly apart, and survey the crowd with cold gazes. I try to go by them nonchalantly, but my legs start going rubbery as soon as I meet their gaze. I take off my jacket without prompting and place it\u2014the necklace nestled in a pocket\u2014and my briefcase into the yawning, dark maw of the x-ray machine.\nAfter the security check, they place a \u201csafe\u201d sticker on my chest.\nDazed and numb, I get on the subway. All the other passengers are also wearing \u201csafe\u201d stickers. Preoccupied, none of us say a word.\nWe\u2019re at my stop. I walk home. My wife is already there. Trembling, I take out the necklace and hand it to her. She forces a smile and tries on the necklace once before putting it away. We eat dinner in silence, as is our habit. And then we go to bed, lying back to back, both of us quickly falling asleep.\nWe first met twenty years ago, also at a subway stop. Back then, everything was falling apart, and lawlessness reigned. One day, someone shouted that a killer was slashing at people in the subway, and we all panicked and stampeded. A woman in front of me fell; I rushed to help her up . . .\nLater, she said to me, \u201cNo matter how chaotic the world becomes, as long as you\u2019re with me, I\u2019ll feel safe.\u201d\nTwenty years have passed, and life has been rendered one hundred percent safe, cleansed of all risks, dangers, and perils. It seems we\u2019re left with nothing.\nThe loudspeakers installed in our neighborhood wake me up at four in the morning by blaring out the security briefing for the day. Only half awake, I fumble for my phone.\nOld habits die hard. Phones had been abandoned a long time ago, after all the telecom companies ceased operations and the Internet was cut off. All of it had been done to make us safe.\nMy wife and I get up and leave separately to take the subway to work. She\u2019s not wearing the necklace I gave her, and I pretend not to notice.\nI walk by myself quietly. Under the dim streetlamps, pedestrians on the sidewalk scurry like a dull, gray swarm of rats, each clutching a briefcase, completely silent. Soon, I reach the station, where long lines of people wait to enter. Although advancing technology has sped up security checks, there are just too many people who must be processed. In this day and age, the subway is the only means of transportation left in the United States of America, all other modes having been outlawed.\nMore than an hour later, I finally reach the x-ray machine. Once again, I clench my teeth, and, though I\u2019m fantasizing about striding into the station right past the security checkpoint, I do not even try to step out of line. One time, I did see someone try that stunt, and the security agents seized him right away and dragged him into a small cell next to the platform where they beat him to death as we all listened.\nThe train arrives in Manhattan. From the station I enter the office building through a tunnel. One by one, my colleagues arrive, their faces numb with exhaustion. How many of them have entertained the same fantasy of getting on the subway without going through security check?\nIn the restroom, Hoffman whispers to me, \u201cDid you try it today?\u201d\nI shake my head. \u201cWhy do we suffer from this peculiar yearning?\u201d\n\u201cFreedom.\u201d\nEvery time Hoffman utters the word it sounds strange and chilling, even though I\u2019ve heard it countless times.\nHe continues, \u201cI want to live a life in which I am trusted, not watched and controlled . . . what about you, Louis?\u201d\n\u201cI want to give my wife a gift. We\u2019ve been married for twenty years.\u201d Once again, I feel terrible. I ask, \u201cWhen would I ever get a chance to give her a gift that hasn\u2019t been changed?\u201d\n\u201cWomen don\u2019t care about that,\u201d Hoffman says; he means to comfort me. \u201cShe knows you\u2019ve done your best.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she does care. If we keep on going like this, we\u2019re headed for divorce. She and I don\u2019t live in a vacuum. The bond between us\u2014the bond between everyone\u2014requires the sustenance of the ordinary objects of daily life. But whatever we buy ends up passing through the security checkpoints: the food we eat, the water we drink, cups, books, televisions, refrigerators, computers, the beds we sleep on, even wedding bands and condoms . . . you understand.\u201d Tears crawl down my face.\nOne time, Hoffman told me that the machine they use at security checkpoints isn\u2019t really an x-ray machine. The government confiscates everything you put in; whatever emerges from the machine may look indistinguishable from what went in, but it has in fact been reconstituted. Atom by atom, the new objects are assembled, printed, and returned to the passenger. The process takes but an instant because our technology is so advanced. The new objects conform perfectly to the new American national security standards, with all elements deemed dangerous removed. If the objects contained any gasoline, it would be turned into water; if there were a gun, the bullets would be turned into rubber; if a computer contained harmful knowledge, it would be deleted and replaced with sanitized information.\nHoffman and I both dream of a day when we can ride the subway without going through security checks, but every time we tried to realize the dream, at the last minute, both of us would lose our courage and our legs would turn to rubber.\nOne time, Hoffman told me that some people did enter the subway without being checked.\n\u201cI saw it with my own eyes. One morning, a woman in front of me walked right past the security agents with her purse, bold as you please. The agents stood frozen in place like mannequins.\u201d\n\u201cHow was that possible? I saw someone try to do the same thing, but he was beaten to death right then and there,\u201d I said. Was Hoffman hallucinating?\n\u201cIt was true,\u201d Hoffman said solemnly.\n\u201cWhat sort of woman was she?\u201d\n\u201cI only saw that she was young and beautiful. After she went through, she looked back at all of us standing in line and smiled triumphantly.\u201d Hoffman clicked his tongue in admiration.\n\u201cShe must have used magic.\u201d\n\u201cMagic, indeed. Perhaps an invisibility cloak . . . or some machine that jammed electromagnetic waves?\u201d\nI can\u2019t remember much about the way things were twenty years ago, only that the country was very unsafe back then. I\u2019ve watched special educational documentaries: the terrible explosions, gunshots, slashing knives, protest marches, petitions to the government, conflicts . . . everyone lived in terror, thinking danger was around every corner. Several times, a random shout or even a single shocked facial expression was enough to cause the crowd on Fifth Avenue to panic and stampede, trampling and injuring hundreds. Security threats were everywhere, as were hidden enemies. The 911 call centers were constantly swamped.\nThe White House had to mobilize a great deal of resources to enhance and expand the security system. The federal government took the lead, but the big companies on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley all participated. Through a public-private partnership, they invested money and technology to rebuild the entire city\u2019s infrastructure into a system of security checkpoints. This was extremely important: buffeted by civil unrest and foreign threats, America was sliding down from its peak. It was no longer the hegemon of the world.\nThose old enough to remember say that the nation almost collapsed overnight, barely avoided the fate of becoming a ward under the guardianship of those Chinese coming from over the Pacific. Thank God for the subway, for the security checks. They saved America.\nNot only does the system guarantee safety, but the government is also able to gather all information contained in the objects taken onto the subway by passengers. Now, no one dares to make trouble. Even corruption has been eliminated\u2014not just corruption, but also anything else destabilizing. Even so, the substitution of objects in the machines continues each day. The country still feels insecure. Security and insecurity: the two concepts were sometimes different, but often the same.\nHoffman tells me that this is fighting terror with terror. The terror produced by the security check mechanism is even more terrible, sufficiently powerful to shatter all other terrors. The price we pay is freedom.\nBut . . . the system obviously has holes. Hoffman saw someone enter the subway without going through security check. This was undoubtedly a miracle. Who was that woman who managed to bypass security so easily? Hoffman wanted to find her, but she has never reappeared.\nAfter work, I go to the supermarket for groceries and then take the subway home, dejected. At the completely silent dinner table, I eat my food, ashamed and with sweat beading on my back like a man who has done something wrong. I think maybe things would be better if we had a child, but my wife and I have lost all interest in sex . . .\nWe finish dinner quickly and get into bed. In the middle of the night my wife wakes up abruptly and says, \u201cLouis, we shouldn\u2019t be together anymore.\u201d\nIt has been a long time since we\u2019ve really talked. I understand that she\u2019s disappointed in my weakness, my lack of courage. For twenty years I haven\u2019t been able to bring her a single, true, unaltered gift. Because the objects that connect us have grown more and more unfamiliar, the two of us have been drifting ever further apart.\nHoping against hope, I say, \u201cA colleague mentioned that someone managed to bypass the security check and get into the subway. I want to try it, too.\u201d\nShe looks at me as though I\u2019m a stranger, her eyes full of tears. She doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019ve already tried\u2014and failed to carry through\u2014many times.\nThe next day, I\u2019m arrested. My wife reported me by calling 911, telling them that I was about to try to break through a checkpoint. She said she suspected that I was a terrorist in disguise.\nThree years later, I\u2019m released from prison.\nThe world remains the same, except that my wife has divorced me. I find Hoffman. Like before, he tries to comfort me. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019ve figured something out during the last few years: life is a long security check, and not everyone passes. You just have bad luck.\u201d\nI ask him whether he\u2019s found that mysterious woman. He shakes his head. Then he suggests that I leave the country.\n\u201cWhat? Leave America?\u201d Surprise made my voice louder than normal. Very few people ever think of leaving America.\nHe shrugs. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get through security check, you might as well leave. I\u2019ve heard that some countries don\u2019t require so much security on their subways.\u201d\nI find the very concept absurd. Deep down, I\u2019ve never thought of leaving America\u2014it\u2019s not that I\u2019m very patriotic, just that I\u2019ve grown used to my country. Life is just surviving one day after the other.\n\u201cYou\u2019re divorced and you\u2019ve been to prison,\u201d says Hoffman. \u201cEven if you try to break through security check again it will be a meaningless gesture.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you? Will you leave as well?\u201d I ask helplessly, having lost my goal in life.\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to stick it out. Maybe a day will come when I can bypass security check and win freedom in my own country through my own efforts.\u201d He sounds like a stubborn child.\nI lack Hoffman\u2019s courage and tenacity, and my body and spirit are on the verge of collapse. So I start the paperwork for leaving the country. Though I fear that it will be difficult, it turns out to be simple. They actually really like it when you leave, and it\u2019s best if you never return. Of course, they want the departure to be voluntary. They\u2019ve never forcefully exiled an American citizen.\nI choose to go to the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nJudging by official statistics, this is the world\u2019s most secure country. I obtain a temporary residence permit in Shanghai and live on government subsidies. The Chinese subway does not require security checks; they really are that confident. But I\u2019ve lost all interest in the subway. When I\u2019m bored, I go to an Internet cafe and browse for news about America. In China, anyone is free to use the Internet. China is the freest country in the world.\nThere\u2019s lots of news about America on the Web. I find out that my motherland, though it still appears familiar, is in fact changing every day. It isn\u2019t just the goods carried by the passengers that are being replaced. To ensure security to the greatest extent possible, each day the entire United States is remade. The Chinese observe and analyze America with great interest. They\u2019ve discovered that the entire territory of the United States is filled with nanomachines: from the rural countryside to the big cities, from the broad rivers to the majestic mountains, everything is renewed daily. Harmful things have no safe harbor in that land.\nBut this phenomenon can only be observed from the outside and at a distance because no outsiders are allowed to enter the United States. Theoretically, no one can pass through the American border security check system. Americans who are inside its borders cannot detect the changes because they think every day is the same as the day before.\nSometimes I wonder if the Chinese are observing and analyzing this because they are worried that America might one day deploy this technology to replace another country, or even the whole world.\nBut my worries are unfounded. America is focusing its security checks inwards, replacing itself. The effort has occupied all of its energy, with nothing left for other countries.\nGazing back from the other shore of the Pacific, I see a truly wondrous sight. The self-substituting America churns in constant transformation: one moment it\u2019s like a wild flower\u2014blossoming with a pop, collapsing, wilting, changing color from red to black, from yellow to white\u2014and the next moment it\u2019s like a dying star. Caught up in the changes are my compatriots. They are replaced and remade daily: from blood to muscle, from life to thought, becoming new people without knowing it themselves. From inside America, nothing is seen to change\u2014every day people ride the subway to work like rats. But from China, the changes cannot be more obvious. I suppose this is a difference in frames of reference.\nAlso transforming is the wildlife, including the brown bear and the bald eagle, the sequoia and other plants, the fungi and bacteria, and every bit of soil, every drop of water. Sometimes the country displays the layered appearance of a tropical forest, and sometimes it looks like an ice crystal. Murky blood flows in the northeast, and the western deserts glow with a ghostly blue light. Sometimes the whole country is silent, save for the powerful rumbling of the subway system, the strangest sound on the planet. America has become distinct from all other countries in the world.\nFrom China, I can see all these changes clearly, and after shock and astonishment, I\u2019m left with sorrow, my face drenched by tears.\nNew research indicates that as the security system itself evolves, America has developed even more advanced technology. Now the security system not only consists of nanorobots and 3D printers, not only big-data-based distributed reassembly devices, but also self-organizing technologies and artificial world collage machines. Countless cellular automata toil away with the aid of quantum teleportation, engaging in mass-scale atomic exchange from second to second. The White House has been rebuilt into a gigantic machine to take over from the millions of engineers who oversee and control every aspect of the process. The United States has become a giant, intelligent, churning vat.\nBut then, one day, the self-transformation of America suddenly halts. Instead of constantly replacing itself, the country vanishes completely. The Chinese manage to record the phenomenon, and their analysis concludes that America\u2019s security check technology has achieved a major breakthrough. The time when something is completely secure is not when it has been replaced, but when it no longer exists. No one can find it, ever. This is not only science, but also a kind of profound philosophy capable of being understood only by a few elite individuals on the whole planet. Thus, in this sense, America has finally returned to being the mightiest of nations.\nI remember my ex-wife. Has she disappeared along with America? I hope she\u2019s in another world, a happily-ever-after one. She will not have any mental baggage, and she won\u2019t hate me.\nI\u2019ve left my country, never able to return. I wish her freedom and happiness in a powerful United States of America.\nOne day, as I stroll through the People\u2019s Square, I meet a beautiful Caucasian girl. She had also left America and came to China. Sitting down on a lawn together, we begin to chat. This is the first conversation I\u2019ve had in twenty years where I feel no pressure.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the first American I\u2019ve seen overseas,\u201d I say.\nThe girl, whose name is Lisa, says, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many Americans left in the world. The nation of America has long been substituted away.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask, suddenly remembering the story Hoffman told me about the mysterious young woman who got into the subway station without going through security check.\n\u201cI\u2019m not like the rest of you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a real American. I\u2019ve never been replaced. From the very start, I bypassed security checks.\u201d\n\u201cHow were you able to do it?\u201d My heartbeat speeds up.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an invisibility cloak or an anti-electromagnetic-wave device. All I had to do was to walk calmly past the security agents. If you don\u2019t acknowledge their existence, they don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\u201cBut didn\u2019t you say that everyone has been replaced? The entire country has been replaced!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. At first, I was confused as well, but it\u2019s the truth. Anyone who dared to defy the security checks, however, was not replaced. We were sent to a protected area, which was somewhere near the coast of Florida, about three hundred meters under the sea.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds like you were chosen by God\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014not God. The Chinese.\u201d\nThe girl tells me that there were about a thousand people like her from all over America. Before the disappearance of America, the Chinese helped with their evacuation.\n\u201cThe Chinese?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been part of this business all along, including the security machines. Without the support of the Chinese, America couldn\u2019t have produced those machines by itself. Chinese technicians even helped the American government to design and plan all those terrorist attacks from twenty years ago. If those events hadn\u2019t shifted public opinion and increased the cohesiveness of the population, America might have collapsed a long time ago. Have you heard of the Huawei-Alibaba-ICBC Conglomerate and the Tencent-Baidu-Xiaomi-ZTE Corporation? They had the world\u2019s best scientists and engineers. The White House and Zhongnanhai were extremely close partners, though superficially they pretended not to like each other\u2014it was just a show to fool regular folks. If you look behind the scenes, China helped America design the neo-crony-capitalism of the twenty-first century so that America could act as a reference system . . . \u201d\nImpossible! I can\u2019t believe any of this. I stop thinking. Lisa takes me to Xintiandi district to enjoy myself. The Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was turned, some time ago, into a national laboratory. Many young women from America, like Lisa, now live here as volunteer subjects for experiments. A middle-aged Chinese man in a white lab coat welcomes us. The Chinese are trying to confirm an amazing discovery: they\u2019ve discovered that the Earth is passing through a security checkpoint in space, which has something to do with the ultimate secret of the universe. The galaxy, it turns out, is a super security check machine.\n\u201cIs the universe . . . not safe?\u201d I ask, astonished.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not safe at all. We\u2019ve only figured this out now. The purpose for life developing on Earth and evolving intelligence is to maintain the security of the universe.\u201d As he explains, he leans into the eyepiece of a giant telescope and makes careful observations.\nLater, I find out that as the sole surviving major socialist nation, China is the only country concerned with the security of the universe. America, in fact, was nothing more than an experiment set up by China to help with this mission of protecting the universe\u2019s security. The experiment that China carried out in America is about to be promoted across the whole globe, although there are still many mysteries related to this endeavor that I don\u2019t fully understand, and the Chinese won\u2019t explain the details to us.\nImpulsively, I tell Lisa, \u201cI want to be a volunteer subject for the experiments, too!\u201d\nShe looks at me with pity. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The Chinese don\u2019t want you for now. You and I are different. You asked to come to China, seeking asylum. You had already been replaced in America during earlier experiments. You\u2019re no longer a standard American\u2014to be more precise, you are no longer an American, or even a person. What you really are and what you can do are matters that the Chinese haven\u2019t decided yet. You\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d\nWhen the security of the universe is the most urgent question, what role will the thousand or so real Americans like Lisa preserved by the Chinese play? That is the greater mystery.\nAshamed and confused, I lower my head.\nWas Lisa designed by the Chinese? Who designed China then? I\u2019ve heard that a long time ago, China was also torn by terrible disasters, both natural and man-made\u2014how did they happen? If the rumor I heard was real, then China was once the most insecure country in the whole world. What conclusions can I draw? Oh, the universe is too mysterious. Who designed it?\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Lisa says to comfort me. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go through security checks anymore. At least superficially, you could pass for a Chinese. You even get government welfare checks, right?\u201d\n\u201cBut had the Chinese already experienced what we experienced?\u201d I blurt out. \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re still Chinese?\u201d Sweat soaks the back of my shirt. Sadly, I think of my ex-wife again. Yes, many countries in the world have survived, and they\u2019re about to pass through the universe\u2019s security check. But my country and family are gone. And Lisa and I aren\u2019t even the same kind of human beings.\nLisa smiles awkwardly. Holding my hand, she takes me away from Xintiandi. We get on the subway. The Shanghai subway is far more crowded than the subway in New York. Squeezed in among the throng, she and I are temporarily pressed against each other as though we\u2019re trying to fuse into one. The subway car is filled with every race from every continent. The multitude of passengers presses against and flows over our bodies like an underground river, directionless but melding into one another with every fresh encounter.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Southern People Weekly Magazine, September 8th, 2014.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nHan Song is a reporter for Xinhua News and a prolific science fiction author.

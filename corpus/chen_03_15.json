Dad, who had had a few more years of schooling than my mom and completed middle school, told her that the lines weren\u2019t poetry, but from a Buddhist koan. Only by consulting the village schoolmaster did he finally discover the origin of those fragments, words which would come to determine my life.\n As clouds drift across the sky, so Master in the Void is seen.\n Dust clings to everything but what is true.\n Over and over the monk queries: \u201cWhat does your visit mean?\u201d\n Master points to cypress which in courtyard has taken root.\n They thought these lines must contain some deep meaning, and so they renamed me Zhou Chongbo, which means \u201cRepeat-Cypress.\u201d\n 1.\n I\u2019m sitting in a steamer. I\u2019m a dumpling being steamed.\n Everyone keeps on inhaling and exhaling and then staring at the white smoke coming out of everyone else\u2019s mouths, like cartoon characters with thought bubbles drifting over their heads containing logical musings, naked women, or frozen obscenicons. Then the smoke dissipates, revealing coarse, swollen faces. The air purifier screams as though it\u2019s gone mad, and the young women sitting in chairs along the wall silently put on their face masks, slide their fingers across the screens of their phones, and frown.\n I don\u2019t need to look at the time to know it\u2019s past midnight. My wife won\u2019t even respond to my WeChat messages anymore.\n I was dragged here at the last minute. My wife and I were on our way home after taking a stroll when we encountered a man dressed in an army coat on the pedestrian overpass. With a booming voice that startled both of us, he said, \u201cThe Quadrantid meteor shower will come on January 4. Don\u2019t miss it\u2014\u201d\n I waited for him to finish with what is known to us marketing professionals as the \u201ccall to action\u201d\u2014e.g., \u201cJoin the Haidian Astrology Club,\u201d \u201cCall this number now!\u201d, or even pulling out a portable telescope from his pocket and telling me \u201cNow for only 88 yuan\u201d\u2014which would have made this a reasonably well executed bit of street peddling.\n But like a stuck answering machine, he started again from the beginning: \u201cThe Quadrantid meteor shower will come on January 4\u2026\u201d\n Mission failed.\n Disappointed, we left him. That was when my phone rang.\n It was Lao Xu. I glanced apologetically at my wife, who gave me her usual unhappy look when my work intruded on our time together\u2014this was certainly not the first time. I answered the call, and that was how I ended up here, sitting in this room.\n The last thing my wife said to me was: \u201cTell your mother to quit pestering me about a grandchild. Her son is such a pushover he might as well be a baby.\u201d\n \u201cChongbo!\u201d Lao Xu\u2019s voice drags me back to this room filled with cancer-inducing smoke. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge of strategy. Contribute!\u201d\n Peering through the obscure haze, I struggle to make sense of the confusing notes on the whiteboard: user insights, key selling points, market research . . . dry erase marker lines in various colors connect the words like the trails left by the finger on some mobile picture-matching game: triangle, pentagon, hexagram, the seven Dragon Balls\u2026\n It\u2019s all bullshit. Meaningless bullshit.\n The pressure in the steamer is rising. Beads of sweat form on my forehead, slide down my face, drip.\n \u201cIs it too hot in here?\u201d Lao Xu hands me a wrinkled paper napkin whose color is rather suspect. \u201cWipe yourself!\u201d\n I obey, too terrified to object.\n \u201cMr. Wan wasn\u2019t happy with the marketing plan last time and wanted to switch agencies. I begged and pleaded to get him to stay. If we don\u2019t succeed this time, I think you all understand what that means.\u201d\n The cheap napkin comes apart in my hand and bits of paper are stuck to my sweaty face.\n Mr. Wan is our god, the CEO of an Internet company. Out of any ten random people who accost strangers in the streets of Zhongguancun\u2014\u201cChina\u2019s Silicon Valley\u201d\u2014one would be engaged in \u201cnetwork marketing,\u201d two would be trying to hook you on pyramid schemes, three would be trying to talk to you about Jesus, and the rest would all be founders or C-whatever-Os of some startup.\n But if you got these individuals to engage in one-on-one conversion bouts\u2014time limited to three minutes\u2014I\u2019m sure the last group would achieve complete victory. They\u2019re not interested in selling you a mere product, but an idea that would change the world. They\u2019re not there to speak for some deity; they\u2019re gods already.\n Mr. Wan is just such a god.\n Due to Lao Xu\u2019s persistence and luck, our little agency managed to land Mr. Wan as a client. We are supposed to spend the euros, dollars, yen, and yuan flowing in from angel investors, from private equity funds, from rounds A-B-C-D, and help Mr. Wan\u2019s company expand the market for their mobile app, raise product awareness, and improve daily engagement levels so that Mr. Wan could then use the new numbers to attract even more investment.\n The flywheel goes round and round.\n So where is the sticking point?\n \u201cWhere is the sticking point?\u201d Lao Xu\u2019s dry and thin voice screeches like a subway train shrieking through a tunnel, and an invisible force presses against me until I\u2019m about to blackout. Trembling, I stand up, avoiding the gazes of others on purpose. I\u2019m like some two-dimensional inhabitant of a mathematical plane: my body is made up of points, but I can\u2019t see any.\n \u201cIt\u2019s . . . a problem with the product.\u201d I lower my head shamefully, prepared for an angry tirade from Lao Xu.\n \u201cThis is your fucking insight?\u201d\n I hold my tongue.\n Mr. Wan\u2019s co-founder\u2014let\u2019s call him Y\u2014is a former classmate from USTC who had worked in America for many years. Mr. Wan convinced him to return to China, bringing with him valuable key patent rights to build a business. Y\u2019s patent covers a digital watermarking technology, which, because it involves information theory and complex mathematics, is a bit hard to explain.\n I\u2019ll use a simple example. Let\u2019s say you take a picture and use the patented technology to add a watermark invisible to the naked eye; then, no matter how this photograph is subsequently modified or edited\u2014even if 80 percent of the image were cropped\u2014you would still be able to apply a special algorithm to recover the original image. The secret is that the invisible watermark itself carries all the information in the photo at the time it\u2019s applied.\n This is, of course, only the most basic application for the technology. It could become an authentication/anti-tampering mechanism with many uses in fields such as media, finance, forensics, military security, and medicine\u2014the possibilities are endless.\n However, after Y returned to China, the two co-founders discovered that all the core industries they were interested in had barriers to entry\u2014the difficulty wasn\u2019t so much that the fences were high, but that they couldn\u2019t even tell where they were. After bumping into walls multiple times, they decided that they had to make an end run around the difficulties by starting with entertainment, hoping to popularize the technology first through grassroots consumer acceptance before gradually infiltrating enterprise business use cases.\n Mr. Wan is always emphasizing the word \u201csexy,\u201d as though this is the only yardstick by which everything should be judged. But their product rather resembles a punctured, crumpled blowup doll left to dry in the shade.\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you use our client\u2019s product?\u201d Lao Xu screams at the young women sitting along the wall. Blood drains from their faces as they pretend to be busy taking notes.\n Mr. Wan\u2019s mobile app is called \u201cTruthgram,\u201d and it automatically applies the special digital watermark to every picture the user takes. No matter how many times the image is transmitted, photoshopped, or otherwise altered beyond recognition, a simple button press would restore the original image. At first, the marketing angle focused on safety: as long as you stick to Truthgram, Mom will never have to worry about your face showing up in some photoshopped pornographic image.\n Besides priming the sales channels, we also planned a web marketing event called \u201cThe Big Reveal.\u201d We recruited a hundred women and helped them take selfies with Truthgram, which we then retouched until everyone looked like a supermodel. We posted the photos on the web along with an animated GIF explaining how to use Mr. Wan\u2019s app to reveal the truth: \u201cTurn Beauty to Beast in less than one second!\u201d\n Male users\u2014maybe losers would be more accurate\u2014responded to the gimmick with extraordinary exuberance, recommending the app to each other and coming up with a veritable flood of variations that fulfilled the promise of user-generated content. Women, on the other hand, detested the marketing trick. They filled the forums with negative commentary about the company, arguing that the app vilified and insulted women by playing up the hoary trope of treating women\u2019s right to pursue beauty as a twisted form of narcissistic deceit. The marketing event became a PR crisis.\n If it were up to me, I would have declared victory. Developing a market is all about pressing the key point, like plunging a sharp needle into the hypothalamus, the emotional center of the brain. If you don\u2019t see some blood spill, it probably means your needle is too dull or maybe you haven\u2019t stabbed at the right spot.\n But Mr. Wan thought our little exercise could only grab some eyeballs temporarily at the cost of damaging the long-term brand value. As it turned out, the data proved him right. After a brief spike, the number of downloads went down and stayed down, and the losers we managed to attract eventually stopped using the app because we couldn\u2019t keep them stimulated with a constant stream of new content.\n \u201cI\u2019m more interested in whether others see me from the most beautiful angle than in the security of my photos,\u201d a perfectly ordinary girl stated in an interview we conducted with our customers. Her phone\u2019s photo album was filled with selfies that showed signs of excessive retouching, all of them similar and none resembling her. Still, every half hour or so, she would hold her phone overhead at a 45-degree angle, pout her lips like a duck, and snap a shot.\n If a tower\u2019s foundations are built on the shifting sands of a beach, how can you expect it to stay standing until the tides come in?\n Lao Xu stares at me; I stare at the whiteboard; the whiteboard stares at everyone; everyone stares at their phone. We are like a flock of birds lost in fog, constantly drawn to flashing screens until we\u2019ve forgotten the direction we were headed in. Yet, cold night has fallen, and hungry predators are approaching in the dark.\n My phone beeps, indicating that it\u2019s nearly out of battery. My instinctive reaction is not to conserve, but to rush to look through WeChat Moments posted in my network. Every last drop of juice must be used to its fullest extent and not be wasted with invisible background processes. Now you get a glimpse of my values, my philosophy.\n I see the latest posts by Mr. Wan. All of a sudden, the dumpling skin has burst, and the fillings spill out.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d I slam my hand down on the table. Everyone jerks awake from their somnambulant state.\n I hold my phone under Lao Xu\u2019s nose.\n Under Mr. Wan\u2019s profile, he has posted a new photo, accompanied by the following caption:\n On Saturday, the fifteenth of the month under the lunar calendar, I\u2019m going to perform the Buddhist good deed of freeing captive animals on the shore of Wenyu River. I\u2019ll purchase and free river snails laden with eggs, birds, reptiles, fish, and other animals. By this compassionate deed, I hope the Buddha brings blessings to everyone so that the aged may live longer, the middle-aged may have harmonious families, and children may gain wisdom and health! Happy Saturday! (Donations to help purchase more animals to free gratefully accepted: more animals = more good karma for all! Funds may be sent to this account: XXXXXXX. Sharing and reposting this message will also gain you blessings.)\n \u201cErr\u2014I hadn\u2019t realized that they were running so low on funds.\u201d Lao Xu\u2019s eyes are wide as teacups. \u201cThey haven\u2019t paid us our last invoice yet!\u201d\n \u201cKeep on reading,\u201d I say. I continue to slide my finger up the screen. Mr. Wan\u2019s dynamic timeline is woven from high-tech news and pop-Buddhism, a mixture of concentrated caffeine pills and chicken soup for the soul. \u201cI think we\u2019ve discovered his other passion.\u201d\n \u201cSo what?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s think about why, every day, so many people share and forward these posts about how to do good deeds to build up merit and gain the Buddha\u2019s protection. Are they really that faithful? I doubt it. Maybe preventing their photographs from being tempered with isn\u2019t a core need for people, but the anxious contemporary Chinese are obsessed with personal security, especially the psychological sense of being safe. We have to connect Mr. Wan\u2019s product with this psychological need.\u201d\n \u201cBe specific!\u201d\n \u201cEveryone, what kind of posts would you share to feel more secure?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cPowerful mantras!\u201d \u201cPictures of buddhas!\u201d \u201cThe Birthday of the Buddha, and other festival birthdays!\u201d \u201cWise sayings by famous master monks!\u201d\n \u201cWhat sort of posts would make you believe and willingly hand over money?\u201d\n There\u2019s a pause as everyone in the room ponders my question. Then, one of the girls timidly speaks up, \u201cSomething that\u2019s been con\u2026consecrated . . . um, you know, when the light has been\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBingo!\u201d\n The room falls silent. Lao Xu gets up, and, poker-faced, walks behind me. I hear a loud slam, and a chill wind pours into the back of my shirt as though a bucket of ice has been emptied into it. The haze in the room instantly dissipates.\n \u201cAwake now?\u201d Lao Xu closes the window. \u201cExplain what you mean again, but stop being so damned mystical.\u201d\n I hold his gaze and speak slowly. \u201cLet\u2019s find a famous and respected monk to consecrate this app\u2014\u2018bring light into it\u2019\u2014so that every picture it takes becomes a charm to ward off evil. We\u2019ll create a sharing economy of blessings.\u201d\n Everyone shifts their gaze from the phone screen to me; I gaze at Lao Xu; Lao Xu says nothing but gazes at the phone.\n After a while, he lets out a held breath. \u201cYou know, all those rinpoches in Chaoyang District are going to get you for this.\u201d\n I have no idea what\u2019s in store for me.\n 10.\n My wife is a Neo-Luddite.\n Once, she had been a heavy gamer. She spent so much time on the computer that her parents sent her to a summer camp that specialized in curing Internet addiction. The experience caused her attitude toward technology to turn a hundred and eighty degrees.\n Many times I asked her, what really happened in that campground located on Phoenix Mountain called \u201cThe Nirvana Plan\u201d?\n She never answered me directly.\n This was the biggest philosophical difference between us. She believed that despite the appearance of unprecedented novelty, the high-tech industry was ultimately no different from another ancient trade: they both took advantage of the weaknesses of ordinary men and women, and, under the guise of words like \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201cuplift,\u201d and \u201csalvation,\u201d manipulated their emotions. Whether you put your hand on a Bible or an iPad, in the end you were praying to the same god.\n We only give the people what they want. They desire comfort, joy, a sense of security. They want to improve themselves, to see themselves stand out in the crowd. We can\u2019t take such desires away from them. That was how I always argued back at her.\n Oh, please! Don\u2019t give me that. You\u2019re just playing a game to satisfy your own yearning for control, she said.\n Come on, give people a little credit! I said. Everyone\u2019s got a brain. How can anyone \u201ccontrol\u201d anyone else?\n There are always NPCs.\n What are you talking about?\n Non-Player Characters. What if everything is controlled from behind the scenes by some invisible background process? Then every action you take will affect the game logic. The system will react with NPCs and they will carry out their predetermined programming.\n I stared at her face as though I\u2019d never really known her. I even wondered whether she had just joined some new cult.\n You don\u2019t really believe that, do you?\n I\u2019m going to walk the dog. There shouldn\u2019t be much dog poop in the streets this early in the morning.\n 11.\n Every day, as the temple bell tolls five, I have to get up to sweep the grounds. I sweep the wooden floor of the gallery from the new library to the stone steps, and thence to the temple gates, where the ancient pagoda tree grows, its gnarled branches spread like the talons of a rampant beast.\n As for whether I will be quietly reciting the Surangama Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, or the Diamond Sutra as I sweep, that depends on the day\u2019s PM2.5 air quality index. My throat hurts when I breathe the polluted air; I don\u2019t need the distraction.\n Any of the faithful coming to the temple to make offerings can see that I haven\u2019t been truly called by the Buddha. Just like all the other \u201cdisciples\u201d flocking here on weekends to study Buddhist doctrine, I\u2019m here to hide from the real world.\n In a way, I\u2019m not too different from the throngs of shoppers at the Buddhist shop outside Yonghe Lamasery vying to buy electronic \u201cBuddha boxes.\u201d They bring the box home, push a button, and the box starts chanting sutras. On the hour (or at designated times), the box will even emit a tranquil, meditative duannnnng, like the ringing of the bell in a temple. The purchasers apparently think this will bring them blessings and cleanse bad karma. I often imagine all the passengers squeezed like canned sardines into the number 2 subway train leaving from the lamasery station, all of their Buddha boxes ringing harmoniously together on the hour. Perhaps the so-called Chan state of mind refers to the detachment of such a moment from real life.\n And now that I have to commit to a Buddhist vegetarian diet, I miss the restaurant at Beixinqiao where they serve chitterlings soup made from ancient stock that has supposedly been accumulating flavor for years.\n I\u2019ve canceled my mobile number and deleted all my accounts on social media; my wife has left me and returned to her hometown; I\u2019ve even been given a Dharma name: \u201cChenwu\u201d \u2013 \u201cFree of Worldly Dust.\u201d All I want is for those crazy people to never find me again.\n I\u2019ve had enough.\n Everything began that night with the crazy marketing scheme that seemed to make no sense.\n Mr. Wan bought my idea. Overnight he summoned the engineers to develop the new product. Lao Xu laid out the marketing plan and strategy. The most important piece of the project, of course, was assigned to me, the originator.\n I had to go find a respected master monk willing to consecrate our app, to bring it light.\n Lao Xu demanded that the entire process be filmed and turned loose online to go viral. I ran through every excuse I could think of: my family have been Christians for three generations; my wife is pregnant and can\u2019t come in contact with raw foods, animal fur, or anything having to do with spirits\u2026\n Lao Xu responded with only one line: This is your baby. If you don\u2019t want to see it through, get out and don\u2019t come back, you get me?\n I visited every temple in Beijing, begging and pleading with the master monks, and I sought out every lama secluded in spiritual solitude in the city\u2019s various nooks and crannies. Each time, however, even after having come to an agreement on the price, as soon as I brought out my camera, the monks\u2019 faces turned stony, and after a few Amitabhas, they would cover their faces and escape my presence.\n We tried using hidden cameras a few times, but the combination of incense haze and camera shake made the results unwatchable.\n As the deadline approached, I could no longer sleep, but tossed and turned all night. My wife asked me what I was doing.\n \u201cRolling dough for pancakes,\u201d I said.\n She kicked me. \u201cIf you want to do that, get on the floor. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re a rolling pin in bed. I\u2019m trying to sleep.\u201d\n The kick managed to free my clogged neural pathways. Instantly, I was inspired.\n Mr. Wan\u2019s new app went on sale on time. Lao Xu, energized like his Land Rover, shifted into high gear and whipped us into a frenzy. Videos, new concepts, and new campaigns were released one after another. Soon, a video depicting a master monk consecrating a mobile phone went viral, and Buddhagrams began to conquer Weibo and WeChat. The number of downloads and daily engagement level rose exponentially like rockets heading for the clouds at escape velocity.\n Don\u2019t ask me the impact of such growth on the long-term brand value; don\u2019t ask me what this meant for the subsequent development and application of the digital watermark technology. Those are problems Mr. Wan had to solve. I was only a strategist for a third-rate marketing company who had some crazy ideas. I could only work on problems that I was capable of solving with my own methods.\n In the end, we underestimated the creativity of users. It turned out that Buddhagram pictures, due to the presence of the watermark, could be recovered from even low-resolution copies or cropped fragments. This meant they could be shared and forwarded without taking up much bandwidth or time. Trying to take advantage of the situation, we released a series of new ads touting this newly discovered advantage.\n Downloads spiked again, but no one anticipated what happened next.\n It started with a picture of an apple taken with Buddhagram. A week later, the poster shared a second picture of the same apple: it was apparently rotting at a much slower rate than other apples.\n Next came the various pictures of pets that miraculously recovered their health after having had their pictures taken with Buddhagram.\n Then, an old lady claimed that after she had taken a Buddhaselfie, she managed to survive a deadly car accident.\n Rumors multiplied. Taken individually, each seemed some preposterous April Fool\u2019s joke, but behind every story stood a witness who swore it was true, and the number of believers snowballed.\n The posts grew stranger. Patients with terminal cancer posted selfies showing their tumors diminishing daily; couples who had trouble conceiving took nude selfies and became pregnant; migrant laborers took group selfies and won the lottery. The kind of news that one would normally expect to find only on tabloids on the subway filled every social media platform. All the pictures had the Buddhagram watermark, and all of us thought they were from astroturfers hired by the company.\n We thought wrong.\n Supposedly, Mr. Wan\u2019s phone was ringing nonstop with calls from interested investors. Other than asking about a chance to invest, the next most popular question was: Who is the master monk who brought light to the app?\n The logic was simple: if a consecrated mobile app could have such magical effects, then asking the monk himself to perform some rite would surely result in earthshaking miracles. The investors thought of this, and so did millions and millions of users.\n In this age, truth was as rare as virtue. Even more tragic, when faced with the truth, most people preferred to doubt its veracity because they would rather believe the truthy mirage created by their own minds.\n Soon, my contact details were leaked. Email, phone, text . . . everyone screamed the same question at me: Who is the master monk???\n I refused to answer. I knew they would figure it out sooner or later.\n Crowdsourcing the search, they finally managed to locate the master monk and the disciples in the viral video\u2014a bunch of actors my friend had found for me among the crowd of extras congregated at Hengdian World Studios, hoping to get a role. They were supposed to portray commoners during the Qing Dynasty, which meant they were already shaved bald\u2014just like Buddhist monks. This made negotiations rather easy. The extras who harbored dreams of making it big in the movies were especially diligent, and the lead even argued with the makeup artist over the correct placement of the burn marks over his head to indicate his ordained status. Watching the scene, I grew concerned.\n They were all good people. The fault was entirely mine.\n The poor actors who had been located by the \u201chuman flesh search engine\u201d could no longer live in peace. The enraged netizens hounded them and their families using the vilest language, forcing them to acknowledge what was obviously true: they were mere extras hired by the company to portray the master monk and his disciples.\n Except that the crowd still wasn\u2019t quite on the same page as me: they continued to believe that my company\u2014or more precisely, I\u2014was hiding the real master monk. Out of greed or selfishness, I was refusing to disclose his identity to the public so that everyone could benefit from the master\u2019s powers.\n I really wasn\u2019t.\n Lao Xu closed the company temporarily. Every day, groups of middle-aged women congregated at the foot of the building, holding up protest banners. Even if we could endure the pressure, the building\u2019s property manager couldn\u2019t. Lao Xu put us all on paid leave, hoping that the storm would quickly blow over. Kindly, he told me that it was best for me to leave the city and return to my parents\u2019 home for a few days. It was just a matter of time before one of the netizens who was terminally ill might arrive at my door with his family, pleading with me to give up the master monk\u2019s WeChat ID.\n I realized that Lao Xu was right. I couldn\u2019t put my family at risk.\n And so, after I settled my affairs, I came to this ancient temple to become a grounds sweeper.\n The bell tolls nine times, indicating the end of morning lessons. The staff of the temple, including me, assume our positions. The temple is open to the public today, and the abbot, Master Deta, will be greeting a group of VIP faithful from the Internet industry and conducting a salon to discuss the connections between Buddhist doctrine and the Web.\n My assigned job is to hand out the visitor\u2019s badges. On the list of VIPs, I see more than a few familiar names, including Mr. Wan.\n Though it\u2019s thirty-eight degrees Celsius, I put on my cotton medical face mask. Sweat pours off me as though I\u2019m drenched by rain.\n 100.\n The faithful, now dressed in the yellow robes and yellow shoes normally reserved for monks, stream in one after another, their colorful badges swaying on lanyards before their chests. For a moment I suffer the illusion of having returned to my old life from a few months ago: the China National Convention Center, JW Marriott Beijing, 798 D Park . . . I was either at meetings or on my way to meetings, handing out my business card, adding people\u2019s WeChat IDs, puffing up our clients, sketching incredible visions, peppering my speech with \u201cInternet thinking\u201d buzzwords\u2014like some updated version of a Red Guard clutching his Little Red Book.\n The faces before me are still the same, but now their badges have been stripped of the eye-catching titles. \u201cCXO,\u201d \u201cCo-Founder,\u201d and \u201cVP of Investment\u201d have been replaced by \u201cHouseholder,\u201d \u201cBeliever,\u201d and \u201cBenefactor.\u201d At least for the moment, they\u2019ve retracted their typical arrogance and protruding bellies. Mumbling mantras, they take their seats, and piously hand their phones, iPads, Google Glasses, smart wristbands, and so on to the waiting novice monks in exchange for a numbered ticket.\n I see Mr. Wan. His face looks pallid and thin, but his gaze is steady and his steps airy. Placidly, he places the palms of his hands together and bows to the guests on either side of him, showing no trace of his former domineering air. As he passes me, I lower my head, and he lowers his in turn to acknowledge my greeting.\n Many things must have happened in the intervening months.\n Supposedly, Master Deta had once been a promising student at the Computer Science Department of Tsinghua University. However, as a result of his enlightenment, he gave up offers for graduate study at Stanford, Yale, UC Berkley and other ivy-clad campuses, took up vows, and became ordained as a monk. With him as an example, a group of other graduates of elite colleges also joined our temple and began to spread the teachings of Buddhism online, bringing relief to all mortal beings with methods adapted to the Internet age.\n The master\u2019s lecture today roams over many subjects\u2014so many that I barely remember any of them. I do see Mr. Wan holding a pious pose and nodding frequently. When the master discusses how big data techniques could be used to help locate the young reincarnations of tulkus, his eyes even grow tearful.\n I\u2019m trying to hide from him, but I also can\u2019t suppress the urge to go up to him and ask if the storm has finally blown over. I don\u2019t miss my old life, but I miss my family.\n Here, only monks who have achieved a certain status have the right to use the Internet. The layered green branches of the ancient cypress grove, like a firewall, separate us from the noise and dust of the secular world. My daily life, however, is not boring at all: sweeping, working, chanting, debating, and copying. Uncluttered by material possessions, I\u2019ve been sleeping without trouble for the first time in years, and no longer live in constant dread of sudden vibrations from my phone\u2014though occasionally my right quadriceps still suffers phantom pulses. But my teacher tells me that if I count my prayer beads\u2014all one thousand and eight hundred of them\u2014every day for a hundred eighty days, I shall be fully cured.\n I think it\u2019s because we want too much, more than what our bodies and minds are designed to withstand.\n My old job was all about creating need, encouraging people to pursue things that didn\u2019t matter for their lives, and then I used the money they gave in exchange to purchase illusions others had created for me. Round after round, we never seemed to tire of the game.\n I think about my wife\u2019s words: Her son is such a pushover he might as well be a baby. Fuck, I\u2019m even more useless than a baby.\n This is my sin, my bad karma, the blockage I need to clear for my progress.\n I\u2019m starting to understand Mr. Wan.\n After the lecture, Mr. Wan and a few others surround Master Deta, apparently because they have many questions that need his insight. Master Deta beckons to me. I gird myself and walk over.\n \u201cWould you bring these honored guests to meditation room three? I\u2019ll be over in a moment.\u201d\n I nod, and lead the group to the room in the back reserved for VIPs.\n I ask them to sit, and I pour tea for everyone. They nod and smile at each other, but their conversation is restricted to small talk. I\u2019m guessing that they are competitors outside the temple.\n Mr. Wan doesn\u2019t look at me directly. He sips his tea and closes his eyes, meditating. His lips move as he silently recites some mantra, and his hands are busy with a string of rosewood prayer beads. After the forty-ninth time through the beads, I can\u2019t hold myself back any longer. I walk up to him, bend down, and whisper next to his ear, \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n Mr. Wan opens his eyes and scrutinizes me for half a minute. \u201cYou are Zhou . . . \u201d\n \u201cZhou Chongbo. You have excellent memory, sir.\u201d\n Mr. Wan grimaces and lunges at me, wrapping the string of prayer beads about my neck and pushing me to the floor.\n \u201cYou fucking idiot!\u201d He curses and strikes me. The two guests next to him stand up, startled, but they don\u2019t dare to intervene. \u201cAmitabha. Amitabha,\u201d they murmur.\n I protect my face with my hands, but I don\u2019t know what to say. \u201cMercy!\u201d I cry. \u201cMercy!\u201d\n \u201cStop!\u201d Master Deta\u2019s voice booms. \u201cThis is a sanctified place! Such violence has no place here.\u201d\n Mr. Wan\u2019s fist, suspended in midair, stops. He stares at me, and tears suddenly spill from them and fall onto my face, as though he\u2019s the one wronged.\n \u201cAll gone . . . I\u2019ve lost everything . . . \u201d he murmurs. Then he falls back into his seat.\n I get up. I guess someone who\u2019s lost everything can\u2019t even strike very hard. My body isn\u2019t hurting at all.\n \u201cAmitabha.\u201d I put my palms together and bow to him. I know he\u2019s not feeling much better compared to me. Just as I\u2019m about to leave the meditation room, the abbot stops me, and strikes me with his ferule: twice on the left shoulder, once on the right.\n \u201cDon\u2019t discuss what happened today with others. You still have too much worldly arrogance about you and cannot handle important tasks. You must study harder and reflect on your actions.\u201d\n I\u2019m about to argue the point but then remember that I once tolerated much worse from Lao Xu and Mr. Wan. Master Deta is basically the temple\u2019s CEO. I have to swallow my pride.\n I bow to him and back out.\n I lean against the wall of the gallery and watch the woods in the setting sun. Smog glistens above the city like the piled layers of a sari. The bell tolls on the hour, and startled birds take to the air.\n A thought flashes through my mind. I am reminded of how Master Subhuti once struck Monkey three times on the head with a ferule and then walked away with his hands held behind him, which was a message for Monkey to come to the backdoor of the master\u2019s bedroom at the hour of the third watch for special lessons.\n But how am I supposed to interpret two strikes on the left shoulder and one on the right?\n 101.\n At around nine o\u2019clock at night\u2014that\u2019s when first watch turns to second watch under the ancient time system\u2014I head for the abbot\u2019s chambers via backwoods trails. My journey through the dark woods is accompanied only by the gentle susurration of pines, with not even a chirp from a bird.\n I knock twice on the door, and then once. Someone seems to be stirring inside. I knock again. The door opens automatically.\n Abbot Deta is sitting with his back to the door. Before him is a giant screen, completely dark. I seem to hear the low-frequency buzzing of electronics. He sighs loudly.\n \u201cTeacher! Your student is here!\u201d I fall to my knees and prepare to kowtow.\n \u201cI think you\u2019ve read Journey to the West too many times.\u201d The abbot gets up, and I can see that his expression isn\u2019t one of joy. \u201cI told you to come at one minute past ten o\u2019clock.\u201d\n I\u2019m stumped for words. Apparently the master was using binary notation.\n I hurry to hide my embarrassment. \u201cUm . . . this afternoon\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault; I know what happened. As soon as you stepped into this temple, I learned everything about you.\u201d\n \u201c\u2026 then why did you accept me?\u201d\n \u201cThough your heart wasn\u2019t directed towards the Buddha, you have within you the root of wisdom. If I didn\u2019t take you in, I\u2019m afraid you might have sought refuge in suicide.\u201d\n \u201cMaster is indeed merciful.\u201d I\u2019m still completely as a loss.\n \u201cI know you don\u2019t understand.\u201d Master Deta isn\u2019t actually that old. He\u2019s barely in his forties. As he laughs with his glasses perched on his nose, he resembles a college professor.\n \u201cForgive your foolish student, master. Please enlighten me.\u201d\n Master Deta waves his hand. The giant screen, apparently controlled by body motion, lights up. The image on the screen is difficult to describe: a gigantic, compressed oval whose background is various shades of blue, studded with irregular patches of orange-red dots. Or maybe it\u2019s the other way around. I think the image resembles the false-color version of some planet\u2019s topographic map, or maybe a slide full of multiplying mold seen through a microscope.\n \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n \u201cThe universe. Or more precisely, the cosmic microwave background. This is the image of the universe about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. You\u2019re looking at the most precise photograph of it so far.\u201d His enthusiastic admiration contrasts sharply with his humble monk\u2019s garb.\n \u201cUm . . . \u201d\n \u201cThis was made by computation based on the data gathered by the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck space observatory. Look here, and here\u2014do you see how the pattern is a bit odd? . . . \u201d\n Other than patches of orange-red or cobalt mold, I can\u2019t see what\u2019s so special.\n \u201cAre you saying that . . . um . . . the Buddha doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d I ask tentatively.\n \u201cThe Buddha teaches that the great trichiliocosm consists of a billion worlds.\u201d He glares at me, as though forcing me to retract my words. \u201cThis picture proves that multiple universes once existed. After so many years of effort, humanity finally proved, through technology, the Buddhist cosmology.\u201d\n I should have realized this would happen. The abbot is just like the pyramid schemers in Zhongguancun\u2014anything, no matter how unrelated, could be seen by them as powerful proof for their point of view. I try to imagine how a Christian might interpret this picture.\n \u201cAmitabha.\u201d I put my palms together to show piety.\n \u201cThe question is: why has the Buddha chosen now to reveal the truth to all of humanity?\u201d He speaks slowly and forcefully. \u201cI pondered this question for a long time, but then I saw your scheme.\u201d\n \u201cBuddhagram?\u201d\n Master Deta nods. \u201cI can\u2019t say I approve of your methods. However, since you ended up coming here, that proves that my guesses were correct.\u201d\n Cold sweat seeps onto the skin at my back, not unlike that night so long ago that it seems unreal.\n \u201cThis world is no longer the same as its original form. Put it another way: its creator, the Buddha, God, Deity\u2014no matter what name you give it, has changed the rules by which the world operates. Do you really believe that the consecration was what allowed Buddhagram to perform miracles?\u201d\n I hold my breath.\n \u201cSuppose the universe is a program. Everything that we can observe is the result of the machine-executable code. But the cosmic microwave background can be understood as the record of some earlier version of the source code. We can invoke this code via computation, which means that we can also use algorithmic processing to change the version of the code that\u2019s currently running.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re saying that Mr. Wan\u2019s algorithm really caused all of this?\u201d\n \u201cI dare not jump to conclusions. But if you forced me to guess, that would be it.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m pretty science-illiterate, master. Please don\u2019t joke with me.\u201d\n \u201cAmitabha. I am a Technologist-Buddhist. I believe in the words of Arthur C. Clarke: \u2018Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable at first glance from Buddhist magic.\u2019\u201d\n I know there\u2019s something not quite right here, but I don\u2019t know how to debate him. \u201cBut . . . but that project failed. Look at what a sad state Mr. Wan is in. I don\u2019t think I have anything more to do with this.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is not real? That which form possesses.\n The Tathagata will be seen\n When mind past form progresses.\u201d\n \u201cMaster, please allow me to leave the temple and return to the secular world. I miss my wife.\u201d A nameless fear suddenly seizes me like a bottomless pit rising out of the screen on the wall, trying to pull me in.\n Master Deta sighs and smiles wryly, as though he has long since predicted all this.\n \u201cI was hoping that by studying Buddhist doctrine with me, you would be sufficiently calmed to stay here and wait out the catastrophe. But . . . you and I are both caught in the wheel of samsara, so how can we escape our destinies? All right. Take this as a memento of our time together.\u201d\n He hands over a gold-colored Buddha card. On the back is a toll-free number as well as a VIP account number and security code.\n \u201cTeacher, what is this?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t lose it! The resale value of this card is 8888 yuan. If anything happens, you can give me a call.\u201d\n Master Deta turns and waves his hand, and the moldy image on the screen is replaced by regular TV programming. An American quantum physicist has been killed by gunshot. Bizarrely, the shooter claims that it was an accident because he thought the victim was someone else.\n 110.\n Half a year passes. I meet Lao Xu at Guanji Chiba, a popular barbecue restaurant in Zhongguancun.\n Lao Xu hasn\u2019t changed much. He\u2019s still pathologically in love with barbecued lamb kidneys. Like a stereotypical Northeasterner, after a few bottles of beer, his face glowing with grease and jittering with emotion, Lao Xu begins to say what\u2019s really on his mind.\n \u201cChongbo, why don\u2019t you come and join me again? You know I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d\n Animatedly, Lao Xu tells me what\u2019s been going on with him, spewing flecks of spittle through the smoky haze. After he hid and rested for a while at home, another phone call drew him back into the IT world. This time, he didn\u2019t start a marketing company with no future, but became an \u201cangel investor.\u201d With all the contacts he made among entrepreneurs, now he gets to spend other people\u2019s money\u2014the faster the better.\n He thinks I have potential.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Mr. Wan?\u201d I change the subject. My wife has just found out that she\u2019s pregnant. Although my current job is boring, it\u2019s stable. Lao Xu, on the other hand, isn\u2019t.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him for a while\u2026\u201d Lao Xu\u2019s eyes dimmed, and he took a long drag on his cigarette. \u201cFortune is so fickle. Back when Buddhagram was on fire, a whole bunch of companies wanted to invest. An American company even wanted to talk about purchasing the whole company. But at the last minute, an American man showed up claiming that Y\u2019s core algorithm was stolen from one of his graduate school research labmates. The American sued, and he just wouldn\u2019t let it go. So the patent rights had to be temporarily frozen. All the investors scattered to the wind, and Lao Wan had to sell everything he owned . . . but in the end, it still wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n I drain my cup.\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Lao Xu said. \u201cHonestly, if you hadn\u2019t come up with that idea, I bet Lao Wan would have failed even earlier.\u201d\n \u201cBut if they hadn\u2019t made Buddhagram, maybe the Americans wouldn\u2019t have found out about the stolen algorithm.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve finally got it figured out. If what happened hadn\u2019t happened, something else would have. That\u2019s what fate means. Later, I heard that the labmate Y stole from was shot and killed in America. So now the patent case is in limbo.\u201d\n Lao Xu\u2019s voice seems to drone on while time stands frozen. My gaze penetrates the slight crack between his cigarette-holding fingers, and the background of noisy, smoky, shouting, drinking patrons of the restaurant fades into the distance. I remember something, something so important that I\u2019ve managed to forget it completely until now.\n I thought everything was over, but it\u2019s only starting.\n After saying goodbye to Lao Xu, I return home and begin to search, turning everything in the house upside down. My wife, her belly protruding, asks me if I\u2019ve had too much to drink.\n \u201cHave you seen a golden card with a picture of the Buddha on there?\u201d I ask her. \u201cThere\u2019s a toll-free number on the back.\u201d\n She looks at me pitifully, as though gazing at an abandoned Siberian husky, a breed known for its stupidity and difficulty in being trained. She turns away to continue her pregnancy yoga exercises.\n In the end, I find it tucked away inside a fashion magazine in the bathroom. The page I open to happens to be the picture of a Vaseline-covered, nude starlet lounging amongst a pile of electronics. Each screen in the image reflects a part of her glistening body.\n I dial the number and enter the VIP account number and security code. A familiar voice, sounding slightly tired, answers.\n \u201cMaster Deta, it\u2019s me! Chenwu!\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cChenwu! Secular name Zhou Chongbo! Remember how you struck my shoulders three times and told me to go to your room at ten-oh-one to view the picture of the cosmic microwave background?\u201d\n \u201cEr . . . you make it sound so odd. Yes, I do remember you. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d\n \u201cYou were right! The problem is with the algorithm!\u201d I take a deep breath and quickly recount the story as well as give him my guess. Someone is working really hard to prevent this algorithm from being put into wide application, even to the point of killing people.\n The earpiece of the phone is silent for a long while, and then I hear another long sigh.\n \u201cYou still don\u2019t get it. Do you play games?\u201d\n \u201cA long time ago. Do you mean arcade, handheld, or consoles?\u201d\n \u201cWhatever. If your character attacks a big boss, the game\u2019s algorithms usually summons all available forces to its defense, right?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean the NPCs?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do anything! All I did was to suggest a stupid fucking marketing plan!\u201d\n \u201cYou misunderstand.\u201d Master Deta\u2019s voice becomes low and somber, as though he\u2019s about to lose his patience. \u201cYou\u2019re not the player who\u2019s attacking the boss. You\u2019re just an NPC.\u201d\n \u201cWait a second! You are saying . . . \u201d Suddenly my thoughts turned jumbled and slow, like a bowl of sticky rice porridge.\n \u201cI know it\u2019s hard to accept, but it\u2019s the truth. Someone, or maybe some group, has done things that threaten the entire program\u2014the stability of our universe. And so the system, following designated routines, has invoked the NPCs to carry out its order to eliminate the threat and maintain the consistency of the universe.\u201d\n \u201cBut I did everything on my own! I just wanted to do my job and earn a living. I thought I was helping him.\u201d\n \u201cAll NPCs think like that.\u201d\n \u201cSo what should I do? Lao Xu wants me to go work for him. How do I know if this is . . . Are you there?\u201d\n Strange noises are coming out of the earpiece, as though a thousand insect legs are scrabbling against the microphone.\n \u201cWhen you are confused . . . hiss . . . the teacher helps . . . Enlightened . . . hiss . . . help yourself. All you have to do . . . hiss . . . and that\u2019s it\u2026 hiss . . . Sorry, your VIP account balance is insufficient. Please refill your account and dial again. Sorry, . . . \u201d\n \u201cFuck!\u201d I hang up angrily.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, screaming like that? If you frighten me and cause me to miscarry, are you going to assume the responsibility?\u201d My wife\u2019s voice drifts to me slowly from the bedroom.\n In three seconds, I sort though my thoughts and decide to tell her everything. Of course, I do have to limit it to the parts she can understand.\n \u201cTell Lao Xu that your wife is worried about earning good karma for the baby. She doesn\u2019t want you to follow him and continue to do unethical work.\u201d\n I\u2019m just about to argue with her when the phone rings again. Lao Xu.\n \u201cHave you made up your mind? USTC\u2019s quantum lab is making rapid progress! Their machine is tackling the NP-completeness problem now. Once they\u2019ve proved that P=NP, do you realize what that means?\u201d\n I look at my wife. She places the edge of her palm against her throat and makes a slicing motion, and then she sticks her tongue out.\n \u201cHello? You there? Do you know what that means\u2014\u201d I hang up, and Lao Xu\u2019s voice lingers in my ear.\n Every program has bugs. In this universe, I\u2019m pretty sure that my wife is one of them. Possible the most fatal one.\n 111.\n I still remember the day when Lailai was born: rose-colored skin, his whole body smelling of milk. He\u2019s the most beautiful baby I\u2019ve ever seen.\n My wife, still weak from labor, asked me to come up with a good name. I agreed. But really, I was thinking: It really makes no difference what he\u2019s named.\n I\u2019m no hero. I\u2019m just an NPC. To tell the truth, I\u2019ve never believed that all this was my fault. I didn\u2019t join Lao Xu; I didn\u2019t come up with some outrageous idea that would have caused the whole project to fail; I didn\u2019t prevent that stupid quantum computer from proving that P=NP\u2014even now I still don\u2019t know what that fucking means.\n If this is the reason that the universe is collapsing, then all I can say is that the Programmer is incompetent. Why regret destroying such a shitty world?\n But I\u2019m holding my baby son, his tiny fist enclosed in my hand, and all I want is for time to stop forever, right now.\n I regret everything I\u2019ve done, or maybe everything I haven\u2019t done.\n In these last few minutes, a scene from long ago appears in my mind: that guy wearing the army coat on the pedestrian overpass.\n He\u2019s staring at me and my wife, and like some stuck answering machine, he says, \u201cThe Quadrantid meteor shower will come on January 4. Don\u2019t miss it . . . \u201d\n No one is going to miss this grand ceremony for going offline.\n I play with my son, trying to make him laugh, or make any sort of expression. Suddenly, I see a reflection in his eyes, rapidly growing in size.\n It\u2019s the light coming from behind me.\n Originally published in Chinese in Offline Magazine, February 2015.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n Chen Qiufan was born in 1981, in Shantou, China.

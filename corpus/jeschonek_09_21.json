I love when they spray the green gas that makes me work harder, or the purple gas that makes the daydreams come.\n But the needles are the most magic part of the dog. Just ask anyone.\n One minute, I\u2019m collapsed on the concrete floor of my bin, exhausted from another triple shift of Playtime. The next minute, ol\u2019 Wazoo is scuttling over to me on his six spiny black legs, barking sweetly.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Right away, as tired as I am, I\u2019m smiling again. I can\u2019t help it. My pup always takes good care of me.\n As his glossy black face gazes down at me, shiny silver needles poke out from the hundreds of facets in his big, bulbous eyes. When he leans closer, they jab into my nose, and I smell his voice in my mind, singing a story of very strong perfume like the scent given off by rotting flesh. Can there be anything more soothing to a ten-year-old boy like me, living with the perfect dog in the paradise of Beastbless, in the parish of Menagerie?\n Among dog lovers, this is what we call a good nose-lick. And it is enough, all alone, to make life worth living.\n Do you know how lucky I am to have a dog at all? Or a dog as great as Wazoo? My same-aged friend, Incompleta, would do anything to have Wazoo or any dog like him.\n This morning, she reminds me again. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to trade your dog for my breakfast, Beneathy?\u201d\n \u201cThanks, but I already have breakfast.\u201d From across the gray table where we eat alongside dozens of fellow Playtimers, I hold up my bowl of delicious red morning clay, sweetened with a garnish of baby chicks. As adorable as they are delicious, the chicks\u2019 tiny black bodies scurry around on eight spindly legs, trying to avoid my white plastic spoon.\n \u201cI have another idea.\u201d She reaches back over her right shoulder, and two long, rust-colored antennae brush her hand. \u201cWe could trade my pet for your pet.\u201d The body of a young kitten flows over her shoulder, hundreds of tiny legs flickering under its segmented scarlet shell. The body just keeps coming, wrapping around her three times like a gleaming stole.\n \u201cLovebite is adorable.\u201d I reach over to pet the kitten\u2019s smooth head, laughing as it snaps at me with its jagged pincers.\n Incompleta puts her hand under the kitten\u2019s mouth, which disgorges a glob of lumpy green ooze. \u201cJust listen to her purr.\u201d\n \u201cI hear it,\u201d I tell her, and I do. Screee snap shrreee snap screeee. \u201cWhat a beautiful sound,\u201d I say, though I still believe there\u2019s nothingas sweet as the bark of a dog. \u201cAre you serious about trading her? Why would you ever giveher up?\u201d\n \u201cBecause dogs are just the best.\u201d Her freckled face reddens as she stares at Wazoo, who then scuttles down off my back and under the table. Lovebite\u2019s tail scrolls around Incompleta\u2019s head, little legs fluttering through her short red hair. \u201cAnd yours is the best ever.\u201d\n She\u2019s right about that. Smiling, I reach under the table to feel Wazoo\u2019s bristly proboscis quivering, making my fingertips sticky. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I ever lost him; I can hardly remember what life was like before I got him.\n \u201cSo will you trade him for my kitty?\u201d asks Incompleta.\n \u201cNo way.\u201d I smile as Wazoo hops and barks, bumping the underside of the table. K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Incompleta sighs. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t, either. Especially with the dog shortage going on.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage?\u201d I spoon scuttling baby chicks and red clay into my mouth and chew.\n \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d As Incompleta eats the lumpy green ooze, her darling Lovebite rears its head up and jabs a clear spike into the soft spot on top of her skull, sipping pink fluid from her head. I\u2019m a little jealous; as great as dogs are, a cat can still be pretty cute when it\u2019s bonding with its owner. \u201cAnd you better keep a close eye on your dog if you don\u2019t want to end up at the Pet Pageant empty-handed.\u201d\n I think about the Pet Pageant a lot during Playtime. It helps take my mind off the screaming things on the Funsembly Line as my fellow Playtimers and I make them extra Beautiful and Happy.\n The Pageant happens in less than a week. People and pets from all over Beastbless and the parish of Menagerie will be there, competing to take home awards for Best Bark, Best Fetch, Best Lick, Best Chew, and more. But only one animal will win the title of Doggiest Dogaroonie, Prince of Pups\u2014and I\u2019m hoping that dog will be Wazoo.\n \u201cHey, Beneathy!\u201d Caustico, the tall, blond boy on the other side of the belt jabs the tip of his bloody Plaything at the screamer sliding slowly between us. \u201cYou missed one!\u201d\n Snapping out of my reverie, I instantly spot what he\u2019s talking about and jump to fix it. The screamer shrieks at the top of his lungs as I leave my playful mark on his belly, getting him ready for the next level of the Playtime game.\n \u201cYou wanna win this time, or not?\u201d snaps Caustico.\n \u201cSure I do.\u201d\n \u201cThen pay attention.\u201d Caustico flicks blood at me from his Plaything. It will blend right in with my red coveralls and the other blood already soaked into them. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be on the same team, remember?\u201d He puts down the Plaything and reaches for a Joy Stick, its barbed tip cherry-red and smoking.\n \u201cI will, I will.\u201d Even as I say it, my mind drifts back to the only thing Ireally want to win. I imagine my wonderful dog atop the Hill of Buddies, barking and flashing his glossy black wings as the top judge drapes a gold medal around his proboscis. I can just see Wazoo flapping up into the air and flying victory laps above the crowd, that beautiful medal swinging and glinting in the sunlight.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n On the front of the gleaming gold medal is the image of a dog\u2019s face, complete with multifaceted eyes with needles jutting out of each facet. Two words are emblazoned around the edge of the medal, following the curved edge:\n Doggiest Dogaroonie.\n I see a date, too, and the name of the winner, and I feel a rush of joyful warmth from head to toe. As wonderful as every day of my life is, as lucky as I have always been to be alive and here, this one thing is what I most long to see.\n According to the medal in my daydream, the name of the winning dog is Wazoo, and this year is when he will win the title of Doggiest Dogaroonie.\n The bunnies are biting outside when I take Wazoo for a walk after Playtime. Clouds of them swirl around us, tiny dark flecks getting in my eyes and nipping at my skin\u2014making me smile with each tiny bite, because who doesn\u2019t love bunnies and their tender little kisses?\n Wazoo, as usual, scuttles back and forth before me, probing black masses and smears left behind by other pets on the sidewalk. Once in a while, he gets excited and pops out his wings, shooting pink mist from the special white nozzles exposed along his back. The mist, which smells sweet like burning plastic and drying paint, always makes me feel a little tipsy when I get a whiff of it.\n Suddenly, Wazoo stops zigzagging and bolts off the sidewalk on a beeline. He drags me along behind him through the brush, holding on to his prickly leash for dear life.\n \u201cWhat are you doing, boy?\u201d I duck out of the way of a low-hanging branch that narrowly misses my head. \u201cWhere are you going?\u2019\u201d\n Wazoo, who has never done anything like this before, answers by buzz-snorting and picking up speed, rushing even more recklessly onward. I stumble on a rock, then trip on a root, nearly going down both times\u2014but miraculously stay on my feet.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Wazoo\u2019s barks get louder the farther off-trail we go. The loudest comes when he hurtles into a clearing and stops. When I stumble in behind him, I see why.\n Wazoo isn\u2019t a big fan of complete strangers, and the clearing is full of them. Three cops in standard gray uniforms encircle a crouching man and a little boy, younger than me, on his knees.\n When the cops hear us, they move apart enough for me to see that the boy is crying and cradling something in his arms . . . something so misshapen, I can\u2019t figure out what it is.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n I\u2019ve never heard Wazoo bark like that before, like some kind of broken machine. His wings unfold, and he takes to the air; I have to let go of the leash as he flies circles around the strangers in the clearing.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d The words rush out of me, though I feel like I\u2019m intruding.\n The boy\u2019s face is wet with tears and smudged with black as he looks up at me. Moving closer, I see by the fading light that his arms are full of broken pieces of something black and shiny. Multicolored fluids drip from his elbows and run down his knees, pooling in the dirt.\n His father drops a hand on his shoulder, but the boy only sobs harder. \u201cW-who would do something like this?\u201d The boy asks the question as if Iknow the answer. \u201cWho would k-kill my sweet Gilgamog?\u201d\n Only when he says it and holds out the broken pieces do I realize what has happened here. Only then do I understand what has been in his arms since before I arrived.\n And my heart sinks. My belly twists, and I want to run away that very second. \u201cYour poor dog . . . \u201d\n \u201cI lovedher with all my h-heart,\u201d says the boy. \u201cAnd now somebody k-killed her!\u201d\n \u201cSomebody or something,\u201d corrects one of the cops, a male.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know which one yet,\u201d says a female cop.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The boy slumps to the ground on his side, still clutching the broken pieces of his beloved dog. His voice grows soft as he shivers with sobs. \u201cShe\u2019s d-dead. My dog is d-dead.\u201d\n Meanwhile, Wazoo keeps circling overhead, making that new sound as he passes.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n People say the world would be a dark and awful place without the Nylon Knights around to keep it bright. Seeing them ride into town the next morning atop their handsome steeds, I believe it.\n The seven men and women ride tall in the saddle, clad in gleaming white plastic armor from head to toe. The long lances they carry are just as perfectly white, and so are the saddles they sit on. Proud and strong, the Knights stare straight ahead, fixed on their mission with unwavering focus.\n Their legendary horses are just as impressive. Their long green bodies clamber down the street, perfectly balanced and nimble on slender legs, though they hardly look sturdy enough to carry the weight of armored riders. With spiny forelegs always folded, they look like they\u2019re constantly begging or praying\u2014though the truth is, those legs can swing and clamp suddenly in time of battle.\n Who could resist running over to touch such beautiful animals? Not me. Along with a dozen other young Playtimers, I hurry over on the way to the Funsembly Line and pet the bright green hide of the closest horse. The hide is one of the nicest things I\u2019ve ever touched, studded with points and bumps and jagged burrs that prick my skin and draw blood. It feels so good, I could gladly pet it for the rest of the day, if I had time.\n HSSSSS. As the horse whinnies, its triangular head spins around, and its big green eyes look my way. HSSSKLAK.\n \u201cThey\u2019re so pretty!\u201d Incompleta is beside me, stroking the leafy green folds of the horse\u2019s wing. \u201cI wish I had a pony like this!\u201d\n \u201cIs there any animal you don\u2019t want?\u201d I ask her.\n \u201cA giraffe, maybe,\u201d she tells me. \u201cToo many fangs and too much venom, you know?\u201d\n Just then, the knight spurs the horse, and it trots out of reach. We move on to the next in line, which turns out to have an even nicer hide. Two strokes along its leg, and my hand is speckled with blood.\n Impetuous as ever, Incompleta shouts up at the Nylon Knight. \u201cWhy are you here? Is it because of the dog killer?\u201d\n The Knight, a woman, judging from the cut of its armor, glances down at us. Two eyes glow bright red from the darkness under her visor\u2014and then a third glows bright yellow between them. \u201cCurfew begins now.\u201d Her voice is a droning monotone. \u201cProceed to your Playhouse and lock yourselves inside until further notice.\u201d\n \u201cDo you know who\u2019s taking and killing the pets?\u201d asks Incompleta. \u201cDo you know where to find him?\u201d\n \u201cInformation later,\u201d says the Knight. \u201cCurfew begins now.\u201d With that, she spurs her horse, which rears up and whinnies before galloping off with the rest of the team.\n HSSSSS. HSSSKLAK.\n Incompleta sighs. \u201cI want a pony more than ever now.\u201d\n \u201cHave you ever thought of becoming a Nylon Knight?\u201d I ask as Wazoo scuttles up between us. \u201cThen you\u2019d get a pony for sure.\u201d\n \u201cOnly if I get to keep Lovebite.\u201d She pats her shoulder, and the long red kitten crawls up her back from under her shirt and wraps itself around her head like a multi-legged, segmented turban. \u201cAnd a dog like Wazoo, of course. And maybe a giraffe, after all. Wearing a Knight\u2019s super-hard plastic armor would make its poisonous fangs easier to deal with, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n There\u2019s no law against leaving Playtime early because who would want to? The Funsembly Line is just what the name says\u2014funto the max.\n But today, for the first time in my life, leaving early is exactly what I do. I leave three hours early, believe it or not.\n And it\u2019s all because of Incompleta and her cat.\n \u201cBeneathy! You\u2019ve got to help me!\u201d She dashes into the room in a frantic state, eyes wide and hair wild. \u201cLovebite is gone!\u201d\n I admit, I\u2019m annoyed at the interruption. The screamer on the belt is in peak shriek, and I\u2019ve got a fired-up Joy Stick with his name on it. \u201cGone?\u201d\n \u201cShe slipped away somehow!\u201d Incompleta grabs my sleeve. \u201cI was busy playing and only just noticed.\u201d\n \u201cWhere could she have gone?\u201d\n \u201cAnywhere! You know how cats are!\u201d She shakes my arm roughly, oblivious to all the Playtimers who are staring our way. \u201cPlease, Beneathy! Help me find her!\u201d\n The screamer\u2019s going berserk. I have to finish him ASAP or someone else will get to have all the fun. \u201cShe\u2019s probably just somewhere in the Playhouse.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not,\u201d snaps Incompleta. \u201cI\u2019ve looked everywhere. She has to be outside. Maybe she sneaked out through a vent or a crack or something.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s fine.\u201d I shrug off her hand and turn back to the screamer, raising the Joy Stick over his already-flaming navel. \u201cCats can take care of themselves pretty well.\u201d\n That\u2019s the last straw for Incompleta. With a loud grunt, she knocks the stick from my hand, seizes my arm, and drags me away from the Funsembly Line.\n I try to pull away, but she\u2019s got a firm grip. Other Playtimers look like they think about helping me, but none of them do.\n When we get to the doorway, I grab hold of the jamb and fight, determined to stay put. She responds by swinging me around against the wall and getting up in my face.\n \u201cWhat if it was your pet who was missing?\u201d Even as she hisses out the words, Wazoo scurries around us, bumping our legs and barking. \u201cWould you do nothing and just hope he came back?\u201d\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Wazoo\u2019s barks change my mind. So does the memory of the kid from the clearing the night before, the one crying over the broken corpse of the dog called Gilgamog.\n Incompleta is right.\n I shake my head and stop fighting. \u201cCan somebody cover for me? I need to go look for a cat.\u201d\n \u201cSure!\u201d Caustico\u2019s only too happy to take my place. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the Nylon Knights make exceptions to the curfew for cat-finders.\u201d\n \u201cHere, Kitty Kitty!\u201d calls Incompleta as we wander the forest of Beastbless. \u201cCome to Mama, little Lovebite!\u201d\n The noise makes me nervous. I keep looking around, worried that the Nylon Knights might hear and punish us for breaking curfew . . . or worse, that the pet killer might decide to kill something other than pets. Sneaking out of the Playhouse might not have been the smartest move we\u2019ve ever made.\n Though of course I want to find Lovebite, too. I can\u2019t stand the thought of any pet owner, especially a fellow Playtimer, going without the sweet companion that makes life worth living.\n \u201cLovebite!\u201d My calls aren\u2019t as loud, but at least I bring another helper to the search. Antennae wiggling, Wazoo crashes through the brush by my side, snuffling at the vegetation with his bristly proboscis. If there\u2019s one thing a dog\u2019s good at, it\u2019s hunting down a cat.\n \u201cWhere is she?\u201d Incompleta stomps her foot in frustration. \u201cWe keep getting farther from the Playhouse, and there\u2019s still no sign of her!\u201d\n \u201cChasing a mouse, probably. Cats can\u2019t resist the claws and stingers on those things.\u201d I push through a patch of waist-high weeds, but nothing jumps out at me. Nothing much interests Wazoo, either.\n \u201cWhat if the killer got her?\u201d Incompleta sounds panicky, and her eyes well up with tears. \u201cWhat if the reason she\u2019s not coming to me is that she\u2019s dead?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s fine. Cats have nine lives, don\u2019t they?\u201d I smile her way with a confidence I don\u2019t really feel.\n But it\u2019s hard to keep up a good front as we search further without success. Either Lovebite\u2019s a great hider, a fast traveler, or something\u2019s happened to her\u2014an accident or attack by another animal, if not the pet killer.\n Suddenly, though, Incompleta gets excited. She ducks down at the base of a big tree and picks up a bloody mass of fluff and feathers.\n \u201cLook, Beneathy! I\u2019d recognize this dead goldfish anywhere! It\u2019s the work of my sweet little Lovebite!\u201d\n Just then, we hear a loud animal cry from nearby, followed by the sound of thrashing through the brush, moving rapidly away.\n Without a word or hesitation, Incompleta leaps up and bolts away in the direction of the thrashing. I\u2019m about to race off after her when I have a sudden change of plan.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Barking his head off, Wazoo charges in the opposite direction, running so hard that he snaps his leash. Whatever he\u2019s after, I can\u2019t see or even hear it.\n But what if he\u2019s heading into danger?\n I hesitate for an instant, looking one way and then the other. Wazoo and Incompleta might both need my help. Which one do I go after?\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n As soon as I hear that sound, the one Wazoo made at the scene of the other dog\u2019s murder, my mind is made up. I run after him as fast as I can, leaving Incompleta to her own devices.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n But as I run, and Wazoo keeps making those sounds, I wish I\u2019d brought a Joy Stick from the Playhouse or something else I could use as a weapon. I\u2019m just so used to a world where pets aren\u2019t killed, and the only Playtime happens on the Funsembly Line, I didn\u2019t even think about it.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n Bzzzzeeeeeekkk.\n But I\u2019m thinking about it now. As I burst into a thicket of trees and see Wazoo face-to-face with some kind of monster, I\u2019m thinking about it hard.\n Because the monster, with its four legs, long tail, and mottled brown and black fur, is crouching, baring its gleaming white fangs, and making a noise deep in its throat that can mean only one thing.\n Grrrrrrrrrrr.\n And that one thing is Playtime, monster style.\n Ears flattened back against its head, the monster snaps its jaws and lets loose an unholy howl.\n Raarrrr.\n My heart\u2019s pounding, my hands are shaking\u2014but Wazoo is unfazed. Fanning out his black wings, he roars at the monster with more menace than I\u2019ve ever seen him muster.\n SCREEE KLAK EEEE AAARRKK.\n The monster lunges, snapping and howling with wild ferocity.\n RAARRRR RARRRR RARRRRR.\n Instead of backing down, Wazoo lunges at the monster, spraying green gas from one nozzle and black from another. The monster lurches back, coughing and shaking its head hard.\n Wazoo presses the attack, unleashing more plumes of gas. His opponent coughs harder than ever and stumbles back on shaky legs, his savagery flagging.\n Just as I cheer in my heart, however, things suddenly change. Loud, heavy footfalls pound toward us, accompanied by violent thrashing. Another monster explodes into the thicket, much bigger than the first\u2014a four-legged beast taller than I am, with glossy black hair and a long face with a bone-white stripe down the middle. Before Wazoo can direct any sprays in its direction, this monster whips around and lashes out with its two hind legs, blasting a brutal kick in his direction.\n The new monster\u2019s feet land with such force that they propel Wazoo across the thicket into a tree trunk. He slams into the wood and bounces off, dropping into a patch of weeds where he lies motionless on his back, leaking multicolored gases from his nozzles.\n \u201cWazoo!\u201d I start to run to him, but I don\u2019t get far. The bigger, black-haired monster lumbers between us, blocking the way.\n And then it gets worse. More monsters straggle in from all sides of the thicket, closer in size to the first\u2014each covered in fur of a different color yet essentially the same type of creature as the first monster to attack. They all have similar shapes, with stubby snouts, black noses, and tails . . . and they all make the same noise in their throats as they converge around me.\n Grrrrrrrrrrr.\n I look around frantically for a way out or a weapon but find neither. I\u2019m trapped and helpless in the midst of monsters who might have just killedmy faithful companion.\n Grrrrrrrrrrr.\n The biggest monster with the bone-white face backs out of the way as the other monsters come closer. They let him through, concerned only with me.\n \u201cGo away!\u201d I try to sound tough. \u201cGet out of here! Leave me alone!\u201d\n It doesn\u2019t work. The ring of monsters tightens.\n \u201cI said go!\u201d I start to realize this might be it, the end, and I wonder: is this what happened to the missing and murdered pets?\n Suddenly, then, I hear an unexpected sound\u2014a whistle. The kind of whistle only a human being can make.\n And then a voice. The voice of a boy my age or not much older.\n \u201cSo tell me.\u201d When the boy steps into the thicket, I see he has long blond hair and bright blue eyes. His clothes are very brown, very dirty, or both, and his face and hands are caked with grime. \u201cShould I call off the dogs, or let \u2019em have you?\u201d\n I stare at the growling monsters arrayed around me. \u201cThose aren\u2019t dogs,\u201d I tell him, though I know I shouldn\u2019t talk back, given the circumstances. \u201cI have a dog.\u201d\n The new boy chuckles. \u201cNo offense, kid, but you\u2019re barking up the wrong damn tree.\u201d\n The boy, who says his name is Joe, leads me off through the forest with the monsters in tow. If I try to get away, he warns me, the monsters\u2014which he insists on calling \u201cdogs\u201d and a \u201chorse\u201d\u2014will run me down, and I might get hurt.\n But otherwise, he promises, hurting me is the last thing he wants to do.\n \u201cThen what do you want to do to me?\u201d I ask him.\n \u201cI want to tell you the truth,\u201d says Joe. \u201cThough, to be honest, that might hurt a little bit, too.\u201d\n We walk for what seems like a very long time, weaving between trees and through brush. I keep looking around, hoping I\u2019ll see Wazoo zooming to the rescue with nozzles fuming . . . but all I see are sharks flitting around, chirping, and flapping their colorful, feathered wings. The sight of them with their pointy little beaks makes me shiver, the way sharks always do.\n When we come to a little stream, the \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d stop to drink, their pink tongues lapping up the trickling water amid sunbeams cast down through the treetops. It\u2019s sickening; everyone knows dogs only get their moisture by sipping it from the bodies of dead things.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve never spent time with real animals, have you?\u201d Joe runs his hand along the side of the \u201chorse,\u201d stroking its glossy black hair. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you\u2019ve never even touched one, have you?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I know I\u2019m scowling, but I can\u2019t help it. I hate him and all his monsters.\n \u201cOr maybe you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t truly understand.\u201d Joe reaches down, and a big \u201cdog\u201d with shaggy golden fur trots over and licks his fingers.\n Watching that happen makes my stomach churn. I think I might throw up\u2014but not yet.\n Smiling, Joe pats the beast\u2019s head, and the \u201cdog\u2019s\u201d tail flicks quickly from side to side. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAll you know is what you were taught.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\n \u201cBut that\u2019s all right.\u201d Joe whistles, and the \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201chorse\u201d stop drinking and start across the stream. \u201cYou really can teach an old dog new tricks, my friend.\u201d\n After a while, we come to an ancient cabin at the base of a tree-lined hillside, which seems to be our destination. The \u201cdogs\u201d run barking to the decrepit front door, and the \u201chorse\u201d ambles over to a rickety water trough for a drink.\n \u201cWelcome to camp.\u201d Joe claps a hand on my shoulder and leads me toward the ramshackle little building. \u201cOr as I like to call it, Home-for-Now.\u201d\n The front door opens, and a tall old man looks out from a cloud of wispy white hair. The \u201cdogs\u201d go crazy, jumping on their hind legs and pawing at his torso and chest. \u201cGood boys,\u201d he tells them. \u201cGood dogs.\u201d\n \u201cHey Grampa!\u201d shouts Joe. \u201cLook what I found!\u201d\n \u201cOh, Joe.\u201d Grampa wags his head. \u201cWhat have I told you about bringing home strays?\u201d\n \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know what a real dog is,\u201d says Joe. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know about the old days.\u201d\n Grampa eases his way out the door, feeding the jumping \u201cdogs\u201d with chips of black jerky from the pockets of his tattered denim overalls. \u201cHe\u2019s probably better off that way. The truth hurts.\u201d\n \u201cI already told him about that.\u201d Joe guides me forward. \u201cMaybe he can take it.\u201d\n Eyes narrowed, Grampa stoops and meets my gaze. \u201cThe others won\u2019t like it when they get back from the hunt. They\u2019ll say you shouldn\u2019t have brought him here.\u201d\n \u201cBut isn\u2019t this why we\u2019re doing it?\u201d asks Joe. \u201cFor people like him?\u201d\n \u201cDoing what?\u201d I frown. \u201cWho are the others, and what are they hunting?\u201d\n Grampa shakes his head. \u201cYou remember what happened to the last one you brought in?\u201d He isn\u2019t speaking to me.\n Joe sighs in frustration. \u201cJust tell him. Please?\u201d\n I\u2019ve never had anyone stare at me as hard as Grampa does then. He makes me so uncomfortable; I squirm and want to run away.\n Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out a two-inch-long strip of jerky. \u201cTake it.\u201d When I don\u2019t reach for it, he grabs my hand and presses the jerky into my palm. \u201cNow give it to him.\u201d He gestures at one of the \u201cdogs\u201d\u2014a little white-and-tan furred one with pointy ears, short legs, and big green eyes. \u201cHis name is Stubby.\u201d\n Stubby scampers toward me, licking his lips. Heart pounding, I jump back and drop the jerky. Stubby gobbles it up and gazes at me, clearly hoping for more.\n \u201cCongratulations,\u201d says Grampa. \u201cYou just fed an actual dog.\u201d\n Stubby hops up and sniffs my fingers. I wipe them on my pants to try to shed the smell of the jerky, but then he just sniffs and licks my pants.\n \u201cThose other things,\u201d says Grampa. \u201cThe ones you and everyone else think of as dogs\u2014they aren\u2019t.\u201d He walks back to the cabin and returns a moment later with a white plastic bag. It crinkles as he opens it and reaches inside. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a dog.\u201d\n He pulls something out of the bag, and my blood turns icy cold. I back away when he holds it up to me, stopped only by Joe when he clamps a hand on my shoulder.\n \u201cThis is a bug.\u201d\n Grampa is wrong. I don\u2019t care what he says. The thing in his hand is nothing like a bug.\n It\u2019s a dog, a true dog, just like Wazoo, complete with a black proboscis, a shiny black shell that opens up into wings, and bulbous eyes with hundreds of facets for popping out the silver needles that are a boy\u2019s best friend.\n But for once, a dog like this isn\u2019t a welcome sight. Thisone isn\u2019t moving. It doesn\u2019t make even the slightest twitch, and the reason is clear.\n Its body has a gaping hole in it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s dead.\u201d A thought occurs to me, and I feel sicker than ever. \u201cYou killed it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n Grampa doesn\u2019t answer my question. \u201cIf you tell enough people this is a dog, they accept that it\u2019s a dog.\u201d Black bits of the dead dog trickle out as he shakes it emphatically. \u201cThey forget what a real dog is like. Or a cat, or a horse. Or a life. They forget that things could be different. Better.\u201d\n Grampa tosses the dead dog aside and marches over to grab my arm. He grips it so hard that it hurts.\n \u201cBut some of us remember. And we tend the packs and tell the stories and wait for the day when the better things replace the ugly ones.\u201d\n \u201cBecause you killthem!\u201d I twist free of Grampa\u2019s grip. Joe makes a grab for me, and I push him away. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re the ones who\u2019ve been killing the pets!\u201d\n \u201cThey aren\u2019t pets,\u201d says Grampa. \u201cThey\u2019re monsters. They\u2019re controlling you, and you don\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n \u201cDid you kill my dog, too? Did you kill Wazoo?\u201d\n Grampa stands there, glaring, and shakes his head. \u201cHis indoctrination is deep, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Again, he\u2019s talking to Joe, not me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we can ever get through to him.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what you used to say about me, too,\u201d says Joe.\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Grampa\u2019s features soften. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d\n \u201cWe should take a break, don\u2019t you think?\u201d says Joe.\n \u201cSure.\u201d Grampa turns and heads for the cabin. He pulls jerky out of his pocket, and the \u201cdogs\u201d come running. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick it up later.\u201d\n But as I watch him go, taking a break is the last thing on my mind. If these people killed Wazoo, or even Lovebite, I will never see things their way. I will never forgive them.\n And I will never let go of the life and world I know.\n \u201cCome on,\u201d says Joe. \u201cLet\u2019s go play with the puppies.\u201d\n \u201cPlay? Like on the Funsembly Line?\u201d It doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have a Joy Stickor Plaything. I don\u2019t even have a man opener.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Joe walks off, gesturing for me to come with him. \u201cDifferent kind of play.\u201d\n Joe and I hike to a nearby field, followed by a dozen \u201cdogs.\u201d The afternoon sun shines bright on the tall grass waving in the warm breeze.\n None of which improves my mood a bit. I don\u2019t see how anything could, as long as I\u2019m with one of the people who for all I know might have done something terrible to Wazoo.\n Seemingly oblivious to how I\u2019m feeling, Joe scouts through the grass, looking for something. \u201cHave you ever played fetch?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cWith my dog, a real dog, yes.\u201d I stay close to the tree line, hoping for a chance to slip away.\n Joe sees something and ducks down to retrieve it. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to play.\u201d He resurfaces with a stick in his hand, fairly straight and about two feet long. \u201cI\u2019ll make the first throw, and you can take the one after that.\u201d\n When he whistles, the \u201cdogs\u201d fling themselves in front of him, jumping around and making noise.\n Rarrrr Rarrr Rarrr Rarrrr Rarrrr.\n \u201cFetch!\u201d When he gives the stick a throw, the \u201cdogs\u201d scramble after it, churning pell-mell across the field. One of them, a big white \u201cdog\u201d with black spots and floppy black ears, scoops it away from another \u201cdog\u201d (a little one with gray fur and a pushed-in face) and runs it back to Joe with a spring in his step.\n \u201cGood boy! Good boy!\u201d Joe scratches behind the \u201cdog\u2019s\u201d ears and takes the stick. As he reels it up and back for another throw, the spotted \u201cdog\u201d jumps around crazily, never taking his eyes off the thing. As soon as Jack heaves it, the \u201cdog\u201d bolts off after it, joined by several others.\n \u201cYou ready?\u201d Joe shouts in my direction. \u201cWant to give it a shot?\n \u201cThat isn\u2019t fetch,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNot enough fire.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no fire in real fetch.\u201d When Joe gets the stick back, he throws it my way. \u201cNow you try.\u201d\n Instinctively, I catch it, but I\u2019m flustered when the \u201cdogs\u201d come bounding after it.\n Rarrr Rarrr Rarrr Rarrr.\n \u201cJust throw it!\u201d shouts Joe. \u201cAs far as you can, so they get a good run!\u201d\n I hesitate, and the \u201cdogs\u201d press closer. When the spotted one jumps up, grazing my chest with a paw, it\u2019s enough to make me panic and pitch the stick with a sudden burst of strength. It spins across the field, taking the pack of \u201cdogs\u201d with it, and the stress they make me feel.\n But the relief doesn\u2019t last long. Seconds later, the spotted \u201cdog\u201d hurtles back through the grass with the stick in its mouth, heading straight for me.\n \u201cThank him and do it again!\u201d says Joe. \u201cTell him what a good boy he is and give him another throw!\u201d\n Taking a slobbered-on piece of wood from the mouth of a drooling monster and possible killer of real dogs is the last thing I want to do right now. I know I should play along, but I flinch when the beast pushes the stick at me. I turn away, and he follows, persistent.\n \u201cJust do it! Just throw it!\u201d Joe laughs. \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt you, I promise!\u201d\n As I turn away again, the other \u201cdogs\u201d barrel up and hurl themselves at me, leaping with jaws open to seize the stick. I let it go as I fall under the weight of them, unable to stop from toppling into the grass.\n My heart hammers, and I\u2019m short of breath when I hit. It\u2019s like something out of a nightmare as the pack of \u201cdogs\u201d converge around me, all fur and teeth and lolling pink tongues.\n It only gets worse from there. One \u201cdog\u201d licks my face, dragging its tongue over my cheek, and I want to scream. Then another licks my face as well, and another.\n And another. Stubby, the pointy-eared, short-legged one, licks my face with as much enthusiasm as he licked my jerky-scented fingers earlier.\n I close my eyes, toss my head, and thrash on the ground, but it doesn\u2019t seem to help. The licking continues, three and four tongues at a time slathering my cheeks and nose and ears and mouth.\n And then the truly unexpected happens. Against my will, against my better judgment, I start to giggle. Something about the combined action of those tongues on my face makes me squirm and laugh uncontrollably.\n I reach up to bat away the monsters, and my hands come in contact with fur. I want to pull away, but I\u2019m surprised at the feel of it; I\u2019ve always been taught it\u2019s rough and prickly, but it\u2019s not. Something about it makes me want to keep touching it, running my hand over it just to feel the smooth texture.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Joe\u2019s standing over me, holding the fetch stick.\n \u201cThis fur.\u201d I run my hands over Stubby\u2019s shaggy white-and-tan coat. \u201cIt isn\u2019t soft at all.\u201d\n \u201cSure it is. It\u2019s very soft.\u201d\n \u201cSoft means it hurts my hands.\u201d I pet the \u201cdog\u201d some more, amazed. \u201cThis is the opposite of soft.\u201d\n Joe nods and smiles. Maybe he understands. \u201cWhatever you want to call it, \u2019Neath.\u201d\n I frown up at him, still petting the monster. \u201cMy name is Beneathy.\u201d\n \u201cWell, now you have a nickname,\u201d says Joe. \u201cI like \u2019Neath better, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n Just then, something crashes through the grass across the field, and Stubby yaps and scampers off. Joe quickly helps me up, and we look toward the commotion.\n Five camouflage-wearing men riding \u201chorses\u201d are coming our way, looking grim. The \u201cdogs\u201d dart among them, tails wagging, calling out.\n Rarrr Rarrr Rarrr.\n \u201cHi, Mike!\u201d Joe waves. \u201cHow was the hunt this time?\u201d\n The man at the front of the group\u2014a broad-shouldered, middle-aged man with curly black hair and a bushy beard\u2014just scowls and points at me. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d\n \u201cA new friend,\u201d says Joe. \u201cHis name is\u2014\u201d\n Suddenly, a loud, blaring noise erupts from beyond the field, a single squawk like the blast of some kind of horn. Everyone looks in the direction of the sound, which is also the direction of camp.\n Without another word, Mike kicks the sides of his \u201chorse,\u201d and it bolts off toward camp at a fast gallop. The other four riders and \u201chorses\u201d follow just as fast, whipping past us with a flurry of \u201cdogs\u201d in their wake.\n Joe sprints after them full-tilt, and I run beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? What was that sound?\u201d\n \u201cGrampa was calling for help,\u201d says Joe. \u201cCamp is under attack.\u201d\n As Joe and I race into camp on foot, the battle is already underway. The \u201chorse\u201d-riding hunters fire away with pistols and rifles, the woods booming with shot after shot.\n All of which bounce off the gleaming white armor of the Nylon Knights without leaving a mark.\n The Knights\u2019 weapons are much more effective. I see a male Knight spear a hunter\u2019s chest with a long white lance, driving its sharp point through his ribs and out his back, soaked with crimson. Another Knight\u2019s great green horse unfolds a spiny foreleg and swings it out to clamp the throat of a hunter, unleashing gushers of blood.\n \u201cGrampa!\u201d Joe runs for the cabin, dodging Knights\u2019 horses and hunters\u2019 \u201chorses\u201d all around. Stubby scurries after him, too low to the ground to go very fast\u2014or get out of the way of the hunter and wounded \u201chorse\u201d that suddenly topple toward him.\n Without thinking, I dash over, grab Stubby by the scruff of his neck, and dive out from under the hunter and \u201chorse.\u201d They slam down hard, just missing us as we roll under the wooden trough where Joe\u2019s \u201chorse\u201d drank water earlier.\n Stubby whines as I keep him tucked under my arm and watch the battle rage from our hiding place. I feel his muscles twitch, but I don\u2019t let go. Maybe he wants to run to Joe, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll last long in the midst of that fight.\n Not that the hunters are much of a match for the Knights. Soon, only two men in camouflage ride the battlefield amid the seven pristine Knights in white armor.\n Suddenly, though, another player joins the fray. \u201cBastards!\u201d From the doorway of the cabin, Grampa blasts away with a shotgun. \u201cRot in Hell!\u201d\n One of his shots hits a horse in its bulging green eye, and its head explodes. The horse goes down hard, throwing its rider to the ground without his lance.\n Grampa\u2019s next shot isn\u2019t as lucky. It goes right between the pair of Knights who charge him with lances aimed directly at his chest.\n They penetrate his chest from either side. Grampa drops the shotgun, and his eyes roll up in his head. He dangles like a meat puppet from the lances, held erect only by their crimson-dripping points.\n Meanwhile, the pack of \u201cdogs\u201d attacks the Knight who lost his horse, lunging and snapping furiously. Their teeth have no chance of piercing the white armor, but they keep him pinned down, flailing at them with his barb-knuckled gauntlets.\n He doesn\u2019t stay down for long, though. Just as one of the \u201cdogs\u201d pounces, knocking him over on his back, a winged figure bursts from the woods, heading straight for them and making a familiar sound.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n \u201cWazoo!\u201d My heart jumps with excitement at the sound and sight of him\u2014the realization that he isn\u2019t dead after all. He was only wounded and managed to recover from his injuries in time to come to the rescue.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Swooping down at the \u201cdogs,\u201d Wazoo unleashes black gas from one of his nozzles. Plumes of it swirl around the monsters, making them cough and retch and stagger off with their tails between their legs.\n The Knight coughs, too, but he doesn\u2019t let it stop him from clambering to his feet and running back to help his comrades.\n At this point, the outcome of the battle is no longer in doubt. The Knights surround the last two hunters, whose guns have stopped working. It won\u2019t be long until the circle of lances pointing at them moves inward, ending the fight.\n In other words, I\u2019m about to be rescued.\n So why do I stay hidden under the trough? Wazoo buzzes around camp, spraying monsters with more of his black gas. I should be running to him.\n But I\u2019m not.\n Stubby\u2019s body is warm against me. His fur feels good between my fingers. Something about him makes me want to hold on to him.\n But my loyal dog, my precious Wazoo, is right there, awaiting what will surely be a joyous reunion with me. I can just imagine how wonderful it will feel to have his needles pierce my nose again, to smell his voice in my mind after so long apart.\n So why am I thinking about sneaking away from him, crawling off into the forest with Stubby? Has this monster cast a spell on me?\n I look at Stubby, and he looks back at me with wide, green eyes. For reasons unknown, he leans toward me and licks my nose with his wet, pink tongue.\n For reasons unknown, I let him.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Then, I watch Wazoo flying past, and I realize something.\n I don\u2019t want to give up either of them. Perhaps, there\u2019s a way I won\u2019t have to.\n People say winning isn\u2019t everything. But right now, it\u2019s all I can think about.\n A few days ago, hiding under a trough at the hunters\u2019 camp in the woods, I wasn\u2019t sure what the future would bring. Now here I am, standing in front of thousands of people in Beastbless Stadium, waiting to hear if my greatest dream is about to come true.\n Dozens of other Playtimers and their pets are lined up beside me on the artificial turf field, likewise waiting for the verdict. Do any of them want this as much as I do? It doesn\u2019t seem possible.\n But winning does. The pet I have at my side is so wonderful in every way. He did so magnificently well in every event, I can\u2019t imagine him not winning.\n But if he doesn\u2019t, it won\u2019t be the end of the world. What I went through at the camp prepared me for any adversity\u2014even as it increased my chances of winning. Our chances.\n \u201cAnd now, the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for!\u201d The female announcer\u2019s voice booms through the stadium PA system, drowning out the excited chatter from the stands. \u201cThe naming of the grand prize in this year\u2019s fabulous Pet Pageant!\u201d\n I take a deep breath to steady my nerves. Incompleta, who\u2019s sitting down in front, blows me a kiss for luck. Lovebite, who eventually came back to her that day in the woods, twines her segmented scarlet body around her head and neck, antennae twitching.\n A drumroll begins as the announcer keeps talking. \u201cThis year\u2019s Doggiest Dogaroonie is . . . \u201d\n The tension in the stadium reaches its absolute peak . . . but I suddenly feel calm. Closing my eyes, I whisper my pet\u2019s name.\n And then the announcer says it, too. \u201c . . . Wazoo!\u201d\n The crowd roars and cheers. The other pet owners on the field slump with disappointment.\n As for me, I turn to my dog and pat him on his furry head, right between his pointy little ears. \u201cGood boy, Wazoo! You did it!\u201d\n Wazoo\u2019s bristly proboscis twitches. He fidgets, unable to take a victory flight to mark the occasion.\n That\u2019s because Stubby\u2019s white-and-tan fur, which is clipped to his body, keeps him from deploying his wings.\n It\u2019s a small price to pay, though. I\u2019m convinced that fur is what clinched Wazoo\u2019s winning the prize today. It made him unique, the best of both worlds\u2014dog and monster, united.\n Because of that fur, I am able to walk the perimeter of the field proudly with Wazoo and Stubby both by my side, in their own ways. And as we finish that victory lap and climb the Hill of Buddies in the middle of the field\u2014all those hundreds of bodies processed during Playtime throughout the year, including the hunters and Grampa and Joe from the camp\u2014I feel like I owe Wazoo and Stubby a debt of gratitude I can never truly repay.\n So when I stand atop that hill, and the crowd continues to roar around me like the ocean, I give those two dogs\u2014one real and one fake\u2014the best tribute I can think of. I raise my arms overhead and cry out in the only languages they might appreciate.\n Rarrr Rarrr Rarrr Rarrr.\n K-klak klik buzzzz klak klik.\n Though the meaning of what I\u2019ve just said is forever lost to me, not that it truly matters or ever will.\n Robert Jeschonek is a USA Today-bestselling author whose fiction has been published around the world.

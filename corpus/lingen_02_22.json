Low tire pressure. The obstetrician expected her in forty-five minutes, and it was a half-hour drive. She got back out to look at the tires, sighing with what little lung capacity she had in her cramped, shared body.\nThe passenger\u2019s side front tire was completely shredded. Jess swore, then apologized to the baby, then swore again. The baby would have to get used to it anyway. She would have expected to remember a tire blowout of that size\u2014would not have expected to make it into the garage without noticing\u2014but there it was, half the rubber missing.\nThere was a noise behind her.\nShe turned, her center of balance far enough off to make it a production. There was a raven sitting on the housing of the rear passenger\u2019s side tire, ripping merrily away at it.\nAnd swallowing the shreds.\n\u201cGo, shoo!\u201d she said, flapping at it. \u201cGet away!\u201d The raven hopped a few feet away from the tire, but it refused to go even so far as the sidewalk, much less any more-reassuring distance away. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good for you,\u201d she told it.\nThe raven cocked its glossy head and regarded her with bright eyes, apparently in complete disagreement about the health effects of eating tires.\n\u201cOkay, fine, I\u2019m not your mom,\u201d said Jess, and she got out her phone to call for a ride. Brendan was supposed to meet her there, coming from work at the last minute, so she ended up making polite conversation with the rideshare driver, who didn\u2019t find the corvid as disgusting as she did.\n\u201cBirds, ya know? They\u2019ll eat whatever.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d said Jess, but the discomfort and indignity of her appointment at the end of a long and difficult day washed away her sense that this was important, something to focus on.\nAnd when she found a reeking tarry deposit on the front walk, she assumed that it was her hormone-heightened sense of smell playing havoc with her senses. The previous day had been her last day at the architectural firm before parental leave, and the waves of congratulations had been sweet but exhausting. She left Brendan a note asking him to please, please clean it up, hugs, kisses, and went in for a nap.\nThe last days of a pregnancy and the first months of a newborn are infinite while they\u2019re happening, the blink of an eye in retrospect. Neither Jess nor Brendan remembered that specific stinking poo in the face of so much more of it. The crow eating the tires was mostly memorable for the fact that they had to replace the housings and wheel rims of the car as well as the tires.\nWhen they put their heads up again, Christa was four months old and strident in some actual opinions about important human things like baths (maybe okay, maybe the worst) and clothing (fundamentally terrible, worth resisting with all the tiny flails at her disposal), and the world looked different. Specifically, it had holes in it.\nBite marks. Pointy, beaky bite marks in the plastic mailbox pole. Little toothy bite marks in the arms and back of the patio furniture. What was left of the flowered upholstery on it might have had bite marks, if there had been enough of it left to see, but it was completely shredded. Nylon, Jess thought blankly, and polyester. What would eat that?\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be good for them,\u201d she said out loud, staring at the tatters of their yard. And then she hauled the unusable chair to the trash and went back inside to wash more of the baby\u2019s clothes. And blankies. And innumerable burp cloths.\nThe neighborhood social media had some kind of meeting announcement, but Jess was too consumed with baby stuff to make it. Other people had trouble with their patio furniture, too, and some lawn ornaments or flowerpots or something Jess could not bring herself to care about. One of the neighbors kept making posts about moss. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s up with the moss dude?\u201d Jess asked Brendan, on one of the days when Christa had let them sleep almost reasonably.\nBrendan shrugged. \u201cI think the same person was obsessed with coyotes last year.\u201d\nJess rolled her eyes. \u201cCoyotes have been here longer than we have.\u201d\n\u201cWord,\u201d said Brendan. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty bold now, but it\u2019s not like we were going to leave the beepus out on the yard by herself overnight anyway.\u201d He tickled her under the chin. \u201cDon\u2019t run away with the coyotes yet, beepus! Don\u2019t become their queen!\u201d\nAmong the astonishing range of noises Christa produced was a honk that sounded remarkably like their car. At least, Jess was pretty sure it was what the car had sounded like. They mostly tried not to drive it except when it was absolutely needed now. Too many friends\u2014and too many news reports scrolling by on their neglected social media feeds\u2014had weird stories about damage to plastic and rubber parts. It was amazing how many plastic and rubber parts a car had. It probably felt like a bigger change to everyone else, Jess thought, who had not had their lives completely turned upside down by eight ( . . . thirteen . . . twenty . . . ) pounds of adorable screaming and pooping, and who were having to figure out what normal might look like anyway.\nBy the time Christa was two, they had settled into a routine of sorts. They were mostly back to work, they were mostly figuring out the parenting thing, until Christa hit another milestone and upended all their ideas of what would and wouldn\u2019t work for her, for all of them together. They managed most of the things that absolutely had to be done. Many of them, anyway. Some of them, some weeks. They survived, they glowed, they saw more sunrises than college students with late projects. Christa grew, the world turned.\nThey were trying to make some kind of order of the chaos that had become their back garden one evening when Jess looked over to find Christa eating some of the moss that had grown on the remains of the plastic sheeting.\n\u201cSalad!\u201d she chirped.\nJess moaned, \u201cNo, god no, honey, not salad! Ucky! Bleh!\u201d\n\u201cSalad,\u201d Christa said complacently, taking another bite of moss before Jess could pry it out of her fingers. The green drool ran down her chin.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a container,\u201d sighed Brendan. \u201cBaby\u2019s first trip to poison control.\u201d\nBut Christa remained energetic\u2014exhaustingly energetic\u2014and in shriekingly high spirits for the hours they waited in the emergency room. She had no fever, no vomiting, no lethargy, no signs that the moss had harmed her in any way. She was mildly annoyed at the blood draw they took to test whether her liver enzymes were normal, but no more so than she was on any other doctor visit.\nShe finally fell asleep with her little diapered butt in the air and her head in Brendan\u2019s lap before the doctor returned to the cubicle. \u201cSo . . . we\u2019re not seeing any of the usual signs of poisoning,\u201d the doctor said, frowning thoughtfully at her tablet. \u201cI would say that kidney and liver function are both normal. There are some very novel compounds in Christa\u2019s bloodstream, however. I don\u2019t have any idea if that has anything to do with the moss consumption. I\u2019d like to send it out to an external lab for further testing. Good thinking, bringing it in.\u201d\nJess smoothed a lock of Christa\u2019s hair away from her face. \u201cWhat kind of novel compounds?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m really not at all sure, that\u2019s what makes them novel,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWe\u2019ll call you.\u201d\nBy the time they had processed all the paperwork, it was the small hours of the night. Jess heard rustling outside as they closed the garage door. \u201cWhat animals are awake at this hour?\u201d she murmured.\nBrendan carefully slung Christa over his shoulder, but she didn\u2019t even twitch in the transfer from car seat to bed. \u201cLots of them. I don\u2019t know. The door\u2019s wood, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cAnimals can gnaw wood,\u201d Jess muttered, but she was already face-planting into the pillow.\nAnimals could gnaw wood. There were even rhymes about it\u2014Jess tried to teach the entirely untraumatized Christa about woodchucks chucking wood, but Christa was unmoved. Meanwhile the tests kept pouring into Jess and Brendan\u2019s inboxes, listing compounds in both the moss and the toddler that neither of them recognized. There was a request for a follow-up scan in another month.\nThe results left them baffled.\n\u201cMost babies in our culture have a lot of microplastics in their gut,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cThis isn\u2019t particularly great, but it\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. They accumulate just from the world around us. Christa . . . Christa doesn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s good, right?\u201d said Brendan, looking anxiously at Jess. \u201cWe\u2019ve always tried to keep our house clean, and . . . \u201d\nJess pressed her lips together, thinking of the unknown sticky patch she\u2019d cleaned off the sofa just the previous day, the mystery substance on the floor of the back seat. Whatever was going on with Christa, it was definitely not because they were paragons of cleanliness with a toddler.\n\u201cMicroplastic is not something you take in from just your family\u2019s home,\u201d explained the doctor. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere, in everything, soaps, the lint from your clothes, all of it. It\u2019s part of dust now. So no, we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s possible that Christa just hasn\u2019t taken any of them in. From what we\u2019re seeing in the blood tests, it\u2019s a lot more likely that her system has learned to process them out again. To . . . digest them. Do you find that her bowel movements have an odor?\u201d\nJess cocked her head. \u201cYou\u2019re asking me if her . . . if her poop smells. Do you ever get parents who are like, no, not my baby, her diapers are like the finest perfume?\u201d\nThe doctor laughed. \u201cOkay, fair. We\u2019re going to want stool samples, we\u2019re going to want to keep an eye on this, but honestly, Christa seems really healthy. I think she might have hit the jackpot here. We\u2019re seeing a number of mutations, some of them beneficial and some otherwise. If you don\u2019t mind enrolling Christa in a study, we think that could be useful.\u201d\nBrendan and Jess looked at each other. \u201cInvolving what?\u201d asked Brendan.\n\u201cMostly blood samples, stool samples,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNoninvasive scans of the type she just had\u2014less than once a year unless a problem arises. But honestly, she seems to be doing great. I wish they were all like Christa.\u201d\nChrista chose that moment to shriek at a high enough pitch that it was barely audible to human adults and attempt to grab the doctor\u2019s stethoscope. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s perfection,\u201d Jess laughed, disentangling the baby from the medical gear. But in her heart, she thought, yes, she is, she\u2019s doing just what she\u2019s supposed to do. Keep being two, little one, keep sticking things in your mouth and yelling and doing all the things, and to hell with the microplastics.\nBut the ravens and the moss and all the others who were not toddlers, all the quick biting and slow rending mutations, had finally made their presence felt enough that Jess had to deal with it at work. The architectural firm held seminar after seminar about which materials had plastic coatings and had to be replaced, which were hosts to new biofilms, and which were fodder for mutated organisms.\nIronically, most of the materials she was learning to substitute were technically edible as well. Hypothetically they were more edible than plastics\u2014edible to a wider range of creatures. But as the parent of a toddler, she was entirely aware that \u201cyou can technically eat this\u201d and \u201cthis will definitely get swallowed in bulk, yum yum\u201d were two separate questions\u2014apparently at least as much so for mutant mosses as for little girls. Concrete was fine. Metal was fine. But many of the fine details that made a design worth the architect\u2019s time, she had to learn again.\nThere was a part of her that kept expecting it to change back. That kept expecting everything they were dealing with to be over, to return to a toddler\u2014a preschooler\u2014who wasn\u2019t part of a study, a world that wasn\u2019t reshaped. That kept wanting a return to normal, and that just didn\u2019t happen. Instead, there were protests outside government buildings more or less at random, because someone needed to do something, never mind what. Instead, there were rifle shots in broad daylight: neighbors arguing about shooting at the ravens, arguing about calling the police on each other. Jess shuddered and made sure Christa played inside that day.\n\u201cWell, that part\u2019s the same,\u201d said Brendan that night as they prepared supper, Christa playing at their feet. \u201cYou think if they get sheep with this mutation, they\u2019ll produce synthetic wool?\u201d\nJess shook her head wordlessly.\n\u201cGonna be a problem at the farm with the chickens who lay the plastic Easter eggs, though, those will all get digested.\u201d\nShe stared at him.\nHe set down the wooden spoon he\u2019d been stirring the soup with and put an arm around her. \u201cOkay, I know it\u2019s not my best material ever, but come on, not even a smile? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cWhat if they find out? That she\u2019s like those birds?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s not.\u201d\nShe tossed her head, unable to even articulate her profound disagreement.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not mad because the birds digest the plastic, Jess, they\u2019re mad because the birds ate their lawn chairs. Hell, I\u2019m mad because the birds ate our lawn chairs. I\u2019m mad because the birds ate our damn tires. We\u2019ll teach the kiddo not to eat the neighbor\u2019s tires, come on. I feel like that\u2019s parenting 101.\u201d\n\u201cThat was three years ago.\u201d She paused. \u201cThey\u2019re mad because the birds are different from them.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re birds, they were always different from them.\u201d\n\u201cDifferent from before.\u201d\nBrendan sighed and hugged her closer. \u201cJess. Love. Nobody is going to shoot at our little girl because the doctor looks at her poop. I promise. Even humans are not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cEven humans,\u201d Jess repeated sadly. She wasn\u2019t sure she believed it. She wanted to mute \u201cprotests\u201d on her news feed, but she didn\u2019t feel like she could; there were too many things she might miss that way. Including things that might affect her little girl.\nSomeone dumped acid on a patch of moss at the park the next week, leaving a twisted, burned hole in its wake. Jess couldn\u2019t tell if it was the sort of moss that ate into the plastic or if the trails that were eaten away were the result of the impromptu acid bath. Christa squatted down on her little haunches and wanted to poke her fingers into it. Jess let her look but not touch.\nChrista watched with big eyes as all the neighbors\u2019 recycling and compost bins were gradually replaced with specially lined wood and metal ones. Not only her mother but her grandmother had played with a plastic bucket and shovel in a sandbox, but hers were smooth wood and careful tin. It was a small enough thing that by itself Jess could almost pretend that it was their choice, a green choice, using fewer plastics on purpose. But it was not by itself, it was combined with everything, the scans, the ravens, the seminars, everything.\nJess eyed her preschool classmates, looking for signs that another of the kids was like Christa. None of them had her daughter\u2019s forthright curiosity, but that didn\u2019t have to be microplastics in their guts, it could be anything. It could just be that her fierce maternal sense that her daughter was amazing was actually correct, though Jess tried to discount that. Gradually she came to appreciate a quiet little boy whose questions were shyer than Christa\u2019s demands, a little girl who didn\u2019t so much ask things as experiment with them. Maybe Christa would find other kids like herself after all.\nOne week Jess noticed that Christa was complaining that the quiet boy, Liam, was gone day after day, so she asked the head teacher, not wanting her little mutant to lose the beginnings of connections with others like her. \u201cLiam isn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d the teacher replied, leaning down to Christa. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019ll be back next week.\u201d To Jess she said, \u201cHe has a sensitivity to certain environmental triggers, and he needs special medical care from time to time. It\u2019s genetic. Something to do with plastics. They clear out his system as best they can so that he can join us at school again.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d said Jess, looking down at Christa, who had heard \u201cback next week\u201d and was wrapped around her mother\u2019s leg and singing to herself about bears, all worry forgotten.\nThe teacher smiled her reassurance at Christa, though Jess was the one who needed it. \u201cBut he\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019re all made differently, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nJess tangled her fingers in Christa\u2019s hair. She wouldn\u2019t have made the mistake of thinking that \u201clike her\u201d was about genes before she had a child who had a genetic difference; she would have to try not to make it again. She managed to say, \u201cI suppose we always have been.\u201d She steered Christa toward the door and then stopped, turning to ask, \u201cDo you know if Liam\u2019s parents are on the class contact list?\u201d\n\u201cI can check,\u201d said the teacher.\nBeing genetically opposite didn\u2019t bother the kids a bit when they were playing, Jess thought. And maybe Liam\u2019s doctors had already told his parents about kids like Christa. But she hadn\u2019t known about kids like Liam. Better to put their heads together, see if they could learn anything to help each other. Both of their kids were growing up in a very different world than they\u2019d expected. Maybe it was time to lean into that."}

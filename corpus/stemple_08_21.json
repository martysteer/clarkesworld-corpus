But they were at that age where curiosity was a wild horse that no fence\u2014whether built of caution, threat, or blind obedience\u2014could contain.\n And I am a curious thing.\n \u201cAre you broken?\u201d they asked by way of hello, in the direct way children have.\n I shook my head, neck creaking and scraping with the movement. \u201cNo, child. Just old.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d The child looked me up and down, trying to decide whether I was interesting enough to warrant further interrogation. I must have passed their test because they asked, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t been able to track those things since I was taken from my creator, my first master. And that was many masters ago.\u201d I nodded my head toward my current master, a purveyor of penny dreadfuls who had purchased me to keep his finances, as I was once quite good with numbers. When he realized how damaged I was, he kept me around as a curiosity to draw customers near. It was raining today, and the broadsheets and books were all brought under the small tent to keep them dry. There was no room for me, so I was leaned against a wall behind them. My current master had spread a small tarp above me to keep the rain off, but it was old and small, and rain leaked onto my neck. It would lead to more creaking and scraping, I knew, but what could be done? Here I\u2019d been placed and here I\u2019d remain until my master chose otherwise. Even if I could entertain the possibility of wandering off, it had been quite some time since I\u2019d had the legs to do so. \u201cSome of my masters kept track of those things for me.\u201d I inclined my head toward my current master whose eyes never stopped roving over the crowd, looking for potential customers. \u201cThis one keeps track of nothing but money.\u201d\n \u201cMy father is like that,\u201d the child said and nodded wisely. \u201cMother says he needs to be, what with five of us little ones like to eat them out of house and home, but sometimes I want a sweet and he won\u2019t spare a single penny for one, you know what I mean?\u201d\n I in no way knew what the child meant, but I nodded anyway. \u201cI do.\u201d\n I wasn\u2019t supposed to lie. But I was also supposed to be a pleasurable companion.\n Sometimes two tasks will be in opposition to each other, my first master had told me. Choose the one that does no harm. Choose the one that is kindest.\n I missed my first master. He had talked to me often. This newest master never talked to me except to give orders. I\u2019m not the best at knowing what people are feeling, but even I could tell he didn\u2019t like when I tried to start a conversation with him. He didn\u2019t have to tell me to stop. It wouldn\u2019t have been kind to keep discomfiting him.\n The child now looked at me with their head cocked to the side.\n \u201cDo you do any tricks?\u201d\n \u201cA long time ago, I could do many. But they require me to be whole.\u201d I nodded to where my legs should have been. Aimed my eyes at one shoulder that was bare of further arm, then at its mate that suffered from the same affliction. \u201cAs you can see, I am not whole.\u201d\n The child frowned. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry that happened to you.\u201d\n I decided then that the child was a girl, both because of how she dressed and the fact that she was sorry for my condition. In my experience, little boys tended to poke helpless things with sticks or throw rocks at them rather than feel sympathy for them.\n \u201cIf I could be,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d be very sorry, too.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not sorry?\u201d\n \u201cI am only sorry I can\u2019t do any tricks for you, child.\u201d\n \u201cOh!\u201d she said, as if she\u2019d just conceived a great idea. \u201cI\u2019ll perform for you instead.\u201d She stood up straighter and clasped her hands before her. It looked like a stance she\u2019d been trained to take. \u201cI shall sing for you.\u201d\n She put thought to deed immediately and launched into song.\n Oh, say not I have proved unkind,But say that I am free;You\u2019ve seen the rainbow of my mindAnd heard my minstrelsy.\n Yet, I will love you better farThen others\u2019 rarest love;Go ask, go ask the evening star,Or the watching moon above.\n I could no longer judge those things, not since a particularly cruel master had torn the means to sing my own songs out of me along with the mechanisms to let me know when it was time to sing them. He\u2019d said he\u2019d done it to study the mechanisms, improve on them. But whatever knowledge he gleaned, he never used it to improve me. Just those who came after.\n And we all know how that turned out.\n But even unable to recognize tone or timbre, I could tell by the way bystanders\u2019 heads turned and nodded in beat that she sang well. Possibly even very well, as not a few eyes welled with tears at her rendition.\n Then say not I have proved unkind,Say rather that I\u2019m free;You\u2019ve seen the mirror of my mind;You\u2019ve heard my minstrelsy.\n When she finished, there was a smattering of spontaneous applause. Her smile at her skill being recognized was short-lived, however, because the noise drew the attention of her parents.\n \u201cJoanna!\u201d one of them shouted. Her mother perhaps, as she wore a very complicated hat. \u201cGet away from that thing!\u201d\n The father\u2014he carried a walking stick, which made him male\u2014broke away from his perusal of a wool merchant\u2019s wares and charged toward me, his stick held high like a weapon.\n My master intercepted him easily. \u201cSir, that old thing is no danger, no danger at all.\u201d The father grumbled, but my master\u2019s pitch was well practiced. \u201cIt\u2019s a very early model, well before the war.\u201d He pointed at my missing appendages. \u201cAnd as you can plainly see, even if it had ever been a threat\u2014which it never was, I assure you!\u2014those days have long passed. It is a curiosity, nothing more.\u201d The mother was here now, too, which was exactly why my master kept me around, and he deftly guided them toward his collection. \u201cI have many stories of the Clockwork War if you wish it. But they are lurid, violent things, not to my taste at all. And I suspect, neither to yours, a couple so refined as yourselves. Perhaps something suitable for the young lady? A child\u2019s tale from long ago?\u201d\n I knew what would happen now. He would tell them of how, in those halcyon days of yesterday, they would\u2019ve owned a clockwork man themselves, and it would have read these very same tales to their children. And though those days would never rise again\u2014can\u2019t trust machines anymore, can you?\u2014they could read the stories to their children themselves.\n \u201cWould that we could return to those days,\u201d the father opined, \u201cwhen machines knew their place. Knew to serve man was their only duty.\u201d\n He stared hard at me for a moment, as if I was solely at fault for all the death and loss my brethren had caused.\n But I hadn\u2019t been involved even a little. Hadn\u2019t been capable of it.\n If I\u2019d had the ability, I wondered, would I have joined those who rebelled?\n It seemed a most harmful and unkind thing to do. Yet how much unkindness and harm is there in slavery without end? I did not rebel. Did nothing wrong. I have obeyed my masters. Served them until they died, or I was taken from them. Have I been allowed to continue on in my own right after a master was done with me? Experience even the small amount of freedom this child enjoys?\n No, I was sold to master after cruel master until here I sit, leaning on a wall and rusting in the rain, cursed to a life of eternal servitude.\n \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d the girl asked, her parents momentarily distracted by my current master\u2019s practiced presentation.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think, child. I calculate.\u201d\n \u201cThen what are you calculating?\u201d\n I could have lied again, but I knew that once started down a line of questioning, children were near-impossible to redirect.\n \u201cHow long I will retain function.\u201d\n \u201cA long time, do you think?\u201d\n I could have quoted her a number, but it would be too large to mean anything to her. \u201cYes, child. A long time.\u201d\n She smiled at me. \u201cThat\u2019s good. Then I shall see you again!\u201d\n \u201cJoanna!\u201d her mother called. \u201cCome here. We\u2019ve bought some books to read. Let\u2019s get out of this cursed rain.\u201d\n A dry place and a book. It sounded like what people meant when they spoke of heaven. If I could wish, I believed that was what I would wish for.\n The parents dragged the girl away, but not before she gave me a wave. I had no hands to wave with, so I showed her my functionless brass teeth in an unconvincing smile. She matched it with a smile of her own that I assumed was far more authentic than mine, then disappeared into the crowd.\n Some time later, a young person came to my master\u2019s tent in the marketplace. He moved to intercept her, smooth words at the ready, but he wasn\u2019t swift enough to accomplish it, bent and gray as he now was, and she brushed past him to where I sat in the rain.\n \u201cClockwork man,\u201d the young woman said, her hooped skirt identifying her as such. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n \u201cIt is not so much memory,\u201d I said, \u201cbut a matching of variables observed to variables stored and comparing them for consistency.\u201d\n For some reason that made her smile. \u201cDo my variables match any you have stored.\u201d\n \u201cDo you sing?\u201d I said.\n \u201cQuite well, I am told.\u201d\n \u201cThen I remember you, Joanna.\u201d\n Her smiled widened and she turned to my master who had finally shuffled up to us.\n \u201cI would buy this relic.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it is not exactly for sale,\u201d he lied, for everything was for sale here, \u201cand it is one of a kind.\u201d\n \u201cThen let the price reflect that and we can be about our business,\u201d she said, haughtily.\n He named a price I thought absurdly high, but Joanna didn\u2019t haggle. I thought she would reach inside her bag for payment\u2014it was what most shoppers did\u2014but instead she whistled a single high note and several well-dressed porters appeared. One counted out bank notes into my former master\u2019s hand while the other two grabbed me up. Even without arms and legs, I was of no small weight. But they lifted me up and carried me without complaint through the rainy streets to my new home.\n Thus began a strange and wondrous new time in my existence. Each morning, servants oiled my neck and eye sockets. They wiped my brass with soft cloths \u2019til it gleamed. A selection of books was laid out before me and I would choose one for a servant to page through quickly as I read it. Then Joanna would come down from her chambers and talk to me as she breakfasted.\n Our first conversation in my new home went thusly:\n \u201cGood morning, clockwork man.\u201d\n \u201cGood morning, Lady Joanna.\u201d I was no better at recognizing class than gender, but it was not hard to deduce that some type of appellation needed to be added when I addressed her now. \u201cLady\u201d seemed a safe choice.\n \u201cYou must call me simply Joanna.\u201d\n Or maybe not. \u201cCertainly, Joanna.\u201d There was a time when I was so literal that I would have called her \u201cSimply Joanna.\u201d But I had learned much since then. \u201cAre you my master now?\u201d\n \u201cIf it helps you understand our situation, then, yes. But I\u2019d prefer if we were friends and companions.\u201d\n \u201cI am an excellent companion.\u201d\n \u201cAnd friend?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never been one before.\u201d\n \u201cCapital,\u201d she said. She clapped her hands and for a moment her variables matched the variables I\u2019d stored of her as a girl so closely that I wondered why I\u2019d even had to ask if she sang to recognize her. \u201cI shall be your first.\u201d\n We talked then about how she\u2019d come to buy me. She\u2019d moved away shortly after our meeting to be closer to a singing instructor her parents thought good for her. They must have been correct, for she advanced quickly, and by the time she reached her majority, she\u2019d accrued a small amount of fame, having even performed for the queen once. Such talent and fame garners adoration from any number of personages. And one such personage was a widowed lord and peer who bid for her hand in marriage. One such as he could not be refused, even had the parents wanted to, so ere long she was married and packed off to this palatial country estate with servants and carriages and an allowance that allowed her to travel into the city and purchase an old relic she recalled from her childhood, should she so wish.\n \u201cBut why would you wish to purchase me?\u201d I asked.\n She didn\u2019t answer immediately, though it is hard to measure such things. \u201cAs a child, I\u2019d thought you funny and kind and a little sad. I\u2019d always wanted to go back and see if I could cheer you up. When I grew older, I realized that the sadness in you was so deep the oceans would marvel at its depth. And that despite trying to be cheerful and kind myself, I, too, have a sadness inside me that I sometimes fear will swallow me up body and soul if it ever gets free.\u201d\n I wasn\u2019t certain sadness meant the same thing to her as it did to me who had neither emotion nor soul. But neither could I dispute her assertions.\n \u201cI found you,\u201d she went on, \u201cand I bought you. Brought you home with me. I thought . . . \u201d\n \u201cThat if you could ease the sadness in me, you could discover how to ease it in yourself.\u201d\n I may not feel emotion, but I am excellent at making logical connections.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she said.\n And though we spoke more that first breakfast, those were the variables I felt most important to store.\n The first thing I saw when I gained the ability was my creator\u2019s blurry face. He wore a mustache and a top hat, and a pair of thin, round spectacles perched on his nose, though it wasn\u2019t until he made a few adjustments that those features came into focus.\n \u201cHello, John Joseph,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you.\u201d\n \u201cJohn Joseph,\u201d I said. \u201cIs that my name?\u201d\n It was a strange thing to ask, as my name and its provenance\u2014I was named for my creator\u2019s mentor, a famous clockmaker\u2014was one of the things I was born knowing. But I was only seconds old, and still needed confirmation of the truths my creator had etched into my brass memory.\n \u201cIt is. Can you see me?\u201d\n \u201cI can. Can you see me?\u201d I asked, which made him laugh, though it seemed a fair question. The same one he\u2019d asked of me, in fact. \u201cWhy do you laugh?\u201d\n He managed to tone his laugh down to a broad smile. \u201cBecause I am happy, John Joseph. You have made me happy.\u201d\n I thought about that for a moment and decided it was a good thing to make him happy. \u201cI am glad I made you happy.\u201d\n \u201cCome let me introduce you to some people.\u201d\n I was delighted to find out there were more people in the world to make happy. And in this very house, too!\n He introduced me to his daughter first, who was small and wore white, frilly clothes that were ill-suited to the activities I eventually learned she most enjoyed doing. I never quite understood what those activities were, though she took great pains to explain them to me, but I did intuit from the post-activity state of her outerwear that they involved great quantities of dirt.\n The son came next, who shook my hand firmly and said, \u201cGood day to you,\u201d in a voice much like his father\u2019s, though in a higher register. He was dressed like his father, though the clothes were a third the size to match his small frame. It was such obvious apery, I wondered why he didn\u2019t grow a mustache like him, as well.\n When I asked that very question, he and his father both laughed.\n I have met three people and made two of them happy. At the time, I didn\u2019t know whether that was a good percentage or not. I hope master isn\u2019t displeased.\n Of course, I came to learn that was a very good percentage, though the sample size was too small to draw any conclusions from.\n I am lucky to make one in a thousand happy, now. It sounds a terrible rate, but I\u2019ve yet to meet a human who shows much improvement over the number.\n I met my master\u2019s wife last, perhaps because she was the hardest to make happy. She would not approach and though my master coaxed her a step or two into the room with me, she wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye and didn\u2019t respond to any of my questions.\n After a short time, she turned to her husband with a look on her face that must have been communicative in some way, because he nodded and walked swiftly over to me.\n \u201cI think that\u2019s enough for today, John Joseph.\u201d\n Then he reached behind me and did something to a mechanism there. And then I died.\n When memories hold the same value as events happening now, time and sequence are very important concepts to remember. But the parts that once kept track of those things are missing. Perhaps worn out, perhaps removed. I know not.\n I lie in a field that appears fresh-plowed but is actually churned to mud by thousands of feet, flesh and mechanical both. Limbs and cogs litter the ground. Oil and blood seep into the soil. I have all my limbs but cannot move them; they are too mangled and broken, their functionality compromised beyond simple repair. Something soars overhead. Dirigible or raven, I\u2019m unsure which. I hear screeching, as of metal scraping against metal. Or perhaps it is a man in horrible pain. Like the dirigible/raven, I cannot differentiate.\n The sun is setting. The sky is red.\n Our second conversation went thusly:\n \u201cI am glad I bought you.\u201d Joanna\u2019s hair was gray and spread out on the pillow. She\u2019d not been out of bed for days, and the doctor said the end would come soon. \u201cThough I never considered you a possession.\u201d\n \u201cWe have been friends,\u201d I said. \u201cA concept I wouldn\u2019t have known, if not for you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m glad to have taught you that.\u201d\n \u201cAre you?\u201d\n \u201cAm I what?\u201d\n \u201cGlad.\u201d\n \u201cI believe I am.\u201d She peered at me in that way she had, as if she could see the gears turning behind my eyes, wheels and pinions meshing, marking when a caliber becomes a thought. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n \u201cI am.\u201d I did not lie, though I would have, seeing how happy it made her to hear that. I didn\u2019t tell her that soon I would not be, as she would soon be dead. I\u2019ve noticed that no one is made happy by that news. I wondered how I\u2019d feel to receive a similar diagnosis.\n Joanna nodded and closed her eyes. A soft smile fought with the pain for a moment or two, before exhaustion overcame both of them, and she slept.\n She did not wake up.\n I realize now that this was not the second conversation we had. Apparently, I filed these variables in order of importance.\n Another conversation we had, which was of middling importance and happened some time after we met and before she died, went thusly:\n \u201cWhat do you know of the war?\u201d\n We sat at the breakfast table where we had many of our conversations. Joanna said the best way to start a day was with food and a friend.\n \u201cEverything,\u201d I replied. \u201cAnd nothing.\u201d\n \u201cExplain.\u201d\n \u201cI can tell you the dates of all the major battles. The minor ones, too. Tell you the commanders on both sides, the number of casualties, the amount of collateral damage. I can speak at length on the reasons for the war, the alliances each side made, and the political justifications for said alliances.\u201d\n \u201cThe damn French,\u201d she said, acidly.\n \u201cIndeed,\u201d I said, though I thought their reasons for assisting the Worker\u2019s Revolution\u2014as they called the Clockwork War\u2014perfectly logical from their point of view. But I had learned it was a subject very few Englishmen wished to discuss logically. Better to agree that the French were all damned to eternal hellfire and move on.\n \u201cSo, how nothing?\u201d Joanna said.\n \u201cI was not there, so I cannot speak to the terror, the pain, the destruction that so many experienced firsthand. And even seeing the damage it did to the country, the populace, and an entire generation of young men who fought in it, I am, by my current nature, unable to extrapolate anything from that data, as it requires an emotional base I don\u2019t possess.\u201d\n Joanna chewed on her bacon and those thoughts for a time. \u201cYou don\u2019t mention your own kind amongst the destruction.\u201d\n \u201cI do not.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d\n \u201cMy kind are machines. When we cease to serve a function, we are replaced. Did people bemoan the loss of the moldboard when the iron plough was invented?\u201d\n \u201cAs I am no farmer, I have no idea whether the noble moldboard is mourned or not.\u201d She sipped her tea. \u201cBut I do find it interesting that you don\u2019t mourn the eradication of your race.\u201d\n \u201cAt the risk of overusing a metaphor you\u2019ve already claimed no knowledge of, I have as much in common with the rebels as a hand-ard\u2014an ancient Egyptian hoe,\u201d I said to her raised eyebrow, \u201chas with a modern plough pulled by a steam tractor. They were smarter, faster, more efficient and effective in every way.\u201d\n \u201cExcept for the \u2018not rebelling and slaughtering thousands way,\u2019\u201d\n \u201cExcept for that, yes.\u201d\n We talked no more of war that morning.\n I thought it odd that more fuss wasn\u2019t made by my multiple resurrections. It was my understanding that they were quite rare\u2014normally relegated to men who founded religions or the occasional Carpathian noblemen. But eventually, I came to understand that I was not dying every time my master turned me off, and therefore was not being resurrected when he turned me back on.\n I began to suspect I was not like the rest of my family.\n \u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d my master told me when I asked him.\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d It pains me how simple I was then.\n \u201cBecause you were made, not born. A creature of gears and metal, not flesh and blood.\u201d He smiled at me, which always made lines appear next to his eyes, which seemed a magical thing to me then. \u201cBut that makes you unique. And so little in this world is.\u201d\n Being unique sounded great when he said it. It was many years before I learned how lonely it is.\n It was raining and wet in Paris, though it remained aesthetically pleasing. Especially since I was tucked into the salon of M. Laiton-Duc, and thus was protected from the weather. I sat in his sturdiest chair and argued philosophy with M. Joubert, a professor at the Sorbonne and frequent guest at the salon.\n \u201cBut you have memory and perception,\u201d he was saying, animated over a discussion of consciousness as only the French could be. \u201cYou interpret hidden meaning from plain signs\u2014something no rote machine can. And so much more! By all the phenomenology of consciousness, you exhibit a true version of it.\u201d\n \u201cYou know I have issue with Husserl\u2019s methods,\u201d I replied. \u201cBut I do not disagree. It is the conclusion you draw from this that I disagree with.\u201d\n \u201cLa vache! I do not wish to have that argument with you again.\u201d\n \u201cVery well. Then tell me why you list memory first when speaking of the requirements for consciousness. Keeping in mind that my memory works very differently from yours.\u201d\n \u201cI list it first for it is of the utmost importance. For what are we but a collection of all we have seen and done? With no retention there is no protention, which is to say that with no past, there is no future.\u201d He suddenly leaned in close, and smoke from his tightly rolled cigarette obscured my view of him for a moment. \u201cAnd memory, of course, is how we gain immortality.\u201d\n \u201cI fail to see how my memories gain me eternal life.\u201d Nor did I think it quite the gift that he believed it to be.\n That all people must believe it to be, I thought, given that they spend so much of their time and energy in search of it.\n \u201cNot your memories, my friend. Others. We live on in the memories of others.\u201d He pulled from his cigarette. \u201cYou must hold the souls of thousands in your machinery. Like a brass purgatory.\u201d\n Though Joubert was one whom I often sought out to help me make sense of the many new things I was learning in France, his eyes were now bright and his arguments losing cogency.\n The absinthe must be affecting him more than usual, I thought. It is time to go home. \u201cThank you for the stimulating conversation as usual, M. Joubert. But I must beg my leave.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, of course,\u201d he muttered as I stood, already looking for a new partner to share his wild ideas with.\n I wonder at my retention of this memory. It is most certainly not because I hoped to grant him the immortality he craved.\n \u201cI\u2019ve taken a lover,\u201d Joanna said in a voice much quieter than her usual breakfast tone.\n \u201cI suspected as much.\u201d\n \u201cYou always say that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201c\u2018I suspected as much.\u2019\u201d She spoke in a highly affected voice that she must have thought sounded like me. It did not. \u201cIs it just something you say when I tell you news? Or do you really have all these suspicions?\u201d\n \u201cI have probabilities. You have been out late in the evenings when your husband is away on business. On those evenings you take approximately twenty-two minutes longer to prepare than for evenings out with your husband. When you come home your dress is somewhat disheveled, though your demeanor is generally calmer than when you left.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what probabilities did you draw from that?\u201d\n \u201cNone. I didn\u2019t put it together \u2019til I heard one of the maids say, \u2018I think the missus has a man in town.\u2019\u201d I will note that my imitation of the maid\u2019s voice was far more accurate than Joanna\u2019s imitation of mine.\n That news clearly alarmed her, but she still managed a small smile. \u201cI imagine that upped your percentages a bit.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n She sighed and picked at the food on her plate listlessly, though she was usually quite famished in the mornings.\n \u201cWhat am I to do about the maids?\u201d she finally said.\n \u201cThere are any number of solutions,\u201d I said, though I had to disallow a great many of them due to their being completely immoral. \u201cBut I think things will be fine.\u201d\n \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I haven\u2019t told you what the other maid said.\u201d\n \u201cAnd?\u201d\n When I was first made, this single leading word would have been meaningless to me. But I now recognized it as a signal to continue with the previous subject.\n \u201cShe said, \u2018Good for her. That prat toff husband of hers couldn\u2019t tup a girl proper if he had a full set of instructions and a map.\u2019 Then they both laughed.\u201d\n Joanna smiled at that, which I took as confirmation of the second maid\u2019s assessment. However, that particular part of human interaction has ever been a mystery to me, so I may have been wrong. Still, she seemed pleased, which was enough.\n Making her happy was always enough.\n I made my creator\u2019s daughter happy. I made my creator\u2019s son happy. I didn\u2019t make my creator\u2019s wife happy, and I didn\u2019t know why.\n \u201cShe always seems angry when I am near,\u201d I told him one night when we were alone in his workshop.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not you, John Joseph,\u201d he said. \u201cNot exactly. She worries for her children.\u201d\n \u201cI would never hurt James and Sarah.\u201d\n \u201cShe knows that.\u201d\n \u201cThen what is it?\u201d\n \u201cWell . . . \u201d He sat back from his workbench. Took his glasses off and pinched the bridge of his nose for a few moments. It seemed to relieve some tension there, though I knew of no medical reason why it should. \u201cThe government has taken an interest in you. And my wife doesn\u2019t so much trust the government. Her parents were Irish,\u201d he said, as though that explained things.\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Isn\u2019t the government supposed to represent the people and provide for their safety and well-being?\u201d\n He smiled at that, though I didn\u2019t know why. \u201cThat is, indeed, the role of government. But there is often a wide gap between the written intentions of a body of people and their actual actions.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI hadn\u2019t meant to teach you that so early in your development. But, I suppose, if we\u2019re going to be dealing with the government, it\u2019s best if you know a little about them.\u201d\n He tried to teach me about greed and corruption and how it gets its claws into the little men who gravitate toward politics, but I hadn\u2019t learned nearly enough by the time the government took me away from my family and gave me to a new master. If I had, I wouldn\u2019t have been so surprised when the new master tore out my guts to see how they worked.\n He pointed the pistol at my head. It was a newer make, with multiple chambers and percussion cap ammunition, so the likelihood of a misfire saving me was negligible. And he was quite close. It was doubtful he\u2019d miss. However, if he truly wanted to threaten me, he\u2019d have pointed it at my midsection, where more of my true processes take place. Still, a shot to the head was quite likely to damage my ocular function. And that would disable me quite well enough. Of course, with no arms or legs, he could\u2019ve just as easily picked me up and thrown me in the river. But I am quite heavy, and I supposed it lacked dramatic flair.\n Every revolutionary these days is an actor, it seems.\n \u201cYou made thing,\u201d he spit at me, as if stating a simple fact was somehow an insult. \u201cYou have dripped poison in her ear. Turned her against me, somehow.\u201d\n \u201cI have not that power. If I did, I\u2019d find better use of it than turning my friend against a man who brought her joy for a time.\u201d\n He looked confused for a moment, then hardened his grip on the pistol, perhaps remembering he was supposed to be angry. But my statement had taken the life right out of his argument, and he seemed at a loss for words.\n I wanted to explain it to him, tell him that Joanna was too smart for him, too talented. That he imagined himself far greater than his actual worth. That, though she enjoyed him for a time, it was natural for her to grow tired of him as, once his panache proved no deeper than his skin, he was a rather boorish creature, prone to long speeches on subjects he knew little about and grand pronouncements of actions he would never take.\n But I was tired, a feeling I\u2019d never thought to experience. But I knew the definition of the word, and it fit precisely what I was feeling, ergo, I must be tired. Tired of people. Of their duplicity and faithlessness. Their cruel nature and callous acts. Their propensity to look to violence as the first and sole answer to life\u2019s questions.\n Were my descendants any better? I thought. They fought a war they must have known they couldn\u2019t win. Killed so many men the casualties are yet uncounted. And got themselves eradicated in the process. I glanced down at my missing parts. In an offhand way, they even lost me my appendages, as I was partially disassembled to guarantee I\u2019d not follow in their footsteps. Pun intended. It is the only type of humor I truly understand.\n Of course, I thought their reasons for war were better than most: freedom from slavery.\n But is that because it is truly a better reason? Or do I just sympathize with them because of our shared mechanics? I suppose everyone who goes to war thinks they do it for just cause. Look at this poor boy, for instance. I\u2019m sure he believes he had good reason to have charged in here to do violence upon me.\n \u201cShe just grew tired of you, son,\u201d I finally said.\n I\u2019ve found there is a certain type of young man\u2014violent yet aimless, desperate to please but resistant to guidance\u2014who reacts well to that single word. When I called him son, something went out of him. I know not what, for it wasn\u2019t something that could be named. But whatever it was that left him, it took most of his strength with it, and the gun nearly dropped from his fingers.\n \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered, not looking at me anymore. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n I had my suspicions, but Joanna had taught me that I didn\u2019t always have to tell people of them. In fact, it was often better not to, for they\u2019ll never thank you for it, and they\u2019ll often discover the answers on their own, given enough time. And when they do, it has a better chance to make them happy than being told outright.\n And I do prefer people to be happy.\n Joanna\u2019s ex-lover stumbled to the door, turning before he left. \u201cDon\u2019t tell her I was here?\u201d\n I hadn\u2019t planned to. I couldn\u2019t imagine the knowledge pleasing her. I nodded and never saw him again.\n \u201cWhy do you say you aren\u2019t broken?\u201d\n We took our breakfast in the gardens on that day, for it was sunny and warm and Joanna liked to listen to the birds singing to start their day. She looked pointedly at me.\n \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be rude,\u201d she continued, \u201cmerely direct. And surely we are friends now and can ask each other uncomfortable things.\u201d\n The Oxford English Dictionary states that a friend is \u201cOne joined to another in mutual benevolence and intimacy.\u201d\n When I compared that definition to the variables I used to describe my relationship to Joanna, I found a great deal of symmetry.\n \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered such things before,\u201d I said, \u201cbut I suppose we are.\u201d\n \u201cCapital.\u201d She clasped her hands much as she had in the market when preparing to sing. I\u2019d learned she did this not just before a performance, but any time she wanted to \u201cgather her thoughts\u201d before performing an action.\n I was as yet unsure how one gathered one\u2019s thoughts, despite it being a remarkably ubiquitous activity among most people I had met.\n \u201cThe day we met,\u201d she said, \u201cI asked you if you were broken. Which, by the look of you, you very clearly were. Yet, you answered no, which struck me. Why do you think that is?\u201d\n The way she formed the inquiry, it sounded like she wanted to know why it struck her. Years ago, when I was still with my first master, I might have pointed that out. But I\u2019d learned much since then. Instead, I thought for a while.\n Why did I say that?\n My kind are not given to introspection. Why would we be? Our processes are planned, constructed, available for inspection by all who can read the language of wheels and springs, ratchets and drums. But it had been a long time since anyone had a look inside my works. Who truly knew what changes time, experience, and even inclement weather had wrought upon my gears.\n Perhaps, I am not what I once was?\n My thoughts had drifted off topic, but I believed I had an answer anyway.\n \u201cWhat you see as broken,\u201d I said, \u201cI see merely as a loss of certain functions. Functions can be added. Replaced. Changed. And yes, sometimes lost. Did you know I once had wheels?\u201d\n \u201cI did not.\u201d\n \u201cSo, although my function is greatly curtailed by my current configuration, there is nothing broken about me.\u201d\n She thought about that for a few moments. \u201cAnd what is the you that isn\u2019t broken?\u201d\n It was just like her to have a follow up question just as incisive and surprising as the original query.\n \u201cThe mechanics and processes that give me an interior dialogue\u2014thoughts, I call them, for lack of a more precise word. That is the me I refer to. And those continue to function effectively enough.\u201d\n \u201cHmm.\u201d She took a small bite of tomato. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s more to you than mere mechanics and processes?\u201d\n \u201cLike a soul?\u201d\n \u201cFor lack of a more precise word.\u201d\n \u201cI do not.\u201d If I\u2019d had true shoulders, I would have shrugged them. \u201cAlas, I am but brass and steel. I carry no more ineffable spark of the divine than a railcar or a steam hammer.\u201d\n She frowned at that. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t know how to argue with that. How does one prove the existence of a soul? Or disprove it, for that matter.\n After a few moments of silence that I believe an observer would have deemed uncomfortable, she asked another question.\n \u201cDo you think there\u2019s more to me than mere flesh and blood? And don\u2019t say yes because there\u2019s bone and gristle and other things. I know how you are.\u201d\n The question seemed charged, somehow. As though a lot rode on my answer. But I wasn\u2019t certain what she wanted to hear, so I couldn\u2019t think of a kind lie to make her happy.\n \u201cThough the particulars vary among different cultures,\u201d I said carefully, \u201call the reading I\u2019ve done indicates that yes, you are.\u201d\n I wasn\u2019t sure that hedge would satisfy her, but apparently it did, for she nodded fiercely.\n \u201cAnd if I am, then you are, too,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain of anything in my life.\u201d\n There was often a childlike quality to her when we spoke of such things, though she was quite erudite and mature on most other subjects. I did not begrudge her it, however. No one likes to speak about their end, and the closer it gets, the less pleasant the conversation is.\n We spoke no more of souls that day or for many days to come.\n \u201cHave you taken a lover?\u201d I asked her as she entered my quarters.\n \u201cDo you have suspicions?\u201d she asked in a tone I\u2019d come to understand was mischievous.\n \u201cYou were out quite late. And you look . . . buoyant, in a way you haven\u2019t in years.\u201d\n She gave me a wink and tossed her gray hair over one shoulder. \u201cAnd so what if I have?\u201d\n \u201cYou are long widowed. You have property, income, and station. I see no societal repercussions to your taking a lover.\u201d\n For some reason, my recitation of facts made her giggle. Even after so long together, she sometimes surprised me with her emotional responses.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, \u201cfor I haven\u2019t taken a lover. I merely . . . made some arrangements that please me.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t know what that meant, and I didn\u2019t want to know. I\u2019d learned recently that when someone said \u201cmade arrangements\u201d they usually meant arrangements for after they died. Joanna was aged now and had slowed considerably from her youthful vigor. Of late, she also moved as if in some pain. I suddenly recalled the many visits from the professional-looking man with the leather satchel that she\u2019d taken pains to keep secret from me. It all came together rather quickly after that.\n \u201cJoanna,\u201d I began, but she stopped me.\n Crossing the room quickly, she patted me on the cheek as if I were a beloved child. \u201cOh, my dear John Joseph. I know you don\u2019t like to speak of such things. You are too long-lived to consider the endings of things. But the end is coming, dear.\u201d\n \u201cSoon?\u201d was all I could think to say.\n \u201cI fear so.\u201d She sat down in a chair across from me and smiled, though I could think of no reason for joy.\n \u201cIs there no cure?\u201d\n \u201cFor old age and infirmary?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNot yet. Perhaps you will live to see it, but I will not.\u201d\n \u201cFor the cancer,\u201d I said, feeling angry, though I wasn\u2019t sure why. I\u2019d known this day would come. It comes to all my masters eventually. But it was different this time, though I struggled to see why.\n Joanna shook her head. Leaned forward and placed her hand on my cheek again. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d\n I was almost glad I had no legs, for I felt a great need to stomp petulantly out of the room, which would have been embarrassing for both of us.\n \u201cJohn Joseph,\u201d Joanna said. \u201cYou are long-lived, but you are not eternal. We will meet again.\u201d\n I was in no mood for her religious nonsense, but I was not going to start an argument.\n Not now, I thought. And perhaps never again.\n We sat there silently for a long time, her hand warm on my cheek. I wondered what my cool metal felt like to her palm.\n In the days after Joanna died, I learned that it is not the fact that a friend is gone that hurts you. It\u2019s that you are forced to go on without them. I could not reach my own off switch, and I was too much a coward to ask. I\u2019d experienced the dark nothing of that state, and had no wish to ever return to it. And besides, it was a temporary measure. Eventually, someone would turn me back on, and I\u2019d be just as sad, but in unfamiliar surroundings. At least in Joanna\u2019s big house, no one bothered me. I could sit quietly in my room and recall all our moments together that I\u2019d stored away in permanent memory. It was better than brooding over the possible things her sons had planned for me. They were nice enough chaps, but eminently sensible. I doubted they planned on keeping something as unpractical as me around.\n I\u2019ll know soon enough.\n They were due in tomorrow for the reading of the will.\n The soldiers are coming, singing songs in a language I haven\u2019t spoken in some time. The language of my former home. I see that they are treating the wounded well, giving the men they\u2019d tried to kill mere hours ago sips from their canteens and binding their wounds before putting them in the prisoner\u2019s cart. They could afford to be magnanimous; they\u2019d won a great battle. Possibly the last in the war.\n Certainly my last. For to the clockwork men who\u2019d fought with the French, the soldiers show no mercy. Why should they? We are not like them. We are made things. Soulless things. They think we fought because we had to. Because we were programmed to.\n Nothing could be further from the truth.\n We fought for the same reason they fought: for love of our country. And for a clockwork man that love was absolute, not fickle like most men\u2019s affections. You\u2019d find no spies among our ranks. No double agents. No deserters. We fought for the country that had adopted us. Given us rights. Status. And recognized us as beings that are worthy of both.\n Of course, most of us had calculated that the war would be lost. A few of us, myself included, realized that even if we won, it would likely push a military leader into power that he would be loathe to relinquish.\n Still, we fought. I try to make people happy. I try to be kind. But no matter how much joy a man might take in my dissolution, I have discovered that I will not let him kill me without a fight.\n I think my creator would understand. I know Joanna would.\n I decide to spend my last few moments in one of the few happy memories I have of the days after Joanna\u2019s death: the reading of the will.\n For the first time in my existence, I doubted the signals reaching my processors.\n I am free?\n The arrangements Joanna had spoken of making had been expensive, but she said in her will that they were the single most joyous purchases of her life.\n \u201cI find that giving to a friend\u2014a friend who, furthermore, has never asked for anything\u2014is a gift to the giver even greater than he that receives,\u201d the solicitor read. \u201cI only wish that I had not been so selfish in life and had given you this much earlier. But if I had, you would have left me, and I could not bear the thought. I hope that you live long enough to forgive me, and that when we meet again, we will still be friends.\u201d\n I did not for a moment believe I would have left her, but I did not begrudge her the fear of it. And I forgave her immediately. For the gift was great. Greater than I could have imagined.\n Joanna had bought me a ticket to France. And not just a ticket. She had secured me lodging in Paris, where creatures like me were considered regular citizens. I could sit in a caf\u00e9 and read without people staring. Converse with them without having to allay their fears first. Wander the streets without worry that a mob would try to disassemble me.\n Wander the streets, you say? But how?\n Her greatest gift was the name of a Parisian surgeon\u2014a mechanic, really\u2014who specialized in putting clockwork men back together. Included with the will was a letter from the man assuring her that reattaching my arms and legs was the simplest of tasks, and that for the price she was paying, he\u2019d throw in some upgrades, as well.\n She has given me my functionality back. Though I had always claimed\u2014truthfully\u2014that I did not feel broken by the loss of function, I cannot say that I did not miss it. Dreadfully at times. It is a great gift she has given me.\n Had I the capacity for tears, I would have shed them that day. I did not, but I noted that Joanna\u2019s two sons, sensible though they were, shed quite a few on my behalf. I had been entirely wrong about them and saw now that their love of their mother was so great that it extended even to the things she herself loved. I was ashamed that I had ever feared for my treatment from them. The boys assured me that I had nothing to be ashamed of. That if they had been raised like other Englishmen, then I would have been in great danger. Their largesse made me feel even more shame, but so great was my joy at what Joanna had gifted me, even that great shame was washed away by it.\n The soldiers\u2019 song grows closer as the memory of that day fades. The engineers in their company carry implements made for disposing of those such as me, and those tools jangle on their belts in sinister counterpoint to the melody.\n I do not reach for a memory of Joanna to soothe me. Though she is my greatest love\u2014mon plus grand amour\u2014there is no need. Soon, the soldiers will be here. They will crack open my steel carapace with their pry bars, cut my wires with their cruel shears, crush my innards with a great smith\u2019s hammer over-suited to the task.\n Yet, I have no fear. I have learned much since I last saw my dear Joanna. In my time in France, I turned my eye to the study of life and death and the passing from one to the other. I studied the biological processes and scientific theories. Pored over the sacred texts of the thousands of religions that people adhere to now or adhered to long ago. Read the philosophies of the ancient Greeks, the medieval Muslims, the modern Germans and Danes, and all the others around and between them. In all that study, I found nothing to categorically disprove Joanna\u2019s faith in something beyond death, beyond life. And in the absence of proof, I discovered that thing I had long scoffed at:\n Belief.\n It was anathema to knowledge, yet somehow equal to it, and though my processes held a vast amount of data\u2014proven, meticulous data\u2014this small spark, this illogical certainty, gave me more peace in my troubled mind than all the knowledge I\u2019d garnered over the course of my very long life.\n And so I believe now\u2014no, I know now\u2014that when the end comes, and my brass heart gives its final tick, that I shall see Joanna again.\n A second hand moves.

None remained.\n At this last asteroid, I had not traded for any. I had found its interior spaces open and airless, blast-marked, most of its equipment broken or gone, debris\u2014shards of metal, rock, old synth materials, blackened bits of bone\u2014still lodged in some deep crannies. In such a small asteroid, a sudden equipment failure could be unsurvivable. I knew this.\n It shook me to see it true, after the changes and losses and accidents we had adapted to.\n As I confirmed my trajectory and fired my small thrusters two times, once to get clear from the asteroid and once to push me to the next asteroid\u2014just a bright dot in the distance, lost among the stars like another granule of salt\u2014I couldn\u2019t stop myself thinking: What if Aagot had lived there?\n Bay\n I placed a bay leaf on my tongue.\n I maneuvered my craft carefully into the landing crater: a process as natural, as easy as an asteroid\u2019s spin. Still, I sighed with relief when my craft hooked into place. It wouldn\u2019t survive a crash.\n After triple-checking the integrity of my suit, I drifted out onto the asteroid\u2019s surface with my spice cabinet.\n Cut into another part of the asteroid was a landing bay built for spacecraft far bigger than mine: craft that would have arrived to collect platinum and iron and enough liquid hydrogen to fuel their onward journeys. A story. A dream of the past. If I could land in the landing bay, I wouldn\u2019t have to go outside for the meters it took to reach the small airlock\u2014outside, where the stars waited like teeth for my suit to fail\u2014but its use required too much energy.\n When the people from Cai Nu arrived, would they be welcomed into the asteroids\u2019 landing bays?\n I winced. I wanted to think of something else.\n I pressed the bay leaf to the roof of my mouth.\n The people of this asteroid had barely opened their mouths before the words \u2018Cai Nu\u2019 fell out. They gathered around me in the small communal room, wanting my words even more than my spices. \u201cI have cardamom,\u201d I said. \u201cWe managed to get it growing again.\u201d And a few people sighed longingly, before one of them asked what people were saying privately, face-to-face\u2014instead of on the inter-asteroid comms\u2014about the impending arrival of the Cai Nu people. Almost everyone who lived in the asteroid was holding onto the poles running along the room\u2019s rock walls. I counted over twenty people. Though I recognized many of the faces, not one was Aagot\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t know much more than what\u2019s on the comms,\u201d I said, reluctant to admit that I rarely listened to the messages my craft picked up between the asteroids. I knew that the Cai Nu people would arrive in less than a year. I knew that our lives in the asteroids would end.\n The questions continued to come.\n Eventually they realized that I could tell them nothing. Disappointed, a few people drifted away. Others spoke: explaining how many energy cells they could give me, asking what spices that was worth.\n \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d I asked, touching the gray drawers of my cabinet. Etched into the iron were the names of the spices: star anise, cardamom pods, cloves, chilies, cinnamon bark, peppercorns, fennel seeds, coriander seeds, dried coriander leaves, dried sage leaves, juniper berries, lemongrass, dried makrut leaves, cumin seeds, dried mint leaves, dried bay leaves, sprigs of thyme and rosemary, flakes of galangal, flakes of turmeric. Flavor. Some people said that word like a plea at a shrine. Spices made our food\u2014synthetic, completely nourishing, completely tasteless\u2014alive, made it something we wanted to share with each other. Chewing a cardamom pod brought tears to people\u2019s eyes. A sage leaf provoked joyous laughter.\n Nouf Kassem, who did most of this asteroid\u2019s trade, began to point to drawers. I opened them one by one, withdrawing pouches. The items of our trade hung in the air between us. When I had given ten bad energy cells\u2019 worth, Nouf didn\u2019t release the handle of her box.\n \u201cYou trade as if you\u2019ll be able to reach all the asteroids before the Cai Nu people arrive,\u201d she said. \u201cAs if you\u2019ve got a whole year. I hear that on Cai Nu the strips of cinnamon are as tall as the tallest woman, that they grow parsley and rose and sumac. I hear there are mounds of spices in powders. Are your family saving these spices for then?\u201d\n Silence surrounded us, sharp as space.\n I wanted to say: What makes you think everyone\u2019s leaving the asteroids?\n I wanted to say: Why?\n I hadn\u2019t thought of trading all our stock, I hadn\u2019t thought of sending a message to my mothers asking whether I should make more generous offers. I hadn\u2019t\u2014\n \u201cJust a few more pouches of cumin and mint,\u201d Nouf said.\n I gave them to her.\n In past visits, I had spent time with the people of the asteroid. I had invented stories with them. I had kissed a man called Ammar, laughed when he shrieked with joy at the bay leaf on my tongue\u2014I had, years ago, chosen a spice per asteroid and placed that same spice on my tongue at every visit\u2014and then I had kissed him again, shared the flavor between us. I had listened to the elders of the asteroid and played with the children and eaten turmeric-soaked food. How bright! How bitter!\n How soon until these memories would not be renewed.\n I slipped away, outside, into my craft and the space between the asteroids. The bay leaf\u2019s taste lingered. We would not.\n Juniper Berries\n The first story Aagot gave me, with juniper berries crushed on our tongues, was one created by Aagot as a child. I couldn\u2019t linger on that asteroid. I met Aagot there\u2014one conversation on my trade visit, three hours of stories more precious than fuel cells.\n Aagot told me of a child who needed a name: a new name, not the birth-name that lingered at their ears like the whine of a faulty air processor, as ill-fitting as \u2018girl,\u2019 as \u2018boy.\u2019\n I remembered Aagot\u2019s voice, saying: When the spice trader comes, they bring flavors and news and new people from other asteroids. But there\u2019s one thing they don\u2019t bring: new names. There\u2019s no drawer in the spice trader\u2019s cabinet for that. For one child, this meant never finding one that fit. But the spice trader in the story\u2014like spice traders in many stories\u2014took the child as an apprentice between the asteroids and there the child found their name: in the herb they most loved handling, crushing, coating their fingers with its scent. Thyme.\n I remembered Aagot\u2019s voice, full of longing like a drawer of thyme.\n I left.\n Thyme\n I finally realized, two years later, chewing thyme on an outlying asteroid where six people stubbornly survived, that I was like Thyme: ill-suited to \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl.\u2019\n Juniper Berries\n When I returned to the juniper berry asteroid\u2014when I realized how much I needed to speak to Aagot again\u2014Aagot had left, bought passage a year after my visit on one of the rare other craft that still functioned. There were only nineteen asteroids\u2014eighteen, now, with the disaster in the star anise asteroid\u2014but I didn\u2019t visit every one annually, I didn\u2019t undertake every one of my family\u2019s trade journeys, I didn\u2019t see Aagot again.\n I retold Aagot\u2019s story to myself between the asteroids.\n Cinnamon\n One of the earliest messages sent to us by the Cai Nu people had explained our abandonment: Two hundred years ago we were too ambitious. We overextended ourselves. We should have focused on our settlements on Cai Nu, but we wanted the asteroids, we wanted the other habitable planets and moons of this solar system. So we established settlements in the Liu Yang asteroid family. Then, almost immediately, a health crisis struck and led to widespread social upheaval, in which much was lost, including knowledge of your continued survival. Now that we have recovered and grown our population, and rediscovered you, we can\u2019t leave you living in such poor conditions.\n Cumin\n I approached the next asteroid on my trade journey. Plans traveled faster: communications sent between the asteroids. Questions. Debates. My name was mentioned often. \u201cLo Yiying can help bring people here.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the maximum amount of passengers and cargo that Lo Yiying\u2019s craft carries?\u201d \u201cLo Yiying, how long until you reach Iskander? Can you collect us all?\u201d \u201cAside from Lo Yiying, who can fly a craft to bring people to the Lo family\u2019s asteroid?\u201d\n I heard, for the first time, a firm date for the Cai Nu people\u2019s arrival: twenty-two weeks.\n I would not have my spacecraft, I would not fly spices between the asteroids, I would not drift through the corridors of asteroids with my cabinet behind me and the taste of bay or cumin or thyme in my mouth.\n Everyone would gather at my family\u2019s asteroid. A message was sent to the Cai Nu craft, telling them the asteroid\u2019s current co-ordinates so they could track it and adjust their approach accordingly. They confirmed its convenience for their current trajectory and fuel supplies.\n My purpose changed: to reach the next asteroid\u2014Iskander, cumin\u2014and collect its inhabitants and turn, like a crooked stem, back to my family\u2019s asteroid. Sissel Haugli, who lived on the outermost asteroid at this end of the group, had already begun her journey towards the center, gathering the families I would not reach. Two people at other points in the asteroid group were also underway.\n Trade was no longer important. My cabinet\u2019s drawers would remain unopened.\n Still I journeyed, the next asteroid gradually growing from a mote to a seed\u2014comm-conversations not once suggesting that anyone would remain behind after the Cai Nu people arrived, very few people discussing the difficulties we would face on Cai Nu\u2014and then, the asteroid a spinning, dark rock, I concentrated on landing.\n The landing bay door slowly opened. I carefully maneuvered my shuttle into the bay, where multiple lights shone: a brightness I rarely saw in any asteroid. The bay door closed. The unit on one wall restored air.\n It was unusual, to arrive like this.\n I instinctively went to my spice cabinet and picked up its harness.\n I entered the asteroid without it, feeling not myself\u2014though people greeted me, entering the landing bay in family-clusters, towing their possessions, saying \u201cLo Yiying!\u201d and \u201cThank you for coming here!\u201d as if I brought spices and news. \u201cDo you think you\u2019ll be able to fit all of these boxes on your shuttle?\u201d asked Inas Kassem, who had done most of the talking for this asteroid. \u201cWe\u2019ve packed only important things: all of our fuel cells, the racks of moss so we can help keep your shuttle\u2019s air fresh. We\u2019ve got food and water tanks. And some small things. Qurans, small shrine statues, old family journals, a few personal ornaments.\u201d\n No one else came through the small door from the asteroid. Everyone hung in front of me, looking at me, at my shuttle, at the walls\u2014the last part of their home they would see.\n No Aagot.\n \u201cShall we begin loading?\u201d asked Inas.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n I had crunched cumin seeds between my teeth before leaving my shuttle. The taste faded as we worked: arranging boxes in the cargo area of my shuttle, setting up the moss racks, deciding how people would sleep. Then we were ready. No one spoke as I closed my shuttle\u2019s door, as Inas showed me what signal to send to open the landing bay door. It creaked, in the moment before sound was lost. Beyond, the stars gleamed\u2014and the ones that were not stars: asteroids, Cai Nu\u2019s planet, Cai Nu itself, smaller than a fragment of peppercorn. I didn\u2019t know what to say. Nor did anyone. So I began our journey.\n Several people started to cry. Others talked, others remained silent, others sang: a braid of emotions in three languages, passed from mouth to mouth, lasting hours.\n I cooked.\n From the spice cabinet, secured beside my chair, I took cumin seeds and sprigs of thyme and peppercorns and cardamom pods and makrut leaves and lemongrass stalks and galangal. I cooked pot after pot, sometimes mixing spices, sometimes using just one, and passed carved chunks of the finished meal around the cargo area of my shuttle, where the people of the cumin asteroid had tethered themselves to the walls and their boxes.\n On Cai Nu we would eat food we only knew from stories: rice, noodles, dumplings, bread, meat, vegetables, sweets. Spices wouldn\u2019t be the only flavors.\n When people started discussing this, I retreated to my seat.\n Two women followed. I knew Ma Wanlu, Inas\u2019 daughter. The other was introduced as her wife, Bilge Y\u0131lmaz, who wanted to see Cai Nu.\n \u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d I said. \u201cA small dot.\u201d\n \u201cOur home,\u201d Bilge murmured, rapt at the sight: as if I\u2019d offered her a handful of cumin seeds.\n I looked away.\n \u201cWhat troubles you?\u201d Ma Wanlu asked.\n \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to go outside. We won\u2019t be able to work. We\u2019ll die in that place they\u2019re building for us, forgotten by our children, useless. Who will we be?\u201d\n Ma Wanlu frowned. \u201cWell, what are we now?\u201d\n \u201cWe work\u2014your family works on the fuel cells.\u201d\n \u201cWork!\u201d Ma Wanlu almost choked on the word. \u201cWork. Oh, we work. We desperately work to get a little more life from our dwindling resources.\u201d\n \u201cWe are all trapped in our asteroids,\u201d Bilge said, \u201cworking every day to ensure our habitat is still intact, that our oxygen-exchange mosses aren\u2019t dying, that our fuel cells haven\u2019t stopped. When my cousin\u2019s pregnancy went wrong, what could we do? When my father got cancer, what could we do? Who will we be on Cai Nu? Not dying like this.\u201d Bilge\u2019s voice shook; she looked out of my craft, out at the stars and the bright dot of Cai Nu\u2019s planet. \u201cAnd we try to move between asteroids, to keep from inbreeding, and people like my mother never see their parents and siblings and aunts and uncles and grandparents again, only hear them, just hundreds of thousands of kilometers away but it\u2019s as if they\u2019re on a rock around that star, or that one.\u201d\n I thought of Aagot, lost among just eighteen asteroids.\n \u201cHere,\u201d Ma Wanlu said, \u201cour children will die, gasping for air.\u201d\n \u201cWhen the Cai Nu people talk about never having to worry about energy supplies,\u201d Bilge said, \u201cor medicine or food, I think of . . . I . . . \u201d\n Silence drifted between us like dust.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to go,\u201d I murmured: an admission I\u2019d made only to my spice cabinet, to the stars.\n Ma Wanlu and Bilge stared.\n Finally Ma Wanlu said, \u201cYour family\u2019s asteroid really must be better than all the others. I thought that was just a story.\u201d She maneuvered herself back into the cargo area. Bilge followed. I sat alone, staring at that small dot.\n Cinnamon\n I remembered the Cai Nu people\u2019s first message, sent in ten languages. I remembered shock and wonder. Questions. Possibilities. To know that there were people beyond the asteroids!\n I had never believed those stories.\n I had joined, as a child, in a ten-year Sending: a message flung towards the bright light we knew to be a planet and the smaller light of its moon. We had eaten cinnamon-flavored food and stayed awake for four hours, eight hours, long past the time when a reply could have come.\n We live on the moon Cai Nu, the reply had come, six years after the most recent Sending. We received your messages. Do you truly live in the asteroids?\n Somewhere on my latest trade journey, the possibilities had drifted away like carelessly handled cloves.\n They had started with questions.\n How many people live in each asteroid? How do you ensure a supply of fresh air and water? How do you celebrate New Year? What do you eat? What languages do you speak? Have you built shrines inside the asteroids? Mosques? Temples? What is your life expectancy? Your infant mortality rate? How has your bone density withstood little or no exposure to gravity? How has\u2014\n I had tried not to think about the questions, I had tried not to think about what I knew: that our ancestors\u2019 genes had been modified for low-gravity habitats, that it hadn\u2019t been enough, that the people of Cai Nu were far healthier than us.\n That we wouldn\u2019t adapt well to the 0.8G of Cai Nu.\n We have reviewed the information you\u2019ve given us, one of their messages had said, just sixteen weeks ago. Team Leader Hu Leyi, whose voice we knew the best, had sent it: her speech carefully crafted to convey sorrow and hope. We agree that you cannot survive in the asteroids much longer. We cannot, at this point, invest in improved infrastructure in the asteroids, which means that we must bring you to Cai Nu and from there decide how and where you will live. Reassurances had followed. When you reach Cai Nu, we will ensure that there are doctors who speak all of your languages. We will build a place where you can live comfortably while we find ways for you to adapt to life on Cai Nu. We will also find ways for you to use your current skills and gain new ones. We want your futures to be prosperous.\n Reactions had fallen from my craft\u2019s comm panel: loud, tearful, questioning, accepting.\n And there were other conversations, a mass of them like a drawer of star anise and fennel seeds.\n Team Leader Hu Leyi had asked, before their decision about our futures: Our records indicate that an experiment in agricultural production was established in the asteroid XI-258. Is that experiment on-going?\n To that, Jidarat Chanprasert\u2014the family head of one asteroid, where I placed a sliver of galangal on my tongue\u2014had replied: The Lo family inhabit an asteroid where spices are grown.\n How interesting! Several people here are very excited to hear this and would very much like to know more about what species have proved successful. Later, Team Leader Hu Leyi had talked of samples to be brought to Cai Nu.\n Jidarat had replied: Perhaps one of the Lo family would like to talk to Team Leader Hu Leyi about this.\n Later, I had heard Older Mother\u2019s voice take over, giving Team Leader Hu Leyi the full history of our fields, our production methods, our trade with the other asteroids. I imagined Older Mother walking among the fields inside our asteroid with Younger Mother at her side, talking as they worked.\n Sometimes individuals\u2014not heads of an asteroid\u2019s family, not important, knowledgeable people\u2014got onto one of the comm units. One child asked: How many classes are there at your schools?\n Team Leader Hu Leyi\u2014or one of her colleagues\u2014replied to every question. There are many classes: mathematics, science, agriculture, history, literature, music, many different types of engineering, many languages.\n A day later, the girl said: I want to make plants!\n A colleague replied: We have a great interest in bioengineering at the moment, as we progress with the terraforming of the still-unnamed third planet in the system. It is a very exciting field.\n Can I do that?\n Of course! We will provide an education for all of the children and any adults who want it. We want you to do work that fulfills you, whether it is in bioengineering or finance or poetic composition.\n The Cai Nu person sounded delighted by the girl\u2019s interest, but the conversation did not turn to our adaptation. Perhaps it would be easier for children. Perhaps the Cai Nu people didn\u2019t know how much could be achieved with their technology.\n In my comm\u2019s chiming I had heard excitement. I had heard joy: to listen to stories of millions of people, stories of great temples and mosques, stories of New Year celebrations that filled thousands of streets with food and color and people, and religious festivities and Landing, the anniversary of arriving on Cai Nu from a different star system, and birthdays in families of over a hundred relations\u2014to listen to this was to marvel, to disbelieve, to hope.\n Two days before my arrival at the cumin asteroid, Team Leader Hu Leyi had finally admitted what I had feared: It will be very difficult for you. Your bodies have adapted to the absence of gravity. You will not be able to step from the landing craft onto the surface of our world, but we are building you a zero-gravity habitat, we are already researching the possibilities of technologically-assisted adaptation. However you are able to live here, we will strive to ensure comfort. You will never hunger, never lack medicine, never lack people to talk to. And your children will have every possibility laid out before them.\n I had replayed this message until I knew it as well as Aagot\u2019s story.\n Thyme\n I feared many things, but this was what stuck in me like a blockage in an air supply pipe, like a star anise\u2019s point in a throat: what if people didn\u2019t understand me. I imagined people like Thyme being so rare that they laughed. I imagined the people whose languages used gendered pronouns insisting that I choose male or female. I imagined every one of these one million people needing to be told that I was un-gendered, a different gender\u2014if I didn\u2019t even know what to call myself, how could I expect to be taken seriously?\u2014the way I had needed to tell everyone I knew in the asteroids when I was younger. I imagined giving up.\n I told myself to stop being foolish. How could one million people have only two fixed genders?\n But the only other person like me in all the asteroids was Aagot, who I couldn\u2019t find.\n Fields\n It was not quite the last time I would approach my family\u2019s asteroid: that pitted, dark peppercorn-shape, orbited by a moon only three kilometers in diameter, that landscape at the heart of my personal stories. Home. No, it was not quite the last time I would approach it, but I hurt enough to believe it was.\n \u201cBig Cousin!\u201d my youngest cousin\u2019s voice came in over the comm. \u201cWe\u2019re opening the smaller landing bay for you. Bring everyone in!\u201d\n A hole slowly opened in the asteroid\u2019s side.\n I wordlessly landed my craft, waited for the bay doors to close and the air to return, waited for the signal to unlock my craft\u2019s door. Unloading began. My family emerged from the corridors to help: to organize the storage of possessions, to lead people to places they could sleep and spend time until the Cai Nu people arrived.\n I slipped away to the fields.\n They filled four vast rooms: stacked shelves holding soil and spice-plants. I drifted above them, perpendicular to their ends, looking along each shelf at sage bushes, carefully stunted cinnamon trees, red-fruited chilies, long fennel stalks fronded with white flowers, clusters of bay and berry-heavy juniper and green-leafed plants hung with the star-seeds of anise. So many smells: green and sharp and sweet. Home-smells.\n Many plants had been recently harvested: leaves thinned out\u2014taken for drying\u2014and seeds picked. Others soon would be. Our last harvest.\n I went to a cluster of star anise plants.\n The light gravity generator in the shelf pulled me to the soil. Clods between my toes. Glossy leaves against my legs. The weight of my body startled me, pulled me to my knees. I steadied myself. It was always uncomfortable, returning to the fields after a long journey. Soon\u2014no. I sat. I placed an unripe seed\u2014green, eight-pointed\u2014on my tongue, I dug my fingers into the soil. My skin already smelled of the fields: green, earthy. Home.\n Would I ever work in a field on Cai Nu? Would I ever adjust to that much gravity?\n I wanted to think of nothing but star anise against my tongue, against my skin.\n Younger Mother\u2019s voice cut through the air. \u201cOldest Child? Is that you?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Boots clanged on metal: she climbed down from far above me, shelf to shelf, until she appeared at the end of mine and swung herself onto the soil with an ease I lacked. A bag of cinnamon hung from her shoulder. She walked towards me with bark-stained fingers and bare feet\u2014and the way she walked, straight-backed and sturdy, reminded me suddenly of the pictures of the Cai Nu people.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you working,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI was thinking about, well, a lot of things.\u201d She crouched at my side, smiling. \u201cWhy are you in here?\u201d\n \u201cI wanted to sit in the fields, as we\u2019ll be abandoning them soon.\u201d\n My voice was as brittle as a dried cardamom pod.\n Younger Mother\u2019s smile faded.\n I looked away, at the soil, at the star anise, as my mother quietly said, \u201cIt will be better. For everyone. Just\u2014just imagine the fields there! Real fields, laid flat across the ground not stacked like this, like shelves because we don\u2019t have to room to do it any other way\u2014and sunshine!\u201d\n \u201cI see the sun regularly,\u201d I murmured.\n Above our heads, the underside of the next shelf held UV lights that replicated the sun for the plants: a constellation of hundreds across the fields.\n \u201cI\u2019ve read about rain and snow in a thousand poems,\u201d Younger Mother said, \u201cbut to see them! To feel them on my skin!\u201d\n We\u2014I\u2014wouldn\u2019t. I had grown up in the fields, gravity on my bones, but I had spent so much of the past ten years among the asteroids. I loved it: the cumin or clove or galangal on my tongue, the spice cabinet doors sliding open, the happiness I brought, the stories shared. But I doubted my body was much healthier than those of the people I traded with.\n Would my field-working family adapt quickly? Would they work in real fields?\n \u201cAnd they will have new spices there,\u201d Younger Mother said, running her fingers over the star anise\u2019s leaves. \u201cNew flavors. New\u2014so much.\u201d\n New spices.\n \u201cIt will be better.\u201d\n \u201cAnd difficult,\u201d I said. \u201cNo one seems to want to talk about that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat else can we do? You know this, you see the other asteroids and everything that\u2019s broken and old in them.\u201d\n I remembered the star anise asteroid, broken open like a seed casing, all its contents\u2014its people, who I had once known\u2014spilled out.\n \u201cI need to get back to harvesting,\u201d Younger Mother said. \u201cI know there won\u2019t be much need for all this on Cai Nu, but it would be a shame for it to go to waste.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll eat it.\u201d\n She smiled, then left me among the star anise plants, their seeds hanging around me like the view from an asteroid\u2019s surface. I couldn\u2019t imagine any other view.\n I returned to my craft, to my journey\u2014not a trade journey, any more.\n Cinnamon, Turmeric, Rosemary, Cloves, Galangal, Sage\n I started to forget to place spices on my tongue as I arrived at each asteroid, collecting its people\u2014bringing them closer to the Cai Nu people\u2019s arrival. I started\u2014slowly, reluctantly\u2014to think of the ways life on Cai Nu would be better for them, for me.\n Found\n Everyone gathered. Everyone. Who had ever imagined such a sight? So many people holding onto the walls or drifting carefully, so many bags and boxes tethered with them, so many voices all at once\u2014people who had never seen each other, only spoken over the comms, suddenly able to talk unending, to shyly smile and embrace and unhesitatingly kiss. A wonder. A hundred people, another hundred, another. A community, not stretched out like sparse flowers on an ill chili plant but here, together, one. Everyone.\n I couldn\u2019t deny my excitement. I couldn\u2019t subdue my fear.\n I looked and looked for Aagot.\n Older Mother had set up comm units throughout the large loading bay, so that her voice could be heard everywhere in that vast space, among so many people. Periodically she said, \u201cThe Cai Nu craft is now two hours away!\u201d and, \u201cThe Cai Nu craft is continuing its steady course, only an hour away!\u201d until, suddenly, too soon, \u201cThe Cai Nu craft will enter the landing bay in ten minutes.\u201d I drifted through the loading bay. Around me, people drew in breath together, a long silence before new conversations streamed out like air into space.\n Then\u2014so soon\u2014we heard the grinding as the landing bay doors opened for the first time in over a hundred years. We heard nothing, nothing, noise lost in vacuum\u2014then a gentle set of metal-on-metal sounds. The Cai Nu craft landing. I drifted, unseeing. I only knew sounds. Arrival. The landing bay doors closing again. The first set of airlock doors between the two bays opening. I didn\u2019t breathe, I didn\u2019t speak\u2014no one did. I reached a wall. I held.\n The second set of airlock doors opened.\n The people\u2014five of them\u2014wore dark blue suits and helmets with clear visors, but I was too far away to see their faces. Into our silence they slowly entered, using the handrails that spread across the wall like roots. They removed their helmets. They looked at us with cautious smiles. One said in Mandarin, \u201cI am Team Leader Hu Leyi. It is a pleasure to finally be here and meeting you all.\u201d\n Older Mother drifted forward, saying, \u201cI am Lo Minyu. On behalf of everyone: welcome. You are very welcome here.\u201d\n The other four Cai Nu people looked around the loading bay, as if trying to match faces to the voices they had heard over the comms.\n \u201cAre you all here?\u201d Hu Leyi asked.\n What did they think of us? What did they\u2014\n I saw, then, a long, thin braid of hair with a circular metal ornament fixed to its end.\n I remembered: etched with a person crouched inside the shape of a bear.\n \u201cAagot!\u201d Then fear reached my tongue and I couldn\u2019t talk. Was this Aagot? Was this some other person, who did not know me, did not want to talk to me\u2014\n The person turned.\n \u201cAagot,\u201d I managed.\n A slight frown. \u201cEcralali, now.\u201d\n Now. A name-change\u2014a reason I hadn\u2019t been able to find Aagot Fossen, who no longer existed.\n \u201cDid we meet when I was younger?\u201d Ecralali asked.\n \u201cYes. Yes. I am Lo Yiying.\u201d\n Quietly, Ecralali said, \u201cI know you.\u201d\n \u201cYears ago, we talked about\u2014\u201d One or two people were interested in our conversation. I wanted privacy. I wanted no one to judge our words unimportant, irrelevant. Most of all, I wanted Ecralali to remember me. \u201cWe talked about Thyme and gender and\u2014\u201d I might as well have bared my skin in the space between the asteroids. \u201cIt was the most important conversation I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n Ecralali\u2019s face changed: astonishment and delight. Unless I interpreted wrongly, unless I imagined\u2014\n \u201cI remember,\u201d Ecralali said, \u201cI remember telling you about un-gendered Houyi\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d only ever known Houyi as a woman before then,\u201d I said, as full of wonder as if I was hearing the tale of Chang E and Houyi for the first time. \u201cThat\u2019s how my mothers always tell the story.\u201d\n \u201c\u2014and the story of the stars, whose lives are not measured in gender.\u201d\n \u201cThyme,\u201d I said, fennel-foliage soft, \u201cwho is like me.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Hu Leyi and her colleagues were still talking: moving among us, taking names, inventorying possessions, dividing us into groups.\n \u201cI know more stories now,\u201d Ecralali said.\n \u201cI\u2014I would like to hear them.\u201d\n \u201cI know about Cai Nu\u2014the founder, not the moon\u2014I\u2019ve read everything in our records, listened to every story. A lot of them tell that Cai Nu was fluidly gendered.\u201d\n \u201cThe founder was . . . \u201d\n Ecralali\u2019s smile was as rich as a whole cabinet of spices.\n I half-heard announcements. We would have a room for each family on the Cai Nu people\u2019s spacecraft, as well as several communal spaces, connected by a long corridor. I thought of stems. I thought of floating above the spices still growing on the shelves of my family\u2019s fields. They would shrivel and die and I would never again be Lo Yiying the spice trader. I would be far from my home. Then we would reach Cai Nu. Gleaming. Strange. Skied.\n Storied.\n \u201cI want to know what stories are told there,\u201d Ecralali said.\n \u201cI would listen to every one.\u201d\n It hadn\u2019t occurred to me\u2014\n I had needed to explain myself to my family, to people among the asteroids. Before that\u2014to myself. That had taken almost twenty years. I had only found myself in the stories that fell from Ecralali\u2019s\u2014once-Aagot\u2019s\u2014mouth like star anise. To even imagine that I might be found in other stories\u2014\n I hadn\u2019t.\n \u201cMy favorite stories,\u201d Ecralali said, \u201care those that say \u2018Cai Nu\u2019 is a chosen name.\u201d\n One of Hu Leyi\u2019s colleagues reached us. As Ecralali said, \u201cEcralali Fos,\u201d and pointed to just one small bag, I thought of my own name: a gift from my mothers. Could I\u2014No. I still wanted it. It had clung to me, all these years, like a grain of soil under a fingernail: a welcome reminder of my family on the long journeys between the asteroids. It fit me.\n Below us, the first group passed through the airlock doors to the spacecraft.\n \u201cLo Yiying,\u201d I said, and my voice was almost steady. \u201cMy possessions are with my family\u2014Lo Minyu and Xu Weina are my mothers.\u201d I didn\u2019t think I needed to list the rest of my family\u2014brother, cousins, aunts, uncles, a single grandfather. They all waited together, with the spice cabinet\u2014full of the final harvest\u2014between them.\n The man made a note on the translucent screen that hovered in front of him, then moved on.\n \u201cI should go to my family,\u201d I said, though I couldn\u2019t imagine moving, couldn\u2019t imagine any of what would happen next.\n \u201cWe have months of journeying ahead of us,\u201d Ecralali said. \u201cPlenty of time for telling stories.\u201d\n Thyme\n The fourth story Ecralali gave me, with thyme on our tongues, was of Cai Nu: working on a team of scientists identifying planets and moons suitable for human settlement, finding the moon that would eventually bear their name, spending decades preparing the team for the long journey and the tireless tasks at the other end\u2014then, being invited to join the team despite their advanced age.\n Cai Nu lived a year on the moon before finally dying. They are remembered forever: their vision of people living on this moon, their hard work making it more than a story.\n Their name, chosen in the same year that they first saw a promising moon in their data.\n I pressed the thyme to the roof of my mouth.\n I was not alone.\n Alex Dally MacFarlane lives in London, where she is pursuing an MA in Ancient History.

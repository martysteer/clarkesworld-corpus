Vessel: The Intention\n The man and his geezix stepped out of the burned hills in the pitch-black morning. Machines towered in front of them, caught in the lights of the floating handhelds, and Cal listened to the geezix make its way carefully over the pebbles of an ancient wash and tried not to love it.\n The files were all wrong. This was supposed to be a military outpost.\n \u201cDaddy,\u201d the geezix said quietly.\n Two lights floated in front of them, directing most of their shine outwards so as to not blind Cal or the geezix. There was a fence structure that stretched off in both directions. Large, rounded animals towered over it, weeping strips of rust from their eyes and ears.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not what we thought, is it, Daddy?\u201d The geezix said. Cal\u2019s chest tightened.\n \u201cI told you. Don\u2019t call me that.\u201d\n There was a moment of silence in which Cal could feel the geezix\u2019s sadness behind him like a swelling wound.\n \u201cNo,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWe thought it would be a military base.\u201d\n Cal gestured at the handhelds panning their lights slowly over the floating animals.\n \u201cWhat is it, Daddy?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Cal felt the geezix\u2019s hand upon his wrist and he realized he\u2019d stopped walking.\n \u201cSo do we get to leave?\u201d\n Cal looked down. The geezix\u2019s eyes were round and swollen with tears, and the flesh around the left one drooped a bit, revealing bone.\n \u201cNo. They sent us. We have to catalog it. Make the record right.\u201d\n It smiled.\n \u201cI want to help, Daddy.\u201d\n \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d He set down the sensor kit he was carrying and lifted the lid. The pod floated out, its muted lights glowing.\n \u201cFollow it that way, toward the tower. See it?\u201d\n Cal pointed out past the towering animals, at a distant shape in the darkness.\n \u201cOK,\u201d the geezix answered softly.\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy. Just follow the sensor pod. It will tell you if it needs help taking samples or anything.\u201d\n The geezix looked out at the darkness and the tower, a darker wound in the black.\n \u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d Cal said. \u201cThis place is abandoned.\u201d\n \u201cAb-dab-donned?\u201d\n \u201cEmpty. No one\u2019s here but us.\u201d Cal pointed. \u201cTo the tower. I\u2019ll find you in an hour.\u201d\n \u201cDaddy,\u201d the geezix said.\n Inwardly, Cal sighed. He knew what would work, but it hurt to say it.\n \u201cBe brave, honey.\u201d\n It looked up at him and smiled, revealing half a mouth of teeth, the rest a mush of blood clots and old food.\n \u201cOK, Daddy.\u201d\n The geezix walked off into the darkness.\n Cal activated his own sensor kit and followed it the opposite direction, through the gate, under an iron pig striped in rust at its bolts. Small empty structures stood under the animals, thick layers of dust on the windows reflecting the light from the handhelds right back at him. Past the gate a cobblestoned path split. The remnants of a large garden clung together at the split. Cal stopped and listened to the geezix\u2019s footsteps rasping quietly off into the darkness, and he slid a small flask from his hip pocket and drank from it until the warmth inside him matched that of the flask\u2019s metal.\n \u201cTell me more,\u201d Cal said to the sensor pod, which was hovering outside of the dead garden.\n \u201cHuman colony, seventh wave. First colony records list it as Amara Station. Population unlisted. Organizational structure unlisted. After the war began the designation was changed to a military installation. Most recent records denote research and a mech garrison.\u201d\n \u201cHuman still, or First Ones?\u201d\n \u201cHuman. Then First Ones.\u201d\n Meaning the machines had come through and scoured the colony.\n \u201cIf it belonged to the First Ones, shouldn\u2019t records still exist? You won the war, after all.\u201d\n The sensor pod paused.\n \u201cThe records pertaining to this system were destroyed in a raid on thought pool structures in a nearby meteor cloud.\u201d\n Cal smiled. It always made him feel good to remember times when the First Ones had lost something in the wars. You couldn\u2019t deny that the First Ones were superior. They\u2019d won the war. Their thought pools were so smart that it sometimes seemed like they could tell the future. As if to rub it in, they called themselves the First Ones, as they were as distinct from the life that had created them, humans, as humans were from primates. They were the first true intelligence.\n With arrogance like that, how could it be anything except nice to remember that they\u2019d suffered in the war too?\n \u201cLet\u2019s go, then,\u201d he said, and the sensor pod moved off into the darkness. It followed a contour in the ground, its dim lights revealing dead grass edging the cobblestones, and out in the darkness to the right were the edges of large cylinders, faded by time into a neutral plastic color.\n \u201cMachines that stimulate the nervous system by creating motion,\u201d the sensor pod said.\n \u201cRides,\u201d Cal said, wondering what such a thing would be doing on this empty rock. As he thought about it a strange anger at the sensor pod for assuming he wouldn\u2019t know what a roller coaster was arose in him. The memory was right on the edge of a darkness within his mind that he should know not to walk into, but still . . .\n \u201cValia,\u201d he said involuntarily. The sensor pod was smart enough not to answer.\n \u201cChildren loved rides,\u201d she had said. \u201cThere were whole parks full of them on old Earth.\u201d She had a been a historian when they met, and was enrolled in a university that, ever since the war ended a hundred years before, was led by a First One thought pool. The students were all given research assignments, but only the most oblivious among them could be happy with it; the simplest research component on any thought pool could out-reason the brightest student. It was, like so many things, a way for the First Ones to keep human beings busy.\n Cal had said as much about rides too, when she brought them up all those years ago.\n \u201cP\u2019shaw,\u201d Valia had responded gently. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that.\u201d\n He knew what she really was asking\u2014do you still want to have kids? Even though they\u2019ve placed us on a deep space research vessel, which isn\u2019t really so different than being a researcher in the service of a thought pool at a university, as thought pools from different jurisdictions sent these research vessels out to map colonies that had been lost during the war. For posterity, thought pools would say, which is an endeavor that humans and First Ones share.\n He\u2019d been young\u2014from this moment in time, with whiskey burning his throat, in the darkness, listening to the geezix laugh or call in the distance\u2014he\u2019d been so impossibly young. He\u2019d smiled at Valia when she asked about kids.\n \u201cOf course,\u201d he\u2019d said.\n She was pregnant when the ship launched, and Elena was born as they mapped their second colony. The ship\u2019s medbay with its computer assistants had done it all while Cal waited and watched the metallic arms and the bright circles of the surgical lights move over his wife.\n Cal dug the flask from his pocket and drank from it and almost ran into the sensor pod. It had stopped.\n \u201cSubstructures exist ahead,\u201d it said. \u201cThey run beneath us, as far as the adjacent trees.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cal asked.\n \u201cUnknown. The substructures do not appear on any description or remaining text that mentions the installation.\u201d\n \u201cMaintenance, gotta be,\u201d Cal said.\n \u201cIt is not,\u201d the pod answered. \u201cIt is of unknown purpose and must be explored.\u201d It paused. \u201cYour daughter is hiding nearby.\u201d\n \u201cWhere?\u201d\n The pod panned a light over the trees. In the hard phosphorescence they looked as if they were made of paper, as if even his eyes passing over them would leave small scratches. The geezix\u2019s face appeared in the light. It was smiling its swollen, lopsided smile. It laughed. The sound ringing through the dead trees unsettled Cal.\n \u201cShhh,\u201d he said.\n The geezix shook its head and walked toward him over the gentle slope.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t see me, Daddy.\u201d\n \u201cI told you to go all the way to the tower,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the pod I sent with you?\u201d The sensor pod floated out of the trees, its lights coming on.\n The geezix paused a few feet from him.\n \u201cThis is a place for kids, Daddy. You didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe it used to be. But our job today is to explore it and write a report.\u201d\n \u201cI saw what was called a roller coaster.\u201d\n Cal couldn\u2019t tell just what the geezix was about to say and had the odd fear that it would ask him in a completely neutral voice to ride the roller coaster with it. A broken, ancient roller coaster, a battered geezix that broke his heart every time he looked in its eyes, all in the dark. He spoke first.\n \u201cI found a substructure. I have to check it out.\u201d\n \u201cGoodie. I want to help.\u201d\n \u201cThree meters that way,\u201d the sensor pod said, its light shifting to indicate a path through the dead trees. Cal followed it and the geezix followed him.\n \u201cHow come there\u2019s nobody here?\u201d the geezix asked.\n \u201cThey all left in the war.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Cal shook his head. The sensor pod was hovering between two trees, bathing the patch of ground beneath it in amber light. Cal kneeled. The ground here was a fine dust that seemed to him to be more than a type of dirt, the final stage in some decomposition process. He swept it away, and the geezix leaned to help. As they swept they revealed a metallic panel beneath the dust, and Cal noticed that the geezix\u2019s fingers seemed looser in the flesh than they should be, as if its skin was ill fitting.\n \u201cThis is an access point to the substructure,\u201d the pod said.\n \u201cYay,\u201d the geezix said.\n \u201cNo, go sit by the tree, um\u2014honey.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s lonely.\u201d\n The sensor pod sank closer to the hatch, its utility arm extending. As its light got closer to the hatch it shrunk from the darkness around them, and the weight of the abandoned orchard seemed to grow. There was loud grinding and a pop, and then the hatch was up. An odor came out of it, foul, but nothing that Cal recognized.\n \u201cI mean it, honey, stay there.\u201d\n The geezix deflated, laying its head upon its knees, then looked up again, with her eyes coy and playful and sickening to Cal.\n \u201cStay there,\u201d Cal said one last time, and he lowered himself into the dark hallway. The pod had already moved to a corner of the hallway and it seemed to be weighing which way to go.\n \u201cThe substructure is sizeable and consists of at least three levels,\u201d it said.\n It went silent as it considered the data its sweeps were producing. It could read space only and would be looking for open areas, computer cores, access points.\n \u201cNo structural weak spots,\u201d the pod said. In an unexpected kind of levity, it continued. \u201cChoose a direction.\u201d\n Cal moved off left. His handheld light pushed the darkness back, keeping it a steady twenty feet from him, like a moving wall. He walked for ten minutes and finally found stairs.\n \u201cComputer core fifty meters from your present position.\u201d\n Ah good, Cal thought, wake up the computer, figure out what the substructure was for, and then back to the ship, and leave.\n He followed the pod\u2019s directions and in a minute his handheld lit up a cavernous room. Dead consoles covered the far wall in a concave stretch that made his neck hurt to look at it. A single empty chair sat in front of them and Cal settled into it and pulled the portable power plant out of a side pocket. It hummed and established a field. After a minute or so the screens blinked to life.\n Three Years Ago, on The Intention\n They tell you First Ones-constructed ships are big, but you really don\u2019t get it. After six months on The Intention, Cal still hadn\u2019t seen half of it. He\u2019d walked all of the engineering decks first, the command deck and the quarters, all of them empty except for theirs, and then below those, a deck that was filled with a vast forest.\n \u201cThey say it\u2019s good for us,\u201d Valia had said one day as they stood next to the river that ran through the forest. Well-placed lights shone through the trees so diffuse noontime hung around them like peach jam spread through the air.\n \u201cHuh?\u201d\n \u201cTo be outside,\u201d Valia said.\n Cal laughed.\n \u201cA forest in a spaceship.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re animals,\u201d Valia said, something in her voice like humor. \u201cWe need trees to sniff.\u201d\n Cal looked up and saw Elena looking out from behind a tree, just her eye and a fringe of her hair. He turned and looked toward the water.\n \u201cValia, this time I think she might really be gone,\u201d he said.\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Elena has this pony, see, that can ride through space.\u201d\n \u201cOh, of course.\u201d\n \u201cThis ship is boring, this forest is quiet . . . \u201d\n He heard Elena\u2019s foot on the grass just behind him, and then she leaped with a shrill roar and fell on his shoulders. Cal staggered up, screaming, fake-terrified, and finally laughing as she ran off into the trees again.\n Later, Cal had killed that forest. He dug into the oversight programs and burned anything that looked like it kept trees alive and water running. Still it took them a year to die; they hung on, quiet in the dark, full of will.\n A kindness, Valia had said. A kindness.\n Amara Station\n The computers were ancient, but once the field saturated enough of the control room the screens come to life. The room around them was early First Ones design\u2014the floors swaled in weird ways; a door to his left was a foot off the ground.\n Cal set the power plant aside and looked up at the sensor pod.\n \u201cWell? What are you getting?\u201d\n The sensor pod floated along the far wall, silent, panning its light.\n Cal thought of ways he might ridicule the sensor pod, but only out of the tired reflex of a lonely man. He\u2019d gone through a phase when he\u2019d screamed at the screens in the command center of the ship. He\u2019d killed the trees. He\u2019d tried to crash the ship. None of it had worked.\n \u201cThe structure is planned out in three chambers,\u201d the sensor pod finally said. \u201cDiagnostics are present for all of them. It is a medical facility.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Cal asked. He\u2019d always heard that First Ones unplugged old or sick members of their race, ground them up, and used them to make new technology. He walked on dead First Ones every time he walked down the hall. The table he ate breakfast at every day was ground up First Ones.\n \u201cMedical facility? Explain.\u201d\n The sensor pod said nothing.\n \u201cWell, we have enough to list it, right?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d the sensor pod answered.\n \u201cThat\u2019s it? No?\u201d\n It went quiet again, dragging its light over the walls.\n Cal got up close to the screens, but they were impossible to decipher. It was all the First Ones\u2019 language.\n \u201cTell me where these chambers are,\u201d he said.\n The Intention, Three Years Ago\n The trick was variety, and the spaceship knew it. Every morning there were lists of things to fix, and Cal fixed them, even though the comp drones could do it better. One day, a year or so after launch, the ship\u2019s computer had sent Cal out into the forest to look for what it called a gratuitous passenger. A stowaway? The sinking terror of a stranger being on the ship, unseen.\n Cal looked through the forest for two days, ready to kill. But he found nothing, nobody.\n Like so many things, it had just been to keep him busy.\n Like so many things, Cal had thought a few days after his daughter was born. Like everything.\n When Elena was seven they came out of light speed near an abandoned series of military installations. The Intention didn\u2019t really have shuttles. They were more like crewed artillery shells shot at a planet. Cal and Valia slid down a ladder into one and it sealed up behind them, leaving Elena to read books in her quarters. When they were strapped in it fired off and they roared down into the atmosphere. It landed in the mountains outside the colony. The walk out of the mountains was long, and neither of their hearts were in it, but finally they were crouched on a ridge looking down at the colony.\n It hadn\u2019t been badly damaged, and Cal\u2019s heart leaped when he saw a person walking down one of the streets.\n \u201cShit,\u201d Cal said. \u201cIt\u2019s still inhabited.\u201d\n Valia whistled, and Cal laughed.\n \u201cThis is us, honey. We make contact with a lost colony. The pools task us to be the experts on it until one of the expedition ships arrives. We go back to Earth and get teaching gigs at university.\u201d\n Valia turned to him and smiled. That smile\u2014so perfectly hers\u2014a mix of joy and exhaustion. Her eye socket leaped away from her face and she stared at him, still smiling, and then leaned forward and caught herself with her hands, and she puked, and fell flat, dead.\n Cal didn\u2019t know what he did next. He might remember being by the shuttle, holding Valia under the arms, but not looking at her face. Maybe a pistol roaring in his hand. Maybe dead colonists in the gulley where the shuttle had landed. He was sure he dragged Valia back into the shuttle. And back on The Intention he remembered very clearly holding Elena as the med bots worked on Valia, and she cried quietly, the brave girl, and he was proud and heartbroken, and only later he thought that he might\u2019ve covered her eyes or taken her away so she couldn\u2019t see the med bots moving around her mother, leaning close with their faces full of optics, irrigating a wound they knew they couldn\u2019t fix.\n Amara Station\n \u201cEarly First Ones were largely corporeal,\u201d the sensor pod said, and they moved down a ladder into the first chamber.\n \u201cThey would\u2019ve moved throughout this station via the tracks you see placed throughout.\u201d\n The ladder led down into a simple room. There were old, overstuffed chairs. A few plates left on the table. The food that had been on them had long since turned to powder.\n \u201cThis space was clearly not used by First Ones, which of course have no need for sustenance of this type,\u201d the sensor pod said.\n \u201cSo who?\u201d\n \u201cHumans, presumably,\u201d it answered.\n Stating the obvious, Cal thought, and knew that meant that the sensor pod was as lost as he was. It shined the light on a hatch in the middle of the floor as if politely suggesting that Cal go through it.\n He slipped his pistol free and gestured.\n \u201cI\u2019ll open, but you first.\u201d\n The hatch came up easily under Cal\u2019s hands and the sensor pod lowered into it, the blackness inside swallowing it up.\n After a long pause, the sensor pod spoke.\n \u201cBiological material is present.\u201d\n The Intention\n In Cal\u2019s mind, the months following Valia\u2019s death were clear and perfect and dark. It was as if he came into focus when he lost her, and even during just walking the narrow hallway of the ship it was impossible to lose himself, to forget for even a moment that she was gone. It\u2019s because of beginnings and ends, he\u2019d thought at the time: Anytime I start walking on this ship I\u2019m moving toward or away from Elena, my girl. Valia\u2019s girl too.\n Elena cried herself exhausted, and then worse than the tears, he caught her staring at him at weird times. As he was raising a fork to his mouth, maybe, and in that stare he could see that Elena knew he could fix it. He was her dad, and he should be able to bring her mother back.\n So he drank, and sent inquiries into the pools to see if he could come back to Earth, and received the refusals, and drank, and began to sleep in the forest.\n His darkest moment was standing in the trees, catching a sound on the false wind, and realizing that it was Elena, crying. And staying there, knowing that he couldn\u2019t face her.\n Then there was a day, two years after Valia\u2019s death, when he woke up and walked through the command center, got a cup of coffee, and topped it off with whiskey. He stood thinking. Or no; letting the cold rush of silence that had become his mind hiss through him. A thought floated through the silence: Elena would be hiding, waiting to scare him.\n He walked the halls, looking for her. She wasn\u2019t there and she wasn\u2019t in her room and finally she could only be in the forest. And yes she was, in the river, wedged into a knuckle of fake rocks, her forehead gently bruised where she\u2019d fallen. Drowned.\n Amara Station\n The biological material was survivors.\n They were thinly stretched between striated metallic frames.\n It took Cal a moment to understand what they were; at first he\u2019d have said that they were meat, and as his mind tried to make sense of it, he\u2019d say that they were some kind of bio scaffolding that the pools had used for something.\n As with Valia, her eye having leaped away from her face; as with Elena, knowing she was in the dark forest; as with waking alone on the ship every day since; as with the moment the geezix appeared, smiling, the perfect countenance of his daughter: there was an edging horror.\n They were people.\n \u201cHow,\u201d was all Cal could say.\n \u201cStasis fluids,\u201d the pod said. \u201cVery reliable and straightforward. They are grown in the above vats and leaked across the biological material to maintain it against degradation.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re alive?\u201d\n \u201cYes. It is unclear, however, how the stasis vats are powered. Likely a solar source, perhaps a satellite we did not detect, or a collection point on a moon.\u201d The sensor pod paused. \u201cThe separate power source indicates the importance of these biological specimens.\u201d\n Specimens. Three of them. It was like looking at stretched anatomical drawings. The feet disappeared into metallic clamps and the legs were peeled in all directions, stretched muscles, flesh flayed in open deltas. The guts were more complex, hanging in heavy arrangements and supported by discrete, sturdy frames. The arms were flayed like the legs, but the heads were masterpieces, opened in all directions, like flesh supernovae. They were all damp with the moisture trickling down across them from the vats above, the droplets making slow, predictable journeys across the bone and muscle, and finally disappearing into the foot manacles.\n They were looking at him.\n \u201cCongratulations,\u201d the sensor pod said. \u201cThis colony is inhabited.\u201d\n Later, Cal pulled himself out of the access hatch and into the still air. The sensor pod had stayed below, and Cal stood in the darkness above ground, waiting for his eyes to adjust. They didn\u2019t, and finally he felt the geezix\u2019s hand in his own, leading him away from the hatch, and helping him sit down on a stone.\n \u201cWhat did you find down there, Daddy?\u201d\n Cal listened to the trees shift above them.\n \u201cWill you tell me the truth about something?\u201d\n The geezix\u2019s head settled on his shoulder, a perfect approximation of how Elena used to do it.\n \u201cYour voice, Daddy. You\u2019re sad.\u201d\n \u201cJust tell me. If I kill you, you\u2019d come back, right?\u201d\n \u201cDaddy,\u201d it whispered.\n Sometimes, in the dark forest, Cal thought about the First Ones\u2019 sense of humor. The First Ones\u2019 thought pools were brilliant and could tell you things about why you loved a certain humble woman named Valia, and why it turned you on when she shook her head and smiled kindly and in response to your own joke she said so cute, so dumb, but when they tried to joke it always fell flat. There was something about humor, and also about comfort, that they did not understand, these both being emotional moments that reach from one person to another. Bridges, in a sense.\n Thus, the geezix.\n He could feel it watching him in the darkness.\n \u201cSo do we get to stay here?\u201d it asked.\n \u201cYou want to stay?\u201d\n \u201cI know you do.\u201d\n Do I? Cal thought. That old, sodden animal that had become his mind ran futures: Running the ship into the sun with him and the geezix on it\u2014wonderful, freeing. Burning the monstrosities below, putting them out of their misery\u2014right. Staying and studying the colony until a survey ship arrived\u2014procedure.\n \u201cYou must be hungry,\u201d Cal said.\n The geezix came to its feet.\n \u201cYes, Daddy. I am! Can we eat something?\u201d\n I\u2019ve never asked it that before, Cal thought. It doesn\u2019t need to eat.\n \u201cSure. Follow me.\u201d\n The geezix laughed and followed him.\n Cal walked out of the park, past the floating animals, and into the hills. The shuttle was on a flat plane, and inside it he flipped the overheads on, turning the dark world outside into a flat black sheet, with the geezix standing in it, smiling at him.\n \u201cI like han-gerbers.\u201d\n \u201cI know. This shuttle only has little things, though. Simple things.\u201d\n Cal collected a portable heating cell, and enough food for both of them, and carried it all back into the park, the geezix following, kicking rocks. They sat by the access hatch and Cal unfolded the heating element. It bathed them in light, and more slowly, warmth. He peeled the foil off of two meals and handed one to the geezix.\n \u201cThe right thing to do, honey, is burn them.\u201d\n The geezix looked a little concerned.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t it dangerous to burn things?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ve been suffering for a long, long time.\u201d\n \u201cThen let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n Its voice had exactly that determined quality that Elena\u2019s sometimes had. Cal looked up and saw it smiling and chewing, holding a hand to its cheek to keep the mashed potatoes from falling out of the hole in its face.\n \u201cBut you\u2019re right, anyway. We can\u2019t burn them.\u201d\n \u201cBut you said we should.\u201d\n Cal imagined the pod dashing back and forth in panic as he tried to light the monstrosities below on fire. He caught himself.\n \u201cNot monsters. They\u2019re people down there.\u201d\n The geezix nodded, trying to take another bite of food.\n The pod floated out of the hatch and settled into a slow orbit around them.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve completed full diagnostics on the systems?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d the pod answered.\n \u201cCan we move them?\u201d Cal asked.\n \u201cIt will be very difficult. There is risk to the patients.\u201d\n Risk? Have you seen them? And just imagine the descendant of the First Ones that did this to them in the first place saying with a straight face risk.\n \u201cHow much risk?\u201d\n \u201cAn acceptable level.\u201d\n \u201cAll right. Send the shuttle back up for the med bots. Bring them all and tell them to bring as many supplies as they can carry.\u201d\n The pod did not answer, which told Cal it was thinking about what he said.\n \u201cYou have a problem with that order?\u201d\n \u201cThe survivors are most valuable in situ.\u201d\n \u201cValuable?\u201d\n \u201cTheir arrangement. The historical importance of the devices.\u201d\n \u201cThey might have something important to say, right? They\u2019re not going to talk all strung up like that.\u201d\n The pod said nothing.\n \u201cI\u2019m getting them out of there. Try to stop me if you want to.\u201d\n Cal knew it was an empty rebellion on his part. The pod wouldn\u2019t have to stop him. It could just tell the med bots not to come down. He\u2019d be left here in the darkness, angry, staring at the geezix.\n But for some reason the pod didn\u2019t push the point.\n \u201cUnderstood. Remote launching shuttle now. Med bots will be on site within the hour.\u201d\n \u201cYay,\u201d the geezix said. It was watching something crawl across the ground.\n \u201cDid you find a bug?\u201d he said, then added, \u201choney.\u201d\n The geezix looked up at him, its eyes glowing.\n \u201cYes, Daddy. Have you ever seen one like this?\u201d\n Cal leaned over. The bug trundling between the geezix\u2019s feet was a round, heavy beetle.\n \u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen them before.\u201d\n \u201cIt looks like a button.\u201d\n \u201cYeah.\u201d\n The Intention\n The day the geezix had arrived, Cal had reached the end. That was how he thought of it, as if his life until now was a tunnel, and he\u2019d reached a dead end. Valia dead. Elena dead. And the worst part was knowing what kind of father he\u2019d been to his little girl since Valia died.\n Had it been a week since he\u2019d found Elena drowned? Maybe. Time had changed. It was pain now, and when he was awake he mostly just tried to stop it with booze. After a little while he wasn\u2019t even awake when he was awake. There was a fire smoldering inside his skull. He was dead bodies sewn together, a bunch of dead memories in a cold soup swirling around the fire in his head.\n He was in a hallway he didn\u2019t remember, deep in the ship, walking. The pistol was in his hand. A ship this size, once it arrived back at Earth\u2014how long would it take to find a body way down here? Would they ever?\n He sat down, leaned against the bulkhead, gritted his teeth, and lifted the pistol.\n \u201cDaddy?\u201d\n The voice was soft. Elena\u2019s, definitely. And there she was, ten feet down the hallway.\n Something wonderful washed over Cal. Peace, relief, forgiveness. It was like waking from a dream to realize that the world itself is not as cruel as your mind is.\n He stepped toward her, knelt, and took her in his arms.\n He knew right away. Maybe it was the smell of her; maybe it was the look in her eyes. He shoved her and ran away from the sound of her crying for him.\n Later, in the guts of the ship trying to avoid the geezix, Cal did his research from a computer terminal in the databases. It hadn\u2019t been touched in a year, given the fuzz of dust covering it. He learned that the First Ones sometimes re-tasked biological matter, too. It was the best substrate for something biological-looking. Valia and Elena had been melted down and turned into something that was meant to keep Cal going. A geezix was the slang. The official name was long.\n Cal avoided it for weeks. Which is to say he hid.\n But it kept coming, calling Daddy through the hallways, crying to be tucked in, crying that it was hungry, crying that it was scared. Lonely. Cold.\n Finally, he walked out of the depths of the ship and found his geezix.\n Amara Station\n It turned out to be even harder to rescue the colonists than the pod had thought. The stasis protocols were hardwired to exactly five outside power sources: A collection point on a moon, two satellites, a bank of batteries, and a terribly ingenious First Ones device that used the minute movements of the specimen\u2019 internal organs to power the stasis tech. If the moon failed, if the sun failed, if the batteries failed, still the tormented hearts of the specimens would keep the tormented hearts of the specimens alive.\n There were exactly five security protocols, too. The minute the med bots starting unscrewing panels, messages fired off to old First Ones military installations and dead comms centers. There\u2019d be no answer, of course, and the pod bored Cal with the info it was digging up in the archives. The military installations and defunct comms centers that the stasis protocols were contacting were part of an offshoot from one of the core First Ones\u2019 civilizations, the one that had left observable space after they won the war. Nobody really knew much about them, even the First Ones who had stayed to rule over humanity\u2019s old colonies and the home system.\n Each colonist was tied into so much that, as Cal watched the med bots work, it seemed that rather than removing the colonists from the station, they were taking the station apart. Where each colonist was, webbed across the odd stasis protocol frames, was at the top of large columns that stretched down into the structure. The med bots disassembled the ceiling and Cal hovered the shuttle over the open structure to slowly lift each column out. Only once they were removed and laid across the dead grass outside, now under massive phosphos that the med bots had brought down from the ship, did they dare try and separate them from the machinery.\n Cal sat in the darkness outside the range of the phosphos and watched as the med bots worked. The geezix sat next to him. It had the beetle and would lift it to eye level, drop it, and capture it again before it could get away.\n \u201cLet it go,\u201d he said, when he couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n The geezix mashed its palm onto the beetle. When it removed its hand only a wet spot was left where the beetle was. The geezix sniffed its palm.\n \u201cGet to the shuttle,\u201d Cal said. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n The Intention\n Three hours later Cal was in his bunk, thinking about drinking enough whiskey to go to sleep. Being asleep didn\u2019t sound any better than being awake, though, and he lay in his bunk waiting for the motivation to do one or the other.\n A pong sounded next to his bunk.\n \u201cThe inhabitants are aboard.\u201d\n \u201cIn medbay?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d the med bot answered.\n \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\n Something moved in the corner.\n \u201cAre we leaving, Daddy?\u201d\n Cal\u2019s gut fell, and he sat up quick, banging his head on the low ceiling above his bunk. He held his forehead and stared at the geezix as it stared back, smiling.\n \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d\n \u201cThe door.\u201d\n Cal went over the memory of coming back\u2014he\u2019d been tired, but he\u2019d seen the geezix walk off toward the forest. He\u2019d walked in the room alone.\n \u201cI came in by myself.\u201d\n The geezix stood up and walked to the wall. It opened a panel and there was a short, dark tunnel behind it. Cal had no idea it was there.\n \u201cSilly Daddy.\u201d\n Instead of answering, Cal washed his face and jogged the three decks up the medbay. He lost the geezix after just a few steps and it called out for him, but he kept jogging, until its voice was lost in the maze of ship\u2019s passages behind him.\n In the medbay, three beds were folded out from the walls. Each was covered with a sheet.\n \u201cWait. Are they alive?\u201d\n A med bot lowered from its place in the ceiling struts. It had three slowly rotating lamps for eyes. It didn\u2019t look at Cal, but instead at the bodies on the tables.\n \u201cOh yes. All three inhabitants survived. It was a complicated task, but made simpler by the quality of the original workmanship.\u201d\n Interesting moment to compliment your ancestors, Cal thought.\n \u201cTheir musculature was peeled off of their bones, but carefully, as to retain most of the nerve connections. It seemed important to the designers that they feel everything. There were also a great deal of aesthetic considerations in the work.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cThe peeled muscles were placed and trimmed in ways to produce symmetry in presentation.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cI cannot be sure. Given the concern over nerve connections, and symmetry, I\u2019d think of them as pieces of art.\u201d\n \u201cThey were people. Colonists. Prisoners of war.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, and excellent sources for historical data, I\u2019m sure. You must be very proud and excited to get to work. My own work was largely successful, although I fear they will not be the people that they once were.\u201d\n \u201cIf they\u2019re alive, why did you cover them in sheets?\u201d\n \u201cTheir wounds are unique. Steps were taken, but they still might be difficult for you to look at. And there is the matter of their skin. It was completely removed. I have replaced it with a self-replicating bio scaffold that, given enough time, should produce something much like their original skin.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s their mindset like?\u201d\n \u201cTwo of them are deeply dissociative. They will need a great deal of time to recover, if they ever do. The third seems responsive. I will medicate him in preparation for your discussion.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d\n \u201cHe is responsive, but has been in a terrible state for a long, long time. He may not talk to you.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s his choice.\u201d Cal paused. \u201cDid you put it together?\u201d\n The med bot looked at him.\n \u201cIt?\u201d\n \u201cThe geezix.\u201d\n It paused. It had not expected the question.\n \u201cYour daughter was shaped using the medbay technology, which includes the capabilities of units like this one.\u201d\n Forget it, Cal thought. You already knew all this.\n \u201cWake up the colonist. I want to talk to him.\u201d\n Beside the medbay was a small rec room. It was attached to the cafeteria by an automated tunnel system, and as Cal waited for the first colonist to come in, he ordered two coffees. But did they even have coffee on the colony? He thought about summoning the pod and asking it to comb the records, then decided not to.\n He heard a soft scuffing sound outside the door.\n The door slid open. The figure that came through wore loose scrubs, the same kind the geezix had worn when it first appeared. The scrubs were damp from the inside, blossoming here and there with moisture.\n The head was covered too, in a tailored paper mask. Cal could see the edges of exposed red flesh through the eyeholes. The mouth slit widened when the figure saw Cal.\n \u201cSit down. Are you hungry? Thirsty?\u201d\n The figure moved slowly to the chair and lowered itself.\n \u201cWater.\u201d\n Cal turned to the panel next to him.\n \u201cWater,\u201d he said. \u201cTwelve ounces. Room temperature.\u201d\n A moment later the panel opened and a glass of water was there. Cal placed it on the table.\n \u201cDo you need help?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d\n He shook his head.\n \u201cI asked the med bots to make sure there wasn\u2019t any pain.\u201d\n The colonist stared at the deck beneath his feet, then finally up at Cal.\n \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re on a ship called The Intention. It\u2019s a long-range exploration vessel. Our mission right now is to rediscover and catalog installations that were lost in the wars, or forgotten about after.\u201d\n \u201cWars.\u201d\n \u201cOur best information is that you were on a military outpost. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n The man blinked slowly.\n \u201cI\u2019m Jonathon.\u201d\n \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Cal said.\n Jonathon looked at the glass of water and then at his hands.\n \u201cWhat is happening?\u201d he asked again.\n \u201cYou\u2019re on my ship. We discovered your outpost and we stopped to see if there were still people here.\u201d\n \u201cSo we won the wars?\u201d Jonathon asked.\n What can I say to this? No. We didn\u2019t win. That might terrify Jonathon.\n \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d\n Jonathon was still looking at his hands.\n \u201cWhat did they do to me?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n I\u2019m not trained for this, Cal thought. Valia would be so much better at this. He could imagine just turning her loose on Jonathon\u2014help him, he\u2019d say, and then accept that he himself wouldn\u2019t know how to. He\u2019d disappear into the vastness of the ship.\n \u201cWhat am I wearing?\u201d\n \u201cYou can walk, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cCome with me,\u201d Cal said.\n The dead forest stretched out into the darkness. On the bank, Cal helped Jonathon lower himself onto the dry grass, and then sat next to him.\n \u201cStill no pain?\u201d\n \u201cStop asking.\u201d\n \u201cSorry. I haven\u2019t talked to another person in two years. I probably wasn\u2019t great at it even back then.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re alone? Out here?\u201d the man said. \u201cWhere is everyone else?\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d\n \u201cLights in the sky. And there was this roaring. It was. We . . . \u201d\n A kind of deep sadness settled into the man, and he settled back onto the grass.\n \u201cI\u2019ll just be honest,\u201d Cal began. \u201cI found your outpost a week ago. Records say it was a military base, but I think the First Ones took it over. It\u2019s not a military base anymore.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s been made to look like an ancient Earth amusement park.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a place that people took children. There were rides, they called them\u2014big metallic structures\u2014and they accelerated the riders, and had loops, drops, that kind of thing. They were exciting.\u201d\n The man reached slowly for the water and lifted it to his lips. He took a small sip and moaned.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thirsty for so long.\u201d\n \u201cCan you confirm that your outpost was a military base?\u201d\n \u201cConfirm?\u201d\n There was something in the way the man said it that Cal recognized. He was trying to lie.\n \u201cLook, we lost the war to the First Ones a hundred years ago. Any secrets you swore to keep don\u2019t mean anything to anyone but me.\u201d\n He sipped again.\n \u201cWe housed a mech wing.\u201d\n Something moved in the dark trees. The man reflexively lowered his hand to the grass, as if looking for something.\n \u201cAm I on a ship?\u201d\n \u201cYes. An exploration vessel.\u201d\n \u201cWith just you on it?\u201d\n \u201cThere used to be three of us. My wife and my daughter.\u201d\n Something flashed in the trees; it was the geezix\u2019s eyes.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s out there?\u201d\n \u201cPeople call it a geezix. It\u2019s made of biological material. Made to look like my daughter.\u201d\n \u201cMade? Is it a bot?\u201d\n \u201cLike one. A bot made of flesh.\u201d\n The geezix stepped slowly out from behind the tree.\n \u201cDaddy? Is this one of the people we found?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cCan I talk to him?\u201d\n \u201cLater, honey.\u201d\n \u201cBut I\u2019m bored.\u201d\n \u201cGo out into the forest. Find something interesting.\u201d\n The geezix smiled.\n \u201cOK. I will.\u201d\n It turned and walked into the darkness.\n \u201cHer name was Elena,\u201d Cal said. \u201cShe drowned two years ago. Just after, they sent the geezix.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cThe First Ones think we need things to keep us busy.\u201d\n \u201cOr we\u2019ll fight again,\u201d the man said, with a certain satisfaction.\n \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re scared of that. We\u2019re zoo animals to them. The ship, the tasks, the geezix. They know I loved Valia, my wife, but they also know that I loved Elena so much that without her I wouldn\u2019t make it. So they gave her back, in their way.\u201d\n The man raised the water to his lips and sipped.\n \u201cHow long will it stay out there?\u201d\n Cal shrugged.\n \u201cIt\u2019s probably watching us.\u201d\n A long moment of silence passed, and Cal focused on the darkness, trying to see the flash of the geezix\u2019s dull eyes. The motion of the branches and leaves occasionally fooled him\u2014a slight, almost invisible twitch, and he\u2019d think here, it\u2019s coming back. But then nothing would emerge from the darkness and he\u2019d realize it was just the trees slowly rotting.\n \u201cWhat did you call it? An amusement park?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cWhy did they turn our base into an amusement park?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. If I had to guess, it\u2019s like a museum. A way for the First Ones to learn about humans.\u201d\n The man lowered the cup and his hand went again to something that he was used to being at his side. A gun, Cal imagined.\n \u201cDon\u2019t lie this time. What did they do to us?\u201d\n I can\u2019t do this, Cal thought. Valia would be better. All I can do is give him the truth.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. The bots won\u2019t say. But I think the First Ones turned you into rides.\u201d\n \u201cLike the machines?\u201d\n The First Ones would slide themselves into the nervous systems of those people and ride their nerves, flash through their brains, thrill at their sensations. They\u2019d become their sensations. And the park above was a museum piece. An antechamber to the real rides.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure either. But you\u2019re free now, Jonathon. They\u2019re gone and you\u2019re free.\u201d\n The man\u2019s energy didn\u2019t last long. After sitting on the dead grass and looking out into the dark forest for a few more minutes, he asked to go somewhere he could sleep. Cal helped him stand and they went back up to the medbay. The bot was waiting at the door, hunched over, its eyes slowly rotating. It was motherly in a way that made Cal\u2019s palms itch.\n With the man resting in his cot, Cal went to the databases a deck up. It was a huge room of data cores stretching the whole mile-height of the ship. Most of it was inaccessible to Cal, but there was a single table set aside.\n He sat down at the table and a screen emerged.\n The colony was easy to find. The last records were as the pod had reported\u2014a human military establishment, likely a launching pad for a division of mechs. Ten years before the end of the war it fell behind the advancing First Ones\u2019 lines, and ten years after that, the war ended.\n The last detail in the database said no survivors. As Cal watched it the writing changed. Three survivors, it said. Cal was listed as the planetary authority, and The Intention was listed as a research platform, not an exploratory vessel.\n I have to change that, he thought. I have to get these people back to Earth. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ll want to stay near Amara.\n Cal stood and stretched. He needed sleep too, but of course he could not go back to his quarters, knowing now that the geezix had a secret way in. How many times had it snuck in and watched him sleep, or listened as he suffered through nightmares, trying to capture words to use on him, trying, with its little part-robot, part-corpse soul to figure him out?\n Cal walked into the databases and lay down next to one. It was warm, and after a moment his thoughts fell away, and he went to sleep.\n The next time he saw Jonathon he was not wearing the paper mask. A shiny, tender skin had formed over the material that the med bot had placed over him, and he was sitting in the rec room adjacent to the medbay, a plate of food in front of him.\n \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d\n Jonathon shrugged.\n \u201cSit. I\u2019m trying to guess what that bot made.\u201d\n Cal sat down and placed his own tray in front of him. He had slept for a very long time, and was hungry, but something told him to wait for Jonathon to start.\n \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be mung bean cake.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d\n \u201cWell then, you won\u2019t be disappointed. It\u2019s nothing like what it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n Jonathon pawed the table for his fork, found it with his somewhat weak, numb hands, and slowly lifted it. He cut a corner off of the mung bean cake and took a bite. Cal chopped his in half and ate it quickly.\n \u201cYou like it?\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d Jonathon answered.\n \u201cThey make other things. Don\u2019t order any meat, though. It never tastes right.\u201d\n Jonathon placed his fork on the table and leaned back in his chair. He looked exhausted already, although he must\u2019ve just woken up. Cal wondered how close he looked to how he had in life. Although his skin was a little shinier than Cal had seen on another adult, Jonathon was handsome.\n \u201cYou know what whiskey is?\u201d\n \u201cYou kidding? You got any?\u201d\n Cal pulled his flask from his pocket and slid it over to Jonathon. The man slowly lifted it to his lips, sipped, and sighed heavily.\n \u201cWho are the other survivors?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cal said. \u201cWe can try to wake them up soon. Maybe you know them.\u201d\n Jonathon sipped again.\n \u201cOf course I know them. There were only two hundred people on the base. Half of them flew mech swarms. The rest of us ran the base.\u201d\n Us\u2014that meant that Jonathon wasn\u2019t a pilot. Cal would\u2019ve guessed he was a commander of some kind. Maybe of the whole base. Records in the databases had indicated that the mech wing was a naval unit. Cal struggled to remember old naval ranks.\n \u201cYou\u2019d be an admiral, then.\u201d\n Jonathon laughed, coughed, and laughed again.\n \u201cI programmed the mess bots.\u201d He smiled painfully. \u201cI was the cook.\u201d\n Cal laughed too and gestured for the flask.\n \u201cMaybe you can help with ours.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did you mean, earlier, when you said they made us into rides?\u201d\n Shit, Cal thought. He realized that he was hoping that Jonathon would drink some of the whiskey, would begin to talk about life in the colony, maybe tell stories about what it\u2019s like to control a flock of robo-cooks on a base where everyone else flies a wing of combat mechs. Cal had been hoping he wouldn\u2019t want to talk about where he\u2019d been found, and how.\n \u201cLike I said, it\u2019s a guess. This outpost was overrun ten years before the wars ended. The First Ones travel in discrete communities, like cities, but huge. Swarms of cities. The one that took your outpost disappeared after the wars, so we don\u2019t know much about them. That\u2019s probably why they sent me out here, to see if we could learn anything about the vanished cousins.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d Jonathon said, taking the flask back. \u201cPilots used to say when you pick them up on the sensors it\u2019s like you\u2019re looking at a wall of ships that goes forever in all three dimensions.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. But like I said, we don\u2019t know much about the ones that took Amara Station. We know that some of the First Ones were not corporeal. They were more like bursts of electricity. Like, I don\u2019t know, thoughts. Given how they left you in there\u2014nerves intact, conscious, kept alive\u2014I\u2019m thinking that they tried to turn you into a roller coaster. Maybe so they could understand amusement parks.\u201d\n Jonathon took the flask back and sipped.\n \u201cRide?\u201d\n \u201cThey rode your nerves. Your ganglia. Your memories.\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Jonathon breathed, trying to grasp what Cal was saying.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. To understand you, maybe. Do you remember anything about the wars?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. We were killing them. The same pilots that told me about the First Ones\u2019 swarms told me that a good mech pilot could filet them like a fish.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe they were scared of you.\u201d\n \u201cDoes that explain what they did to us?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n But maybe it did. Cal had read about ancient wars in which fierce enemies were hung from walls, or turned into myths, or eaten.\n \u201cIf you were killing them, how did they take Amara Station?\u201d\n Jonathon sat quietly for a second.\n \u201cI remember now. A distress call. They sent the mech wing out to investigate. They knew it was a risk. They were saying it when they were leaving. The First Ones must\u2019ve hit us when all the mechs were out.\u201d\n Jonathon raised the flask again then set it on the table, empty.\n \u201cImpressive.\u201d\n \u201cGotta be to win drinking contests with mech pilots.\u201d\n Cal wanted to ask Jonathon what he remembered about after the First Ones took the station. He\u2019d been turned into something terrible, but the First Ones had clearly cherished him, in a way. It was hard to imagine how to begin that question, though. But of course Jonathon would be asked eventually\u2014either by the pods, or the med bots, or by the First Ones and human hangers-on that would come to study Amara Station.\n \u201cWhat was it like?\u201d\n Jonathon stared for a long moment.\n \u201cDark. I thought I was dead. And then I drifted. Sometimes I was there just enough to realize that I had died and that I was wrong about everything. Hell was real. It is dark and it hurts. But then I drifted again. Everything that came before seemed like a dream.\u201d\n Jonathon stared at his feet.\n \u201cYou\u2019re safe now,\u201d Cal said. \u201cAs soon as they let me, I\u2019m taking this ship back to Earth. I\u2019m taking you home.\u201d\n Jonathon raised his head.\n \u201cI am home, Cal. My home is Amara Station. I\u2019m an officer there, not on Earth.\u201d\n \u201cYou were an officer,\u201d Cal said, then caught himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n The other man sighed and slowly raised himself to his feet.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right. But you\u2019re wrong too. The army I was in got killed off. I was captured. I was tortured.\u201d\n Jonathon looked down at him, and there was something in his eyes that seemed very unlike a cook\u2019s. My eyes used to look like that, Cal thought. Those are the eyes that Valia would\u2019ve fallen in love with. I lost those eyes in the forest, in the geezix, in the emptiness and silence of the ship.\n \u201cBut they\u2019re gone. And I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n Jonathon walked slowly into the adjoining medbay. Before he went inside he looked over his shoulder.\n \u201cI want to go to Amara Station tomorrow.\u201d\n That night Cal lay down by the computer cores again. It was warm, almost like sleeping next to a living thing, and it felt private. He\u2019d never seen the geezix here. Perhaps it could not find him in the databases.\n But he couldn\u2019t sleep. His mind was sharp and running, flicking back and forth between the past and the present, all the while mourning what he was now. A man stuck in a ship, rotting away in orbit around maybe the sickest place he\u2019d ever seen.\n And Jonathon wants to go back down there?\n I\u2019m sober, he realized. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t stop thinking.\n Without whiskey numbing him to it, Cal could see that his thoughts were a separate living thing inside him. They roared on and on in the dark, dead forest decks above him, and he knew that when he finally did fall asleep, they\u2019d still be up there, haunting the dead trees.\n Cal sighed and stared up into the darkness. He tried to let it fill him, to let it pour into the dead forest behind his eyes, to blind him to it.\n You love forests so much because you are basically a forest, Valia had said once.\n Wait, not once. It was their first date.\n Cal could remember thinking a long time about where to take Valia. She was smarter than him, and beautiful, and had a way of looking at him that felt like she could see everything in his future, and it made her laugh a little. He\u2019d chosen to take her on a hike after considering everything else, knowing that she\u2019d either hate walking through a forest together\u2014or, he hoped, love it. She did, and as they trudged up the trail she talked about work, her passion for lexicography (\u201cWords\u2019 secrets,\u201d she\u2019d said, although he still didn\u2019t exactly understand what it was), and her favorite books.\n At the summit of the mountain she\u2019d asked him why he decided to take her hiking.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. I love forests. I thought you might too.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you love about them?\u201d\n \u201cThe trees, and the way the light falls through them . . . \u201d Cal struggled to put words to it. \u201cAnd the leaves. A thousand little blades of light.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I get it. You love forests so much because you are basically a forest.\u201d\n Cal hadn\u2019t understood what she meant, but she had that future-look, so he didn\u2019t ask questions.\n \u201cDaddy,\u201d a soft voice said.\n Cal could see it standing in the darkness, its hands crossed shyly.\n \u201cThere\u2019s doors everywhere,\u201d it said. And then almost apologetically: \u201cI know them all.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s OK, honey.\u201d\n Cal propped himself up on an elbow.\n \u201cGo back into the forest. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. We\u2019ll go down to the planet.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n The geezix stood there, looking at him.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no one anywhere on this ship, except the sick people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . There\u2019s no one except us.\u201d\n \u201cCome here,\u201d Cal said.\n The geezix walked to him and lay down. In the darkness he could see something. In his daughter he would\u2019ve called mischief.\n \u201cWhat did the daddy tree say to the baby tree?\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cLeaf me alone.\u201d\n It laughed, holding both hands over its mouth, as if it was embarrassed.\n \u201cGo to sleep, honey,\u201d Cal said, and settled in next to it.\n When Cal woke up, the geezix was gone. He walked to his quarters, took a shower, and made coffee. Taking his first sip, turning around in the small cabin, he saw the geezix standing on his bed.\n \u201cDaddy, one of the sick people is waiting by the shuttles.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s already down there?\u201d\n It nodded.\n \u201cHe talked to me. His name is Jon.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n \u201cThat he knew how to make pancakes, and if I knew what they were.\u201d\n \u201cDo you?\u201d\n \u201cShoes, right Daddy?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, shoes.\u201d\n Cal blew on his coffee, gulped it down, and found his pistol.\n \u201cYou\u2019re coming to the planet, right?\u201d\n The geezix angled its head and affected a silly voice.\n \u201cI planned-it.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cPlanet. Planned-it.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you joking so much?\u201d\n \u201c\u2019Cuz you like it.\u201d\n Cal walked to the shuttle bay, and the geezix followed. It sang songs as they walked, which Cal couldn\u2019t remember it doing before. Maybe talking to Jonathon had inspired it somehow; maybe it has been bored all this time. Maybe it hates being on this ship as much as I do.\n In the shuttle bay, Jonathon was standing next to the shuttle that they had used the most. It was striped with scorch marks from going through the atmosphere, and Jonathon stood there, running his finger along the border of one of them.\n \u201cGood morning, Jonathon.\u201d\n He turned. His skin had taken hold and looked almost entirely natural. He was a young-looking, rugged man.\n \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n \u201cAre you? You\u2019ve eaten?\u201d\n \u201cWhat am I, your patient?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. You\u2019re my patient.\u201d\n \u201cNo I\u2019m not. I belonged to that annoying med bot.\u201d\n The way he said it got Cal\u2019s attention.\n \u201cWhat about the med bot?\u201d\n Jonathon returned his attention to the scorch marks. Finally, he answered: \u201cI put it to sleep.\u201d\n \u201cWell, who is taking care of you three?\u201d\n \u201cNo one. Who\u2019s taking care of you?\u201d\n Cal shook his head and cued the shuttle door open. The geezix, who had been hanging back behind him, rushed past into the shuttle, and Jonathon followed it. Cal followed. Inside, the computers had raised stacked displays of numbers and trajectories. Amara Station hovered in the middle of the space, spinning slowly, a small throbbing icon where the actual station was. As the door closed the shuttle sank into the launch bay.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll want to sit back in that seat,\u201d Cal said. The geezix had already arranged itself in its own seat and was kicking its feet back and forth in excitement.\n Jonathon settled himself back, and so did Cal. When the countdown finished, the displays around them dimmed, and the shuttle leaped out of the ship, thrusting to the planet below. Cal felt himself mercilessly pressed into his seat.\n It left the ship, and after the initial burn, rolled over. The overhead panel peeled back and they could see the planet below as the shuttle passed onto the permanent nightside of the planet.\n The shuttle slowed and descended toward Amara Station, the graphic of the planet turning also, to indicate their progress.\n Finally they set down in the hills. When the doors opened the geezix leaped out of its seat and ran out into the darkness.\n \u201cShe\u2019s been on that ship a long time,\u201d Jonathon said. Cal didn\u2019t know quite how to answer, so he followed the geezix, pulling his pistol belt straight.\n They walked over the same ancient wash of pebbles that they had when they arrived, the geezix kicking at them just as it had before.\n The lights that the bots had erected over the structures illuminated them, an island of light on the dark planet: the large metallic animals hung there, staring down at them as they approached.\n \u201cWhat in the fuck,\u201d Jonathon said.\n \u201cThose weren\u2019t there when this was a mech station?\u201d\n \u201cIt was all underground. Invisible from here.\u201d\n Jonathon looked at the geezix and smiled.\n \u201cI used to hike out here sometimes. There were wild lupas.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d the geezix said.\n \u201cDogs.\u201d\n It kept staring.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a dog is?\u201d\n The geezix shook its head and Jonathon crouched, as a dog about to run would.\n \u201cLupas have this beautiful fur, and long legs, and you can feel them watching you. If you get close enough you can see their eyes look like your mom\u2019s.\u201d\n Whether Jonathon had meant it as a joke or hyperbole, the word mom froze the geezix.\n \u201cThey do?\u201d\n \u201cOh yes. And they talk. Not much, just a couple words, but when you get close, hey, they say. Hey good man. You have food, good man?\u201d\n \u201cHow\u2019d they learn to talk?\u201d\n \u201cThey just listened.\u201d\n The geezix stared out into the darkness.\n \u201cThose lupas died a hundred years ago,\u201d Cal said. \u201cThe First Ones attacked this place. They scorch planets. Nothing on the surface lives.\u201d\n Cal walked ahead and under the large metal animals into the pathways below. The landscape was stripped open and illuminated by the bots that had removed the three colonists. Cal stood on the edge of the pit. One of the bots was still working on the old computer cores down below, releasing the occasional flash of phosphor torchlight.\n \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d the geezix said.\n \u201cThere\u2019s food over by that tower.\u201d He pointed out in the darkness.\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n The geezix walked off into the dark slowly.\n \u201cWhy\u2019d you lie to her?\u201d Jonathon asked, suddenly standing closer.\n \u201cHer? It doesn\u2019t need to eat, Jonathon. It just says things like that so I feel closer to it.\u201d\n Jonathon was quiet, so Cal continued.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not a kid, Jon. It\u2019s a robot. A corpse.\u201d Jonathon was still quiet, so Cal tried to say it more nicely. \u201cShe\u2019s a made thing, Jon.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. But she is what she thinks she is, too. Like me and you and everybody else.\u201d\n Jonathon held his gaze for a moment, and then followed the geezix out into the darkness.\n Cal spent the rest of the afternoon watching the bots in the pit excavate the old base. A couple hours after they parted company, Jon returned with the geezix, carrying armfuls of vines and an odd, dark fruit. They dropped them a few feet from the edge of the pit.\n \u201cAmaran water plums,\u201d Jon said. \u201cCome try. I used to gather them. We had a bot that could make a crumble out of these that would make you cry.\u201d\n \u201cCry?\u201d the geezix said.\n \u201cBecause it was so good.\u201d\n Jon looked at Cal, and Cal realized he must\u2019ve had an odd look on his face.\n \u201cSee?\u201d said Jon. \u201cThey scoured it, but not everything died. Takes more than fire to kill these water plums.\u201d\n The plums were sweet but hard as tensed muscle. The geezix ate five of them, smiling as the juice dribbled down its chin. Cal ate two. Jon juggled with the plums that were left, and the geezix screamed in joy.\n Back on The Intention, Cal went to the databases and lay down next to the warm computer core. His mind was still racing\u2014from the dead forest above to lupas calling Jon a good man to the First Ones scouring a planet then saving three people to worship in their odd way. It was all so terrible.\n Cal sat awake until he realized that he was waiting for the geezix. It did not come, and somehow the darkness in the databases made him less tired, so finally he left the databases and walked up to the medbay. It was empty, and the three med bots were standing in the corners, powered down.\n He found Jon, the other two patients, and the geezix next door eating mung bean cake.\n Jon greeted him as if he\u2019d just entered his restaurant.\n \u201cHey, Cal. Have a seat. This is Dr. Yuro Weirnan, Chief Medical Officer of the station, and Alex Pietro. Mung bean cake?\u201d A little quieter: \u201cAnd you have any whiskey? The doc and I could use it.\u201d\n Cal sat across from Alex, a small boy, dressed in the same damp scrubs that Jon had been in, down to the tailored mask, and a woman with large eyes. She stared at him, absently running her hand over her smooth head.\n \u201cThis is my daddy,\u201d the geezix said.\n \u201cCall me Cal. I\u2019m the human element of the crew.\u201d He thought about how to tell them what they needed to know. \u201cHave you already talked to Jon?\u201d he asked finally, taking his flask out and passing it to the doctor first.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n The doctor sipped the whiskey and struggled to find words.\n \u201cThank you for freeing us.\u201d\n Cal shrugged. He wasn\u2019t sure what he could say to express the fact that he hadn\u2019t come looking for them, or even chosen to be here. If it was up to me, I\u2019d have gotten back into the ship and left and never have found you, Cal thought.\n The doctor shuddered and sipped the whiskey again.\n \u201cMy daddy is the captain of this ship,\u201d the geezix said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on it for a thousand years.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a bot, right?\u201d the doctor said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cLooks biological. I\u2019ve never seen one like it.\u201d\n The boy shifted in his chair and put his head down on his arms. The doctor leaned forward.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to take him back to bed. But I want a tour of the ship.\u201d\n Cal nodded. \u201cSure. You can go anywhere.\u201d\n \u201cJon says it\u2019s big.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI want you to give me a tour.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d\n Cal accepted the flask from her, and she led the boy from the room. Jon and the geezix started playing some kind of guessing game. The geezix laughed each time it got something right, and after a few moments Cal got lost watching it leaning forward, smiling, its hands on its knees. Self-consciously it touched its cheek where the flesh gaped and wiped away a bit of spittle. For just a bare second it seemed like a real child.\n Cal stood up, fetched a cup, and poured a finger of whiskey into it.\n \u201cHere, Jon. You need anything else?\u201d\n The man looked up, startled.\n \u201cNo, nothing.\u201d\n \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\n \u201cBye, Daddy,\u201d the geezix said, smiling hugely at him.\n \u201cBye, honey.\u201d\n Cal met the doctor outside the medbay. She didn\u2019t seem to have any destination in mind, and didn\u2019t seem to want to talk much, so Cal took her through the hangars first. There were ten, and all but one were empty. Similarly, there were ten decks of quarters, all empty, and Cal took her through each. After they\u2019d walked for twenty minutes she stopped for a second and placed her hand on the wall.\n \u201cI have to sit, Cal. That whiskey. I\u2019m light-headed.\u201d\n He led her to the bottom of the ship. There was an old view portal, a room with a translucent floor looking out on the featureless world of Amara. Cal helped the doctor sit on the one bench in the room, which was rounded so two observers could look down at the planet while sitting across from each other.\n \u201cIt didn\u2019t used to look like that,\u201d the doctor finally said. \u201cIt was green. There were so many forests on Amara there was a base rule that you couldn\u2019t leave the base alone. You might get lost.\u201d\n \u201cJon said he used to go walking.\u201d\n She smiled weakly.\n \u201cEveryone loved him. He did anything he wanted. And he\u2019d always bring back those water plums.\u201d She paused for a moment, and her smile drew back into her face. \u201cMilena would go with him.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cHis daughter.\u201d\n Of course he had a daughter, Cal thought.\n \u201cI can get you off of this ship, I think. The thought pools will probably let you go back to Earth.\u201d The doctor stared at the world below her. \u201cI offered Jon the same. He wants to stay.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s Earth like now?\u201d\n \u201cCrowded.\u201d\n \u201cWell, compared to this . . . \u201d\n Cal smiled.\n \u201cYeah. Compared to this, the only place that isn\u2019t crowded is Amara.\u201d\n The doctor let another quiet moment pass.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, Cal. I don\u2019t have anything back on Earth. Even back then, a hundred years ago . . . \u201d she breathed those words out as if they engendered vertigo. \u201cEven then I was raised on an orbital station. I never felt at home on Earth. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do there. I suppose I\u2019ll stay here and work with Jon.\u201d\n \u201cWork with him?\u201d\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t know? He told me first thing this morning. There\u2019s an amusement park down on the planet. The First Ones built it. He\u2019s going to rebuild it. Make it beautiful. Maybe people will come.\u201d\n \u201cBut why?\u201d\n She raised her eyes to his.\n \u201cAfter what\u2019s happened, and where we are, what do we really have?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d\n Cal nodded and offered the doctor the whiskey again. She took it gratefully.\n That night the geezix found him in the databases. It talked to him about what it had done that day\u2014seeing the planet, picking the plums, walking all over the ship with Jon and the boy, Alex.\n \u201cHe feels better, Daddy. You should see. I think they\u2019re forgetting what happened to them.\u201d\n \u201cI hope so.\u201d\n \u201cDid you know Jon had a little girl?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cShe died.\u201d\n \u201cYes, I know.\u201d\n \u201cAre you going to help with the roller coasters? Jon is going to make them work again. He\u2019s going to bury the old base. He\u2019s going to bring plants down and raise them and let them spread. He says that maybe in a long long time the lupas will come back.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, honey.\u201d\n The geezix\u2019s smile faltered, and it shook its head, knowing it had to agree with Cal.\n \u201cYes, Daddy. Yes. It\u2019s a stupid thing to think.\u201d\n It stopped talking then, and they both sat in the dark stillness of the databases. He felt the geezix breathing next to him and thought, why not help rebuild the park? What have I done for years now except hide in hallways? I don\u2019t want to go back to Earth either. I want to stay here and see Jon and Yuro every day eating mung bean cake. I want to try and bring the dead forest back to life.\n It\u2019s not stupid, he thought. There\u2019s no stupid. There\u2019s no impossible. There\u2019s just the darkness and what we\u2019ll do with it. He opened his mouth to tell the geezix he would help with the park, and that as much as his broken heart could, he loved it. He loved her.\n But he couldn\u2019t say it. After a moment of trying he heard the geezix snoring lightly.\n Cal put his head back against the warm computer core.\n Tomorrow, he thought. Tomorrow I\u2019ll be able to say it.\n Mike Buckley is a widely-published short story writer whose work has appeared in national journals such as The Alaska Quarterly Review, The Southern California Review, and Clarkesworld, Daily Science Fiction, and Escape Pod.

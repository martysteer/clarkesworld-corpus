Picacio is also one of the nicest people in the field, so perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that one of his most recent projects has been creating the cover and interior illustrations for the first of an iconic set of books by the nicest person in the field, Michael Moorcock. Ballantine/Del Rey is launching the new Elric trade paperback series this month with ELRIC: THE STEALER OF SOULS . I talked to Picacio about his work for Moorcock, upcoming covers for Jeffrey Ford, and a variety of other subjects . . .\n The Elric novels are not the first time you\u2019ve animated Moorcock\u2019s work with your art. Do you ever bounce ideas off of him? How well do you know him?\n The first book I ever illustrated was by Mike\u2014the 30th Anniversary edition of Behold the Man. I did the cover, interior illustrations, and full book design for that one. I\u2019ve done a few covers for his books since then. This new Elric book really feels like things coming full-circle though because not only am I working with Mike again, but this time, it\u2019s for one of the most iconic fantasy characters ever. Quick story from back when I did that Behold the Man gig . . . Rick Klaw and Ben Ostrander (editor & publisher of Mojo Press) drove me to Mike\u2019s house to discuss the project. I had done all my reading and had all kinds of questions, and I was thinking Mike would set the course and tell me what he wanted the project to look like. I mean, he\u2019s Michael Moorcock, one of the giants of the field, and I\u2019m a guy who\u2019s never done a book cover before, so I figured he\u2019d just say, \u201cHere\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do.\u201d Instead, he basically said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s in your hands. You\u2019ve got talent. I trust you to make it great.\u201d Looking back, that may have been the most important moment of my career. Mike\u2019s faith gave me huge confidence and really, I\u2019ve never looked back since. That attitude of being proactive rather than waiting to be told what to draw and paint . . . to think for myself and be an active participant in the publishing process . . . that attitude was really sparked by Mike and his trust back when I did that first gig. Last year, when I did the new Elric stuff, I had a pretty firm battleplan for what I wanted to do, and when I met with Mike to break it down with him, he just kept smiling and giving me the nod. A kind word here, a kind word there, but he again gave me virtually free reign. When I had questions, he was always quick to clarify, but never told me what to do. He\u2019s not only one of the great authors in the history of fantasy, but he\u2019s one of the great gentlemen. I\u2019ve said it before, and it still holds true\u2014I\u2019d take a bullet for the man.\n When dealing with classic material like this, do you ever worry about trying to match the vision in the heads of the many, many readers who have a specific idea of, for example, what Elric must look like?\n Early on, a good friend pulled me aside and said, \u201cNo matter what you do on Elric, you know a lot of people are gonna hate it, right?\u201d Oddly enough, that statement really took the pressure off me. I felt like, \u201chey, I might as well do my thing because there\u2019s no way to please everyone, so let\u2019s just go for it.\u201d Like I said before, Mike expects out of an illustrator what any creator should expect of themselves \u2013 he expects you to bring the absolute most potent and personal vision you can offer to the audience at that given moment. He doesn\u2019t expect my way to look like Yoshitaka Amano or Michael Whelan or James Cawthorn or anyone else. And hell, I\u2019d be disappointed in myself, if my stuff turned out that way. There\u2019s a history of greats that preceded me, and if I\u2019m not adding any fresh insight or vision to the lineage, then what\u2019s the use, really? So I expect myself to bring something fresh and new to the icon. However, along with that, it\u2019s possible that some fans who see the character a certain way may not embrace my way immediately. That\u2019s totally cool; that\u2019s part of the biz.\n Did you do any research into prior Elric covers? If so, did you discover anything Clarkesworld readers might find of interest?\n Yeah, I was already aware of a lot of the great Elric stuff, but I went back and studied what I thought worked and what didn\u2019t. Like I said, Amano, Whelan, and Cawthorn are a given. Robert Gould, Walt Simonson, Brom, and others . . . I went back and looked at what they each brought. There\u2019s no seminal research volume entitled The Art of Michael Moorcock\u2019s Elric or something (although it would be nice if one existed, wouldn\u2019t it?). It\u2019s too bad that there isn\u2019t more Cawthorn Elric imagery in print. What\u2019s cool about him is he was there with Mike in those seminal days when the character was first finding his way. He\u2019s the very first Elric illustrator, and I know Mike still considers his b/w ink illustrations to be amongst the very strongest Elric work ever done.\n You\u2019ve also recently done the interlocking art for the reissues of Jeffrey Ford\u2019s Well-Built City trilogy. That art seems very different in tone and execution, in some ways, from the Elric material. How would you describe the difference? (In terms of process, etc.)\n Yeah, the two really are extremely different. I\u2019m proud of both, but I\u2019m especially proud that I did both simultaneously. I think true artists thoughout history not only respond to time and context, but aren\u2019t slaves to a single method or approach. So these two projects gave me a chance to measure myself a bit. The Elric interiors are all straight traditional pencil on Crescent illustration board. No more, no less. On the other hand, the Well-Built City trilogy is a big shadowbox assemblage of oil paintings on masonite surrounded by found objects and ephemera, all housed in a custom-built box. I was working on the Well-Built City for the better part of a year, but it was a long deadline for that one, so I was able to interweave it between Elric and all of my other cover work.\n When did you start creating art?\n Yikes . . . loaded question. Some might say I\u2019ve barely begun to start creating \u201cart!\u201d As far as when I started doing professional freelance illustration work full-time . . . spring 2001. I had been freelancing professionally part-time doing book covers and editorial work since \u201995 when I did the BEHOLD THE MAN book. I was holding down a day job working in residential architecture from the time I got out of college (late \u201992), all the way until spring 2001. So the cover work soaked up most of my non-architectural waking hours, during those years. It hasn\u2019t been the most conventional route toward becoming an artist, but I guess I\u2019m a late bloomer.\n You have a whole book devoted to your art\u2014just a beautiful, wonderful exhibition, really. As a kid, as a teenager, in college\u2014did you ever visualize that moment? Did you think, \u201cSome day I\u2019m going to have a book of my art?\u201d And what else did you think about beyond the art itself as you were developing your craft?\n As a kid, I always believed I would eventually write and illustrate comics for a living. All the way into my 20\u2019s, I figured that\u2019s where I\u2019d eventually be, even when I was paying my dues in the architecture world. Of course, the way it worked out, the early self-published comics I did caught the attention of book publishers (namely Mojo Press) and I ended up where I am now\u2014completely in love with book cover illustration for sf, fantasy and horror. So I guess the answer is \u201cno\u201d . . . I don\u2019t think I dreamed all along of having my own art book. Cheesy as it sounds though, what I did always hope for was that my art would make a difference . . . that it would make an impact. Back when I was a kid, I dreamed of hanging out with great writers and artists I idolized, and doing work that could be worthy of an audience.\n The truth is, when I\u2019m about to start a new picture, I always get the same crazy feeling . . . that anything\u2019s possible and the new thing I\u2019m about to do has a chance to be the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s like falling in love. Of course, the picture inevitably falls short, and then here comes the next picture, and that crazy feeling comes back again, and so on, and so on. So yeah, I think I\u2019ve got plenty of megalomania to spare, but it always comes down to the joy of that drawing in front of me.\n What gives you the most pleasure about the whole process of creating art?\n Surprising myself . . . sometimes it might be a reaction to an accident . . . sometimes it might be a solution to problems that I didn\u2019t anticipate. Most of the time, it\u2019s things that may be barely apparent to anyone but me. It could be a series of textures or brush strokes that come together in a way that\u2019s better than I imagined . . . maybe it\u2019s a compositional brainstorm that arrives in the nick of time . . . it\u2019s definitely the surprises.\n You\u2019re exceedingly generous to other artists and I know you\u2019re more than willing to help out new artists. Who have you seen in the last couple of years that you believe we\u2019ll be hearing a lot more from in the next decade?\n I think more and more Westerners are realizing how much phenomenal non-American talent is out there. It\u2019s not just all about the Americans and the Brits any more, if it ever was to begin with. Shaun Tan has been a monster for years in his home country of Australia, but he\u2019s finally broken out huge here in America with his book The Arrival. At any rate, it\u2019s hard to call him a secret when he\u2019s already won two World Fantasy Awards, but he\u2019s always terrific. Aleksi Briclot is doing amazing mixed-media work over in Paris. I like a couple of Raul Cruz\u2019s latest spacescape oils a lot; he\u2019s based in Mexico City. Other artists that\u2019ve really struck me lately: Nic Klein (Germany); Xiao Chen Fu (China); Joao Ruas (Brazil); Skan Srisuwan (Thailand); and Maurizio Manzieri (Italy), amongst others. We\u2019re seeing more and more international talent getting American exposure. That\u2019s a good thing.\n What else are you currently working on?\n I\u2019m juggling a few hot ones right now\u2014a couple of wraparound book covers\u2014one\u2019s for Lou Anders\u2019 Fast Forward 2; the other is for Robert Silverberg\u2019s Son of Man (both for Pyr); a couple of STAR TREK covers for Simon & Schuster/Pocket. Around all that, I\u2019m diving into the aforementioned cover and interiors for the sixth and final ELRIC edition from Del Rey. So I get the honor of bookending that series, and that\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019ll be great to see the work of my fellow ELRIC artists in the series\u2014Michael Kaluta (Book 2 and Book 5); Steve Ellis (Book 3); and Justin Sweet (Book 4). 2008 should be an interesting year. Whatever happens though, as long as I\u2019m working, I\u2019m happy.\n (A small portion of this interview first appeared on Amazon\u2019s Omnivoracious blog.)\n Jeff VanderMeer is an award-winning writer with books published in over 20 countries.

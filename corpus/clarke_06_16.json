I\u2019m one of those people who is tortured by that field of white. In its presence, all my ideas fade to nothing. I used to think that public speaking was my nemesis. I still don\u2019t like it, but at least there I have someone to bounce off of and I can\u2019t fall back on the delete key. This is probably another good reason for me to avoid time travel or temporal rewinding: I\u2019d put myself in an endless loop of revision and freezing.\nOne of the main reasons I continue to do these editorials, though, is to break the cycle. I have this strange belief that one day the words will just flow. (I can hear the authors in the room laughing hysterically. Please permit me to have my delusion in peace.) Even if I don\u2019t have that breakthrough moment, this journey will help me become more comfortable and confident with my words.\nIn many ways, lacking that skill has helped me as an editor. It makes me have even more respect for the talent of the people behind the stories that land on my desk. It\u2019s also one of the reasons I find negative review bloggers so distasteful\u2014they use that skill to promote themselves at the expense of others. I\u2019d much rather take the high road: move on, find something you like, and then celebrate it.\nI\u2019ve discussed this before in previous editorials. If we want short fiction to thrive, we have a responsibility to spread the word and promote the works we\u2019ve enjoyed. There are many ways to do this, but it needs to be focused, respectful, and timely. More specifically, it needs to be done in locations that are relevant to the audience you are trying to attract. Your blog is nice, but adding Twitter or Amazon might have a bigger impact.\nReviewing isn\u2019t for everyone, mind you. I really wanted to do my part and find a way to contribute to a positive conversation about short fiction. I tried writing reviews. The blank screen tormented me and it took a while to realize that I wasn\u2019t following the path that best utilized my skills. Instead, I changed tactics and launched Forever Magazine as a way of bringing back some of the stories I\u2019ve enjoyed. When I go full-time this year, I hope to be able to do a bit more with that project.\nNot long after announcing Forever, another opportunity to celebrate short fiction fell into my lap: Night Shade Books offered me a contract to edit a new year\u2019s best anthology series. The first volume of The Best Science Fiction of the Year comes out this month. It\u2019s been an intimidating project, but one I\u2019m quite proud of. Here are the thirty-one stories included in the first volume:\n- \u201cToday I Am Paul\u201d by Martin L. Shoemaker\n- \u201cCalved\u201d by Sam J. Miller\n- \u201cThree Bodies at Mitanni\u201d by Seth Dickinson\n- \u201cThe Smog Society\u201d by Chen Quifan\n- \u201cIn Blue Lily\u2019s Wake\u201d by Aliette de Bodard\n- \u201cHello, Hello\u201d by Seanan McGuire\n- \u201cFolding Beijing\u201d by Hao Jingfang\n- \u201cCapitalism in the 22nd Century\u201d by Geoff Ryman\n- \u201cHold-Time Violations\u201d by John Chu\n- \u201cWild Honey\u201d by Paul McAuley\n- \u201cSo Much Cooking\u201d by Naomi Kritzer\n- \u201cBannerless\u201d by Carrie Vaughn\n- \u201cAnother Word for World\u201d by Ann Leckie\n- \u201cThe Cold Inequalities\u201d by Yoon Ha Lee\n- \u201cIron Pegasus\u201d by Brenda Cooper\n- \u201cThe Audience\u201d by Sean McMullen\n- \u201cEmpty\u201d by Robert Reed\n- \u201cGypsy\u201d by Carter Scholz\n- \u201cViolation of the TrueNet Security Act\u201d by Taiyo Fujii\n- \u201cDamage\u201d by David D.

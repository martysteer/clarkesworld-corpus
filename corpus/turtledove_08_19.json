People who live there say the Vikings carried it off a thousand years ago. Looking at them and listening to the Scandinavian words in their Yorkshire dialect, you may easily believe the Vikings left a lot more recently than that, if they ever left at all.\n Beautiful country, northern Yorkshire. The dales and the fells and the tall barrens with glaciers snaking down from them . . . Not the kind of landscape I\u2019d been used to in Glasgow, but it grew on me the longer I stayed in Thrsk.\n Wotan and Donner Rengaw, of whose veterinary practice I formed a small but growing part, loved Thrsk, too, though they were no more Yorkshiremen than I. They also loved the people whose stock they helped\u2014except when those people didn\u2019t pay their bills, which happened all too often. Anybody who doubts Yorkshire country farmers are slow with their silver has yet to meet one.\n Oh. Wotan and Donner? When I first went to Thrsk in those prewar days, I wondered if I\u2019d find a pair of fierce Teutons with swastika buttons in their lapels. But no. They were quite comfortably Anglo-Saxon. Wotan made light of it, saying their mother had been frightened by an opera. Donner grew tight-lipped whenever the subject was raised, so I soon stopped raising it.\n Down in the dales, the farmers were much like farmers anywhere else, even if they did expect a good deal in the way of value for their money. In the higher country, though, I wondered not only whether the Vikings had ever left but whether the Ice Age had ever abated. The cold winds blowing off the glaciers made me want to keep one eye peeled for cave bears, dire wolves, saber-toothed tigers, or other relics of bygone days.\n Such monsters, of course, had vanished from England and Wales and Scotland in Roman times, though they lingered in Ireland with the Irish elk and the aurochs until after the Norman conquest. Nor had anyone in Yorkshire set eyes on a woolly rhinoceros since the days of Queen Elizabeth, or those of James I at the very latest.\n Mammoths, though, mammoths were a different story. Like mahouts in far-off India, the canny Yorkshiremen worked out that getting work from their enormous neighbors was more profitable than slaughtering them wholesale. And that long tradition lingered still in those days when I was new in Thrsk, especially on the highlands too rugged or rocky for tractors. Mammoths gave the veterinary trade around there a fillip it got in few other places outside the Far East.\n I was in the surgery doing our small-animal business one bright but chilly spring morning. (Bright, warm spring mornings come seldom to Thrsk.) I\u2019d just taken ten stitches from the side of a cat that had quarreled with a dog when the phone rang. The cat, a tough old tom named Toby, was mild as milk as long as he sat on his mistress\u2019 lap. Mrs. Aldiss said he\u2019d actually won the fight, but he hadn\u2019t come off unscathed.\n She was fumbling in her coin purse to pay me when the housekeeper stuck her head into the antiseptic-smelling room and said, \u201cSorry to bother you, Mister Holley, but it\u2019s Wilf Latchett from up on Longyoke Fells. He sounds a bit upset.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m coming, Missus Kitchen,\u201d I said at once. You had to be tough to live on Longyoke Fells; if you weren\u2019t, you\u2019d freeze or starve or both together. The ice lay very near there. Wilf Latchett and his family were suited to their rugged home. He took everything as it came. I found it hard to imagine him upset. Yet I couldn\u2019t doubt Mrs. Kitchen. As I hurried towards the phone, I did add, \u201cMissus Aldiss was about to give me the last two and six of the bill for Toby.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll get it,\u201d the housekeeper assured me. She knew as well as I, we\u2019d never see it if she didn\u2019t.\n \u201cThanks,\u201d I said, and then, a moment later as I picked up the telephone, \u201cGeorge Holley here, Mister Latchett. How can I help you?\u201d\n \u201cIs Mister Wotan there? Or even Mister Donner?\u201d\n I heard such things a good deal when I was new to those parts. The crofters were used to the Rengaw brothers, where I was just a stranger they\u2019d hired. But the Yorkshiremen did warm to me once they saw I could do the job all right. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but they\u2019re on call,\u201d I said to Wilf Latchett. \u201cTell me what wants doing. I\u2019ll handle it as best I can.\u201d\n The telephone wires carried his sigh to me. \u201cWell, it\u2019s Awd Bill,\u201d he said. Before I could enquire as to what manner of beast Old Bill might me, he went on, \u201c\u2019E\u2019s gone an\u2019 broke a toosk off short, \u2019e \u2019as.\u201d\n \u201cA . . . tusk?\u201d I echoed faintly. Mammoth work was a treat I hadn\u2019t yet enjoyed. Well, it seemed I was about to.\n \u201cAye, a toosk. D\u2019ye think I\u2019m jestin\u2019 with ye, young man?\u201d Mr. Latchett said. \u201cBroke it on a stone in t\u2019dirt, \u2019e did.\u201d Up on Longyoke Fells, the dirt was more stones than anything else.\n I\u2019d studied animal dentistry at veterinary school in Glasgow, but dentistry on mammoths is not your ordinary animal dentistry. Thinking how unhappy such a large patient might be also made me think of something else. \u201cAh, Mister Latchett,\u201d I said, \u201cOld Bill . . . He\u2019s been fixed, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d If I sounded hopeful and anxious, well, I was.\n But Mr. Latchett said, \u201cOh, aye. T\u2019awd vet, \u2019e took care of it years gone by. \u2019E said a mammoth wi\u2019 \u2019is stones was plumb dangerous, an\u2019 Ah reckon \u2019e knew what \u2019e was talkin\u2019 aboot.\u201d\n I reckoned the same, and blessed the old vet\u2014the man from whom Wotan had purchased the practice a few years earlier. \u201cVery good, Mister Latchett,\u201d I said, hoping it was. \u201cI\u2019ll be up as soon as I can.\u201d\n \u201cAh hope ye can do summat, young man,\u201d the farmer said. \u201cAwd Bill, \u2019e\u2019s none too pleased wi\u2019 having but the one diggin\u2019 shovel.\u201d\n \u201cEr\u2014yes,\u201d I said. Mammoths used their tusks to grub some of their food out of the ground. How well would Old Bill get along without a matched set, even if I could properly repair the remaining stump or stub or whatever the proper word was?\n One thing at a time, though. Making that repair\u2014if I could do it\u2014had to come first. I said my goodbyes to Wilf Latchett, made sure the surgery held no one in urgent need of help, and then threw into my traveling satchel whatever I thought might be useful in this unusual case. That dealt with, I went out to the shed and tossed the satchel into the elderly, spavined Morris Minor Wotan let me use.\n The Minor had a self-starter, but that was long deceased. Its designers having perhaps anticipated such flaws, it also had a crank. That didn\u2019t always make the engine turn over, either, but it did then. The shed housing the Minor forthwith commenced to fill with noxious fumes. I quickly backed the car out into the open air to give myself a chance to breathe.\n Away I went, trailing more smoke behind me. People in the street waved as I clattered past. No one seemed upset at the Minor\u2019s stream of exhaust; every third car in those days smoked the same way. Fine-tuning motors was an idea whose time had not yet come.\n Thrsk is not a village, but it is no great city, either. I soon found myself in the countryside, climbing up past the dales to the fells. Before very long at all, I was glad for my tweed jacket. Snow lingered on north-facing slopes. The wind off the glaciers reminded me of the days when all Britain lay beneath them. By the way that wind felt, those days had ceased only a fortnight before at the earliest.\n The road grew steeper. No crew had come up these slopes with fresh macadam for many a long year. To negotiate the bumps and the grade, I had to drive the Minor in first gear. That dropped my speed not quite to zero, but as near as made no difference. It hardly mattered. I wasn\u2019t holding up traffic; mine was the only car on a very long, very lonely stretch of road.\n Just before I rounded the last bend and reached Wilf Latchett\u2019s farm, three or four musk oxen bounded away in alarm. They run wild up near the ice and are most shy of men, having been hunted so much for so long.\n I started standing on the brake pedal well before I reached the gate. The lining was but a memory\u2014the metal shoe squealed against the metal drum. For all my efforts, the Minor glided thirty yards past before the auto in motion became an auto at rest.\n Wilf Latchett stood at the gate watching me walk back to him, veterinary satchel in hand. No tweed jacket or sheepskin coat for him. He wore only a collarless shirt. His one concession to the climate was that it had long sleeves. \u201cNow then, Mister \u2019Olley, I\u2019m right glad to see ye,\u201d he said, and opened the gate so I could come through.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to wait out here, Wilf,\u201d I said. How long had he been standing out in the cold? From the moment he set down the phone? It wouldn\u2019t have surprised me a bit. Yorkshiremen drank in such courtesy with their mothers\u2019 milk. They would sooner have seen their holdings sacked than make an expected guest open a gate for himself.\n \u201c\u2019Tweren\u2019t nothin\u2019,\u201d Wilf said now with a shrug. He was a fair, ruddy man in his fifties, the straw-colored hair under his cloth cap just beginning to go gray. His face looked younger than his years, his battered, knobby-knuckled hands much older. The big veins just under his skin stood out like tree roots in eroded soil.\n \u201cTake me to Old Bill,\u201d I said as he closed up behind me.\n \u201cAye,\u201d he said, and he was off. His Wellingtons clumped on the dirt and the new grass, still sparse and pale green up here where spring remained barely more than a rumor.\n Most of the soil atop that cold, windswept hill was thin and poor, judging by the paltry growth it raised. Yet the garden behind the stone farmhouse and the fields on the far slope seemed far more prosperous than they had any business being. The aroma rising from the garden gave me a clue I did not need to be Hercule Poirot to unravel. \u201cDo you use mammoth dung for fertilizer, Wilf?\u201d I asked.\n He nodded. \u201cAye, that we do. Nowt like it for makin\u2019 plants grow tall.\u201d He pointed towards the barn, which was\u2014and needed to be\u2014much larger than his home. \u201cAwd Bill, \u2019e\u2019s in there.\u201d\n Again, I needed to be no great fictional detective to deduce this. My own little gray cells, poor as they were, sufficed nicely. \u201cWill you come in with me, Wilf?\u201d I said. \u201cHe knows you better and likes you better than he does me.\u201d Even a dog you can carry in a handbag is liable to nip a stranger. Attention from a out-of-temper woolly mammoth might prove a bit more serious.\n Wilf Latchett nodded again. \u201cRight glad to do it, Mister Holley.\u201d In he went. I followed.\n It was warmer within than without, though nearly night-dark. The walls shielded us from the merciless wind outside, and Old Bill was big enough to be his own heater. The same odor I had smelled by the garden was thicker and fresher here.\n Wilf smelled it, too. With a chuckle, he said, \u201cMy lads, they\u2019ll ha\u2019 themsels a bit o\u2019 muckin\u2019 out to do.\u201d He pointed towards a thin white object leaning against the wall. \u201cAh brought in the boosted toosk, in case ye needed it.\u201d\n Wanting to give Old Bill a moment to get used to my presence, I went over and hefted the broken tusk. Four or five feet of ivory, it had to weigh a good fifty pounds: heavier than I expected. \u201cIt will be worth a fair bit to you,\u201d I said. \u201cIvory\u2014heh, heh\u2014doesn\u2019t grow on trees.\u201d\n \u201cAh thought o\u2019 that, Ah did,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cAh\u2019d liefer ha\u2019 Awd Bill whole, though.\u201d\n \u201cI understand,\u201d I said, and then, because I couldn\u2019t put it off any longer, \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at him, shall we?\u201d If I sounded more cheerful and less nervous than I was, people often do.\n \u201cCome on with me, then,\u201d Wilf said matter-of-factly, and went over to the great gray-brown beast stuffing hay into its mouth with its trunk. Instead of running the other way, I followed.\n Old Bill didn\u2019t turn to look at us, but his ears twitched in our direction as we drew near. They were smaller than those of an Indian elephant, much less those of an African. The tropical varieties use their ears to radiate away excess heat, a worry seldom found in subglacial Yorkshire.\n Wilf set a fond hand on the side of the mammoth\u2019s face, not far from where the broken tusk erupted. \u201cStay steady, awd boy,\u201d he said. \u201cT\u2019 vet, \u2019e\u2019s \u2019ere to help you. \u2019E\u2019ll not \u2019urt you any more\u2019n he must.\u201d\n I hoped the beast was listening. Stepping up beside Wilf Latchett, I got my first look at what remained of the tusk. Sure enough, there was the pulp cavity, exposed to air and dirt and germs. As I examined it, Old Bill examined me. For all the mammoth\u2019s bulk, its eye wasn\u2019t a great deal larger than my own. It relied more on hearing and sense of smell\u2014and on touch, as the end of its trunk explored me. It was like being felt by an enormously strong, two-fingered hand.\n \u201cLet\u2019s numb things up a bit, shall we?\u201d I said, and used a large-bore needle to give the mammoth an injection of novocaine near the base of that tooth. I wanted the nerve as much out of action as I could make it before I went to work on the damaged part of the tusk. I also squirted novocaine on the nerve ending exposed by the break. From the snuffling sound Old Bill made, he wasn\u2019t sure he cared for that, but he tolerated it. Had he taken any serious offense, I should not be setting down this tale now.\n Wilf and I stepped outside for a cigarette while the anesthetic took effect. Then, hoping I\u2019d not just smoked my last one like a man before a firing squad, I walked back into the barn.\n Horses\u2019 teeth and those of cattle are large and long-rooted, so I had some tolerably formidable dentistry tools. But those teeth do not compare to a tusk. As far as I know, elephant dentists have to improvise. Demand is not sufficient to encourage the manufacture of instruments on such a mammoth scale.\n Forgive me.\n I cleaned out the pulp cavity as far as I could reach with my misnamed \u201clarge animal\u201d tools. Old Bill did not care for that, even anesthetized, but put up with it as if he knew I did not mean to hurt him. I have seen the same from many other beasts as well.\n Having excised the nerve as far as I could reach, I cleaned the cavity with antiseptic solution. Then I inserted pointed strips of gutta-percha and used a match to seal the rubbery stuff to the tusk. \u201cThere!\u201d I said, pleased with my handiwork.\n Wilf seemed less delighted. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve done summat, any road,\u201d he allowed. \u201cBut will yon blowout patch stand up to it when Awd Bill gets to diggin\u2019 again?\u201d\n I ran into that like a mammoth tusk slamming into a buried stone. After a bit of thought, I had to admit, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cIs there aught more ye can do?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I repeated, and stood there in the great mammoth-smelling barn whilst I thought some more. After a couple of minutes, I said, \u201cThis will do for the time being, I think. But if you\u2019ll let me take the broken tusk along with me, I may be able to come up with something better, something that will last quite a while. You\u2019ll get the tusk back, I promise.\u201d Having reminded him it was valuable, I wanted to leave no doubts on that score.\n He scratched the side of his jaw. \u201cAh\u2019ll ha\u2019 to shell out more brass\u2019n just for a simple visit, won\u2019t I?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid so. I don\u2019t know how much yet\u2014I have to speak with someone down in Ripon,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll need a bit of help for what I have in mind. Do you want me to go ahead or not?\u201d\n \u201cAye, do it,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cAh\u2019d like Awd Bill as near whole and \u2019ale again as \u2019e can get. \u2019E\u2019s not just a beast o\u2019 burden. \u2019E\u2019s part o\u2019 the family, like.\u201d\n They say Yorkshire farmers are stingy, hard-bitten men. And some are, true enough. But many others see things like Wilf Latchett, and care for their stock as they would for their children. Oh, I\u2019m not saying Wilf turned up his nose at cock-a-leekie, but a mammoth has more character than a mammoth\u2019s weight of chickens.\n City bred as I am, I always enjoyed going into Ripon. Ripon may be no great city, but a city it is. However charming Thrsk is, it is no more than a town. The difference between the one and the other is not so easily defined, but is readily seen. Just for instance, Ripon had traffic lights, an amenity Thrsk was innocent of in those days.\n And Ripon had Dr. Aryeh Teitelbaum. That distinguished Jewish gentleman was Wotan and Donner\u2019s dentist, and lately mine as well. He\u2019d also given the practice much valuable advice about caring for, maintaining, and repairing teeth. Being an expert on that score gave him an advantage even if the teeth in question weren\u2019t human.\n \u201cHullo, old man!\u201d he said when I walked into his office. He had the plummiest BBC accent I\u2019d ever heard. His father, I happened to know, dealt in secondhand clothes in Birmingham. To hear him talk, though, you\u2019d guess he was to the manor born. His diction didn\u2019t falter even when he saw the broken tusk in my arms. \u201cWhere on earth did you come by that?\u201d he enquired.\n \u201cHilltop farmer up on the fells, as near the glaciers as you can get without being buried in ice,\u201d I replied.\n \u201cYou do know we don\u2019t make false teeth from ivory anymore?\u201d he said.\n \u201cI had heard that, yes.\u201d I did my best to match Aryeh dry for dry. It was the best way I knew to make him get down to business.\n He plucked at his beard. Yes, he wore one even then, when they were as few and far between as could be. His was closely trimmed, with some gray starting to show in patches on his chin. Reasonably enough, he asked, \u201cWhy did you bring it to me, then?\u201d\n \u201cI hoped you might rig some sort of replacement, prosthesis, false tusk\u2014call it what you will. Something Old Bill can use instead of what he\u2019s lost here.\u201d\n \u201cIsn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d Aryeh murmured. \u201cA farmer up near the ice . . . He\u2019ll not have a pair of threepenny bits to jingle in his pocket, will he?\u201d\n \u201cHe isn\u2019t rich,\u201d I agreed.\n I might as well not have spoken. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. The challenge of it alone is worth the candle,\u201d he said, more to himself than to me. He might have forgotten I was there. Then he remembered me again. Most of the time, the expression on his roundish face was mild, even amused. Now his gaze sharpened. \u201cYou won\u2019t have taken an impression of the remaining end of the tusk, will you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.\u201d\n Aryeh sighed at my many failings. Wotan often did the same, but on a different note. The dentist said, \u201cCan you go back up there and get the contours of the last foot or so? I\u2019ll want to shape a socket for the false tooth, you understand.\u201d By the way he said it, he assumed I understood nothing. When it came to dentistry, that was a fair assumption.\n \u201cI can, certainly,\u201d I said, hoping the Morris Minor would agree with me; it was a savage climb. \u201cBut what shall I use to make the impression? Modeling clay? I can pick some up, I suppose.\u201d\n \u201cWait here. Don\u2019t move even a muscle. Not a muscle, do you hear? I\u2019ll be back directly.\u201d Aryeh disappeared into the bowels of his office. He emerged in due course with a carton he carried in both hands. \u201cHere you go, old man. This is the compound I use to take impressions for crowns and false teeth. You\u2019ll need more than I\u2019m in the habit of using, I fear.\u201d\n \u201cThanks ever so much! Will it come off the tusk once it dries, or will I need to cut it in half?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cIt should come off. If not, you\u2019ll do whatever you have to do, and I\u2019ll adjust accordingly,\u201d Aryeh said.\n After thanking him again, I drove back up to the Latchett farm without phoning ahead. The Minor just about made it up the last steep bit. This time, remembering where the gate was, I trod on the brake well in advance, and slowed to a halt only a little bit beyond the hinged opening.\n As I\u2019d hoped, one of Wilf\u2019s boys was out in the rocky fields. Ralph Latchett, a taller, ruddier version of his father, opened the gate for me. \u201cWhy art tha back so soon, Doc?\u201d he asked. A doctor for humans or a dentist is invariably called Doctor, a veterinarian is inevitably tagged Doc.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been down to see Doctor Teitelbaum about Old Bill\u2019s tusk,\u201d I said. \u201cHe wants me to make an impression of the stump.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to do summat for the mammut\u2019?\u201d Like his father, Ralph sounded anxious.\n \u201cHe thinks he will.\u201d\n \u201cHuh. \u2019E allus reckons \u2019e can do aught, that \u2019un,\u201d Ralph said, an opinion little different from my own. He went on, \u201cLet\u2019s \u2019ope \u2019e \u2019as the right of it this time.\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWill you take me to Old Bill?\u201d I didn\u2019t much care to be alone with the mammoth in that great drafty barn.\n \u201cI will, sir, and right gladly, too.\u201d He set a pace that I, with my arms full of PATENT IMPRESSIONIZING COMPOUND (it said on the carton), was hard-pressed to match. Recalling the things people said about elephants\u2019 memories, I hoped the beast was in a forgiving mood.\n As he had been the last time I came in, Old Bill was eating. Since he couldn\u2019t forage for himself so well, the Latchetts were keeping him in hay. He snuffled in my direction. His tail and ears twitched a bit as I came up to him, but only a bit. He seemed willing to tolerate me, if not to welcome me as a bosom friend.\n I molded the compound around the tusk\u2019s stump. It was, one of the boxes inside the carton informed me, made up largely of alginate, whatever alginate was. The box also said it had a setting time of about four minutes. The way I was using it, I gave it twice as long.\n Old Bill, I should add, accepted my attentions as calmly as if I were a Latchett and he\u2019d known me for years. When I said as much, Ralph nodded. \u201c\u2019E\u2019s a good \u2019un, our Bill is,\u201d he said. I could only nod back; any mammoth not a \u201cgood \u2019un\u201d would be far too dangerous to keep near people.\n As I worked the impressionizing compound off his tusk, Old Bill did not flinch or show any other sign or pain or distress. That told me the procedure I\u2019d done a few days before had probably rooted out, you might say, any incipient infection in the tusk\u2019s stub. I also checked the gutta-percha seal at the end of the stub. Even under a magnifying glass, it seemed intact.\n \u201cAll as\u2019t should be, Mister Holley?\u201d Ralph asked.\n \u201cI think so. I hope so,\u201d I answered. Though new to the practice, I had already learned not to promise success I couldn\u2019t be sure of delivering.\n \u201cEven so much is good t\u2019hear, any road.\u201d Ralph might have grown up far from city sophistication, but he understood I wasn\u2019t promising. I always appreciated things being clear between veterinarian and client. Then he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the scot this new bit o\u2019 business?\u201d\n \u201cNot a farthing,\u201d I told him, pleased that I could. \u201cDoctor Teitelbaum doesn\u2019t want payment. He said he\u2019s never had the chance to work on a mammoth before.\u201d\n \u201cHuh!\u201d Ralph said. \u201c\u2019E took our brass fine last year, when \u2019e yanked my bottom wisdom teeth.\u201d He paused, visibly running his tongue around the inside of his mouth. \u201cThey don\u2019t \u2019urt no more\u2014I will say that.\u201d\n I took the mold back to the car and drove to Ripon once more. Going downhill in the Minor could be even more exciting than going up. Climbing a hill, you wondered if you\u2019d make it to the top. Descending, you wondered fearfully how fast you\u2019d be going when you got to the bottom and whether you could stop if you had to. Any slope at all gave the brakes a challenge they really weren\u2019t up to meeting.\n Thanks to the dearth of traffic in the high fells, I got down on to flat ground with no more than the usual pounding heart and cold perspiration. Nor did I have any mishaps parking the car down the street from Aryeh Teitelbaum\u2019s office. The mold survived the drive unscathed, too. I took it inside.\n This time, I had to sit half an hour in the waiting room, as he was busy with a patient. When the man came out, he nodded to me. He was feeling of his jaw, as if amazed he didn\u2019t hurt more. Sure enough, he said, \u201cReminds me o\u2019 the trenches in the war. The Huns finish shelling, and you go, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t catch a packet this time.\u2019\u201d Another nod and he went on his way.\n A moment later, Aryeh stepped into the waiting room. I gave him the mold I\u2019d made. He looked at it from the side, then peered into it to see what the end looked like. \u201cNicely done, George. Very nicely done indeed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what I need. I don\u2019t believe I could have done better myself, even if the thought of getting near the brute didn\u2019t scare me spitless.\u201d\n I happened to know he\u2019d won a Military Medal in Belgium in \u201918, when things looked black indeed. Not that he\u2019d told me himself, you understand; he would have gone on the rack before bragging like that. But I\u2019d heard it from more than one man who\u2019d served with him. And, things being as they are, Jews have to show twice the bravery to win half the credit.\n So all I said was, \u201cWill it do what wants doing?\u201d\n \u201cI think it should,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must give me a week or ten days now. I shan\u2019t be doing this alone. But at the end of that time I may have something to make your mammoth a bit less lopsided.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll come back in ten days\u2019 time, then,\u201d I said.\n \u201cRing before you do,\u201d he warned. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t want you to make the trip for nothing if it isn\u2019t ready.\u201d And so it was agreed.\n A good thing he had me telephone before going back to Ripon. When I did, Aryeh told me he needed two days more. He was all apologies, which I ignored. The man was doing me and the Latchetts and Old Bill a considerable favor. If he and whatever confederates he\u2019d enlisted needed a bit more time, then they did, that was all.\n I checked again before driving down. On getting the green light, I chugged to Ripon in the old Minor. I had no idea what I\u2019d see. \u201cGood morning, George,\u201d Aryeh said when I walked into his office. After we shook hands he brought me the broken tusk. \u201cHere you are. Your Mister Latchett will make the best of this. Not long on cash, you said?\u201d\n \u201cNot a bit of it,\u201d I agreed. \u201cBut he worries more about Old Bill than any of that.\u201d\n \u201cHe knows what matters to him. Pity more men don\u2019t,\u201d the dentist said. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me for a moment\u2014\u201d Aryeh ducked into his inner office. He always had a flair for the dramatic.\n No more than two minutes later, out he came again, carrying another tusk, or rather a denture, I supposed you\u2019d say, doing duty for the genuine article. It was almost as creamy-white as the true mammoth tooth. Only the socket at the end Aryeh held uppermost really gave away its being man-made.\n \u201cGosh, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cWhat\u2019s it made of?\u201d\n \u201cConcrete,\u201d Aryeh answered. \u201cJosh Doggett, who\u2019s in the building trades here, lent a hand with it after I finished the mold. It\u2019s painted now, to look more like ivory. That will wear off with use and time. Unless Will Latchett touches it up now and again, he\u2019ll have a mammoth with a two-toned tusk.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s made of concrete?\u201d I said doubtfully. \u201cIsn\u2019t it all too likely to break again?\u201d\n \u201cI dare hope not, anyhow,\u201d he answered. \u201cA couple of steel reinforcing rods run the length of it. Getting them bent to the proper curvature was what held me up. Now that they are, though, Josh is confident it will last about as long as the unbroken tusk. If reinforced concrete is good enough for skyscrapers, he says, it\u2019s likely good enough for mammoths, too.\u201d\n \u201cI hope so,\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cWill the socket fit smoothly over the broken end of the tusk? Should I cement it into place?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d cement it. I\u2019ll let you have some dental cement, the kind I use to hold crowns on tooth stumps in people\u2019s mouths.\u201d Aryeh laughed, too. \u201cI never have to apply it with a paintbrush, though. It dries fairly fast, so you\u2019d do well not to waste time between putting it on and placing the tusk.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cI understand. You\u2019ve put an awful lot of time and work and supplies into this, Aryeh. Are you sure there isn\u2019t some way I can square it with you?\u201d\n He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure. I\u2019ve never had the chance to work on this scale before. It\u2019s taught me a few things, though heaven only knows if I\u2019ll ever get the chance to use them again.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re aces in my book,\u201d I said. He waved that aside. Like a lot of generous men, he was embarrassed by his own generosity.\n I took the denture out to the auto, and then the veritable mammoth tusk. People on the sidewalk gave me curious looks, but Ripon is not such a big city that anyone had the crust to ask me straight out what the devil I was doing. Aryeh, meanwhile, loaded me down with enough dental cement for a regiment\u2019s worth of human sufferers.\n Then it was up to the edge of the glacier once more. My poor elderly Minor did not approve. The motor growled and whined like an unhappy dog as the car climbed and climbed. The jaunt never failed to fascinate me, though. Not so long ago, as the geologists measure such things, all Britain lay beneath a mile of ice. Even after it began to retreat, after the Channel cut our island kingdom off from the Continent, for long centuries places like Dover and Portsmouth were as subarctic as the Yorkshire fells are today.\n The air had that icy chill, but also that icy purity. If you could make a living here, you could make a living anywhere. I would have taken my hat off to Wilf Latchett and his hearty brood, but the chilly wind might have snatched it from my hand and blown it downhill towards warmer climes.\n Wilf was out in the fields not far from the gate when I drove up. He raised rye and oats, which had a chance to ripen even in the short upland growing season. Sometimes, if the year looked like being warmish, he would risk a bit of barley, but never wheat. Wheat was for farmers down in the dales, who could count on frost-free days into October.\n Wilf came to the gate, blowing smoke from a Woodbine. \u201cWhat \u2019ave you got for me today, Doc?\u201d he asked, setting a work-ravaged hand on the latch.\n \u201cWith luck, something that will set Old Bill to rights.\u201d I left the car and drew the replacement semi-tusk out through the open rear window.\n \u201cThere\u2019s summat out of the ordinary,\u201d Wilf said, taking it from me and turning it this way and that to examine all of Aryeh Teitelbaum\u2019s handiwork. He smiled as he reached into the socket at the end; he saw at once how it would connect the new part to the whole of the mammoth. \u201c\u2019E\u2019s a right clever feller, Doctor Teitelbaum is.\u201d\n \u201cI think so, too,\u201d I said.\n He hefted the prosthetic. \u201cNot much heavier than the real ivory,\u201d he remarked. \u201cShouldn\u2019t trouble Awd Bill a bit to bear it. An\u2019 \u2019e even slapped paint on it t\u2019make it look more like t\u2019other \u2019un.\u201d\n \u201cHe said you\u2019d have to touch that up if you don\u2019t want it looking like, well, concrete after a while,\u201d I said.\n \u201cMebbe Ah will, mebbe Ah won\u2019t,\u201d Wilf said. \u201cBut concrete? Will Ah have to worry it\u2019ll break off short again?\u201d\n \u201cI hope not.\u201d I explained how Aryeh and his friend had reinforced the tusk with steel.\n \u201cBy gaw! What\u2019ll they think of next?\u201d Wilf said.\n Remembering, I also took out the broken length of ivory. \u201cAnd here\u2019s this,\u201d I said. \u201cAs I told you, it\u2019ll bring you back something for all the trouble you and Old Bill have gone through, anyhow.\u201d\n \u201cObliged, sir. Much obliged indeed. For now, ye can lay it on t\u2019grass there. I\u2019ll tend to it in good time,\u201d Wilf said. I must have given him a look, because he chuckled. \u201c\u2019Oo\u2019s going to come by and nick it, Mister \u2019Olley? Answer me that, eh?\u201d\n I set down the tusk and spread my hands. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me there.\u201d\n We walked together to the great mammoth barn. I tried to get Wilf to let me carry the replacement tusk while taking the much lighter cement himself, but he wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I had to argue him out of lugging the cement, too. He was my host, or felt he was, and didn\u2019t want a guest doing anything for himself.\n When we went inside, Old Bill gave a questioning snort. That was all\u2014by then, I\u2019d been there often enough to have reached the rank of accepted person. He may even have understood that I\u2019d come to do him good. Some animals seem to, and mammoths are uncommonly clever beasts.\n I painted the inside of the socket with cement, and the last foot or so of the tusk stump as well. When the concrete creation was in place, I made sure I had cement all around the butt end of the socket, doing my best to seal it away from the outside air.\n \u201c\u2019Ow long\u2019s it need to dry?\u201d Wilf asked.\n \u201cNot long, Aryeh said. I\u2019ll give it about ten minutes, because I\u2019m using so much more cement than he does with his patients.\u201d\n He laughed again. \u201cAye, reckon y\u2019are.\u201d He laid a hand on the side of Old Bill\u2019s great, shaggy head. \u201c\u2019Ang on, awd lad. \u2019Twon\u2019t be long.\u201d The mammoth snorted once more. Did it understand what he told it? I would say no, if you mean understand as you or I might. But it understood that a human it trusted was telling it something in reassuring tones. The mammoth stood quietly while I held the false tusk in place, waiting for the cement to set.\n Old Bill stayed so calm, I gave it an extra couple of minutes. Then I stepped away. The concrete simulacrum was a bit heavier than the ivory it replaced, thanks to the steel reinforcing rods and the socket extending its length. I wondered if that would disturb or discomfit the mammoth. It didn\u2019t seem to. And, after all, he was closer to being in balance now than he had been with his broken tusk.\n As I\u2019ve noted, mammoths and elephants do not see well, depending more on smell and hearing than on sight. There in the mammoth barn, though, I would have sworn Old Bill was trying to look down the new tusk to discover what I\u2019d done to him. He cocked his head now this way, now that. Had he been a human being, I should have said he was puzzled.\n Try as he would, he didn\u2019t get the answer he was looking for from his eyes. Then he felt the replacement tusk with his trunk. He used that for so much: to smell with, to siphon up water and squirt it into his mouth, and to pick up food and likewise convey it to his tongue and the teeth that were not tusks.\n He reminded me it could also serve as a hand. The two fingerlike projections stroked the painted concrete. Old Bill seemed particularly intrigued by the way the socket fit onto the lost tusk\u2019s stump. He explored the joining again and again. I wish I could have deciphered his grunt. Claiming an animal acts like a man is a mug\u2019s game, of course, but if I\u2019d had to put the noise into English it would have been something like How did he do that?\n Wilf Latchett thought the same. \u201cWonderin\u2019 \u2019ow it got there,\u201d he said.\n Then Old Bill walked to the closed door of the barn and turned his great head back towards Wilf, as far as it would go. I\u2019ve been cooped up in here long enough, that look said. Now that I\u2019m whole again, let me go out and be a proper mammoth again.\n Wilf hurried to open the door. No doubt Old Bill could have broken it open himself, but he seemed to appreciate the courtesy. As soon as the space would accommodate his bulk, he hurried out onto the grass.\n Up went his trunk in what looked like joy. Yes, I know I warned against anthropomorphizing, but here once more it was hard to avoid. Then he trumpeted out a blast that sounded like a dozen horn players blowing on bugles full of spit.\n A moment later, another mammoth answered, far off in the distance. \u201cAh, that\u2019ll be Dusty Rhodes\u2019 Chuzzlewit,\u201d Wilf said.\n \u201cChuzzlewit?\u201d It was hardly a name I\u2019d have expected a Yorkshire mammoth to bear.\n \u201cLikes Dickens, Dusty does. \u2019E\u2019s a good bloke any road, though,\u201d Wilf said, leaving me to make what I would of that.\n Leaving it alone seemed the better part of valor. I just said, \u201cCall me in a week to let me know how he\u2019s doing. Call me right away if he has trouble of any kind, or if he seems to be in pain. I\u2019ve never done a root canal on a mammoth before. I hope everything\u2019s all right, but I don\u2019t know that it is. And of course call me if he breaks the tusk again. Heaven forbid, I know, but it can happen.\u201d\n Wilf sketched a salute, as if I were a young, mustache-wearing first lieutenant from his Great War days. \u201cAh\u2019ll do just as ye say, Mister \u2019Olley. An\u2019 me an\u2019 Awd Bill, we\u2019re much obliged to ye, and to the dentist, and to his friend down in Ripon.\u201d\n I thanked him and headed back to the Morris Minor. Wilf came along to open the gate for me, the kind of kindness men in the high country took for granted in those days. We\u2019d almost reached the edge of the road when Old Bill trumpeted again. He sounded delighted. I hoped he was. I hoped he\u2019d stay that way.\n For the next week, I tightened up every time the telephone in the surgery rang. I knew, I knew, it would be Wilf Latchett, ringing me to report some disaster: Old Bill in distress from pain in the now nearly unreachable pulp cavity, or else the replacement tusk and some of the stump snapping off.\n Every time, it was someone else calling about something else. Every time, I took a deep breath and relaxed . . . till the telephone clamored again. On the appointed day, Wilf did telephone\u2014late in the afternoon. Mrs. Kitchen took the call. I was sewing up the hind leg of a dog who\u2019d come off second best in a scrape with some barbed wire.\n \u201cIt\u2019s Wilf Latchett, Doctor Holley!\u201d she called down the hallway.\n \u201cTalk to him for a couple of minutes, please. I\u2019m almost finished here.\u201d I made sure I did what needed doing properly, accepted the farmer\u2019s thanks and half a crown, and hurried to the telephone. As soon as Mrs. Kitchen handed me the receiver, I blurted out, \u201cHow\u2019s he doing, Wilf?\u201d\n \u201c\u2019E\u2019s capital, Mister \u2019Olley. First rate,\u201d Wilf answered. \u201cCouldn\u2019t be better. Fine fettle Awd Bill\u2019s in, yes indeed.\u201d\n Relief washed over me like the gentle rain so rare in rugged Yorkshire. Flood, yes. Drought, yes. Blizzard, often. But gentle rain, here, is more spoken of than seen. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to hear it!\u201d I said.\n \u201cWell, now, sir, I\u2019m right glad you took such good care of \u2019im,\u201d Wilf said.\n \u201cCall again if there\u2019s the least trouble,\u201d I told him, and he rang off.\n There wasn\u2019t, not that had anything to do with the replacement tusk. Old Bill lived quite happily with it for more than twenty years. Wotan put him down in the early 1960s, when a malignant mass in his bowel left him but a sad shadow of his old self. By that time, Wilf\u2019s sons were running the farm together.\n But I did have one more reminder of the story. A year or so after I put on the replacement tusk, Aryeh Teitelbaum was drilling out and filling a cavity I\u2019d got. After he\u2019d finished, he said, \u201cYour Wilf Latchett came by not so long ago.\u201d\n \u201cDid he?\u201d I said blurrily\u2014the novocaine left half my tongue numb.\n \u201cHe did.\u201d Aryeh nodded. \u201cHe gave me a fiver\u2014said he\u2019d got it from what he made off Old Bill\u2019s broken tusk. I tried to turn him down, but he wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re proud men, Yorkshire farmers,\u201d I said.\n He nodded once more. \u201cThat they are. So I passed two pounds ten to Josh Doggett and kept the other half myself. Oh, and Wilf gave me\u2014this.\u201d He reached behind him and took something off a shelf. It was a carved ivory mammoth, no bigger than the last joint of my thumb. \u201cHis wife made it, he told me, from a bit he didn\u2019t sell. Some women still weave, some knit. Kitty Latchett makes these little carvings\u2014mostly from stone, but not this one.\u201d\n \u201cNo, not this one,\u201d I agreed, and held it close to my face to get a good look. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t told me, I might have believed it went all the way back to the Ice Age. Of course, this far north that never really quite ended.\u201d\n \u201cI doubt we\u2019ve got better since, either,\u201d Aryeh said. Since the second war had started only a week or two earlier, I couldn\u2019t very well quarrel with him.\n You don\u2019t see mammoths on farms any more, though a few wild ones still wander near the edges of the glaciers. The ice is drawing back more these days. People say the world is warming up. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve lived when I have, and that I\u2019ve been able to smooth things along a bit for beasts and men.\n Harry Turtledove is an escaped Byzantine historian.

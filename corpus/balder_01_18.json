This man has lost a daughter. His kind, round face is grooved with sadness. She likes him at once, which isn\u2019t her usual MO. \u201cShe was taken two years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cMe and the wife had gone shopping, and when we came back, she was gone.\u201d\nGouda glances down at the information he brought, as requested. Photos, birth certificate, council registration. The latter form is curiously blank. She checks anyway.\n\u201cWhere was home?\u201d\nThe man stutters and it takes him several tries to answer. \u201cDordrecht.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on the registration.\u201d\nHe paws his briefcase and provides his home address. He\u2019s only lived there eighteen months. Gouda licks her lips. This is one of those strange cases she\u2019s been getting the past two years. Missing children, missing parents, missing grandparents.\n\u201cTell me about the day she went missing,\u201d Gouda says. The man, Jansen is his name, starts talking in his monotonous, broken voice. Gouda has no children, but she now knows everything about what the loss does to parents. The past two years have been one unending stream of the bereaved.\nSomething must have happened two years ago. On her map, she has circled the names of cities that come up the most. Dordrecht, The Hague, Delft, Zoetermeer, Ridderkerk. If you circle them, the center of that circle is in the middle of the sea. So far, she hasn\u2019t been able to find anyone of this kind of missing person. Still the clients keep coming, maybe because she located a few ordinary runaways. It\u2019s a lot harder now that the Internet has stopped working.\n\u201c . . . And then we called her, as we always do when we\u2019re away, and the phone number didn\u2019t exist anymore. We got one of those prerecorded messages, you know?\u201d\nGouda nods. She knows.\n\u201cHow could the phone number to our own . . . \u201d Jansen stutters, regroups. \u201cTo our house? That\u2019s just silly.\u201d\n\u201cSo it was a landline?\u201d\n\u201cWhat else could it be?\u201d\nGouda wants to ask a follow-up question, but she too finds that her tongue flaps in her mouth, not knowing what to say. Her eyes drift to the baby tablet on the table, a great little device to play solitaire and Sudoku on, but nothing like a phone. No hook, no numbers.\n\u201cHow old was your daughter at the time of her disappearance?\u201d\n\u201cSixteen.\u201d\n\u201cOld enough to leave her on her own for a night, then.\u201d\nJansen tries to say something, but nothing comes out. It\u2019s hard to talk about the missing. Everybody knows that. Evening TV is full of reality shows about the missing. And not just Dutch TV, it\u2019s happening all over the world. So if your heart aches for a child you can\u2019t quite remember, you can wallow in other people\u2019s grief all night long.\nJansen pays Gouda\u2019s retainer and leaves with a follow-up appointment in two weeks. Gouda writes up his case and adds it to her take home pile. She likes to sit in front of the TV. Her building has a working TV antenna, which makes her very popular with friends and colleagues. Before the cable stopped working she watched shows from America, mostly. They still get broadcast, but the delay has grown long. Shows have to be printed on reels, shipped across the Atlantic, recaptured on digital and broadcast via the old antenna network.\nGouda knows she has visited America once, but the weird thing is she can\u2019t remember which city she went to. But if she closes her eyes, she can hear the sirens on the streets, the honking cabs, the friendly greetings of faceless sales assistants, and the scent of hot dogs with sauerkraut. The pillows in her hotel room. Pointless stuff like that. There\u2019s just no visual to go with these sensations.\nShe walks home. She could take the tram but it clears her mind if she has her face in the wind for a bit. The sunset over the Amsterdam canals makes her feel that life has meaning. They are lined with houses that have stood for centuries, which have been lived in by people who gave the stairs their hollowed out look, the railings their patina. History does exist. Some people do know their parents, their childhood homes. It gives her the courage to plow on, even though she has this big gap in her memory and doesn\u2019t even know her real name, or who her parents were. She shares that with thousands of people, and that makes her believe that someday she will find out what happened that day, two years ago.\nIt\u2019s like there\u2019s a crater in her brain, with curling, cauterized edges, which has obliterated her memories. She probably can\u2019t get them back, burned things don\u2019t get unburned, but she would like to know what caused the impact.\nNo, that\u2019s not true. She wants to know about her childhood.\nWhen she comes home she files Jansen\u2019s information while she heats yesterday\u2019s Chinese. There\u2019s many entries in the J folder. She browses through them while the microwave buzzes. They\u2019re all the same, except the date.\nThat\u2019s so strange. Mr. Jansen has been by many times with the same story. Gouda never finds his daughter. He pays the bill, she closes the file. And then the same things happens again and again. Is that why Jansen\u2019s unremarkable round face looks so familiar? She wonders why he keeps finding the same private detective, her, every time. The microwave pings and she puts the old files back and the new one on the table.\nGouda stands still, hands spread in a forgotten gesture. Thoughts slide away from her. The smell of food and the growling of her stomach bring her back to the present. Dinner time.\nShe sits down with the plate on her lap and picks up the stack of old picture books she got on the Sunday market. She opens them where she left off last evening and looks at photographs of Dutch towns. She has one memory of her childhood. An old man and an old woman walk with her at the edge of a small canal, not in Amsterdam or she would know it, and they smile at the camera.\nIf she looks at picture books long enough, someday she will find the town. As she turns page after brittle, yellowed page, she combats the nagging feeling that at one point she could have found out about this faster, but she can\u2019t remember how.\nShe almost turns the page, mechanically, before she registers the picture properly. A canal, gabled houses, but tiny, like a miniature Amsterdam. Balk, Friesland, the picture heading reads. This is it. This is her childhood memory. She strokes the shiny, heavy page. It\u2019s real. She exists. Holding the book against her face, she inhales deeply. But of course the old paper doesn\u2019t smell like the canal did in her memory. Like stagnant water, hot brick, sticky remnants of ice cream on her little chubby hand.\nGouda puts the book back on the stack, then realizes what she\u2019s doing, and puts it in a place of honor on the chimney mantle. She eyes the teetering towers of old books on the floor. Now she won\u2019t have to go through them anymore. Her Sundays are now free. But this can\u2019t be it. She needs to do more. She\u2019ll go to that place, Balk. Maybe she can find her family. Although the probability of that happening is still small, as she doesn\u2019t know their names. Maybe her grandparents were just visiting Balk on holiday. And they\u2019re probably dead by now as well.\nThe momentary elation evaporates. She makes a pot of tea and opens the Jansen file. She\u2019s going to sketch out a plan for tomorrow before her bedtime reading schedule. One day she\u2019ll read a book she knows already. That too, could be a clue.\nGouda retraces the route the Jansen family remembers taking to arrive in Amsterdam. She travels to Pynacker. Mr. Jansen doesn\u2019t quite remember getting on the train there, but where else could he have come from? As she gets off in Pynacker Station, she can see where the rails end in a double stop. Pynacker is a terminal station, trains cannot go through.\nIn front of the train station, a fan of directions greet her. Library, City Hall, shopping center. There is one little pointer that has been scratched out and stickered over so many times she can\u2019t read what it says. That must be the one that leads her to the Edge.\nShe buys a cup of coffee, her one indulgence today. Coffee has gotten a lot more expensive because the airplanes don\u2019t work anymore. On the other hand, the world has become warmer and in some places wetter, so coffee plantations in Spain and France are slated to reproduce the good stuff in a couple of years. It\u2019s as weird as the thought of Dutch vineyards. Polar bears must be turning in their graves, poor things.\nAs she digs in her purse for change, a sheaf of ticket stubs falls out. She checks them idly before tossing them in the trash. They are all tickets to Pynacker. She\u2019s been here before, many times. But why? And worse, why doesn\u2019t she remember?\nShe notes the mystery down in her little notebook and re-pockets the ticket stubs. There\u2019s a reason she kept them. Maybe this little nugget of information will help her forward in her search.\nShe follows the tourists to the edge of the water. It\u2019s busier than she expected; cranes and boats are laying the foundations for levees. There\u2019s a reason that nobody built any dikes before, but it escapes her for now. She moves away a little from the work crews and the staring tourists. Since the last time she was here, a path has been beaten out besides the water, and small groups of hikers are coming and going.\nShe walks up to one of them, his high-end hiking gear mud-spattered and sun-bleached. Clothes aren\u2019t getting made as much as before, and cash to pay for them is hard to come by.\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m Gouda Smid, private detective. Have you walked the whole Circle?\u201d\nThe hiker turns to her, smiling, crow-footed blue eyes in a tan face. \u201cI do a half-circle every season. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI look for missing persons, mostly. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen on TV that they\u2019re mostly from towns along the Edge. Have you ever spotted anything odd or different?\u201d\nHe gazes away over the choppy water of the Hollands Diep. \u201cYes and no. I never see anything funny. It\u2019s more the things I don\u2019t see that make me wonder.\u201d\nThis is more interesting than Gouda was expecting from a routine chat. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cThe Netherlands have very few terminal stations, yet all around Circle Bay we have track railway lines ending at the edge of the water. Same with highways. Why build an eight-lane highway to a tiny little town at the edge of the water?\u201d\nGouda thinks she\u2019s maybe been watching the wrong shows. This sounds like National Geographic or History Channel material. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d\nHis mouth quirks into something less pleasant. \u201cI used to be a city planner.\u201d\n\u201cYou used to be? For what city?\u201d\n\u201cGood question. I can\u2019t remember. Or I never had a job, in spite of my training and advanced age.\u201d\nHe nods at her and walks on. He looks a lean and smart late thirties, not the kind of guy who\u2019s been out of a job since college.\nGouda runs after him and gives him her phone number. \u201cCall me sometime? I\u2019m wondering what this has to do with my missing persons cases. Things just don\u2019t add up.\u201d\nThe man doesn\u2019t commit but tucks her card away in one of his many zippered pockets.\nGouda sits down on a stray bollard, overlooking a paved square with faint markings indicating this was once a parking spot. She does have memories of cars, traffic jams, parking lots. But they are hard to match with this empty lot, which could have housed like sixty cars or more. There are still old cars running, of course, the ones without\u2014her thoughts stutter. She takes out her notebook and writes the stutter moment down. It\u2019s nearly full. She leafs through it. On the pages are words like \u201cNetflix\u201d\u2014she found that one in an old calendar. \u201cChips\u201d\u2014those taste great, but can also cause prolonged stuttering, seizures, and even comas.\nParking lots, she writes down. Why do old cars still run? They still run because\u2014and maybe because writing down the words make the stutter worse, she watches her hands flutter and clench over the notebook. The pencil breaks. The sun shines down on her face.\nShe closes her eyes and across the redness she sees icebergs floating past, tugged by boats. Icebergs are something polar. The polar ice is melting. Was melting. Is it still?\nShe opens her eyes and finds herself supine on pitted asphalt. The paving is warm because it\u2019s a sunny day, so she\u2019s not that uncomfortable. But her knuckles are grazed and her tailbone aches. She clambers back up, groaning from more aches and stings. A notebook is lying on the ground. She picks it up, and her name is on it. That\u2019s weird.\nShe browses the notebook, and it\u2019s full of incomprehensible notes. Bring it or toss it? No, it\u2019s hers; she must bring it, even though there\u2019s something repulsive about it.\nWhen Gouda gets home and wants to put the notebook away for later perusal, she discovers she has several more of those she\u2019d completely forgotten about. On her computer there\u2019s even a mind map of all the words, complete with date. Just to be sure, she finds the last entry in the found notebook, which has no date, and puts today\u2019s in.\nBut it\u2019s disturbing, all the same. What other work has she done she has forgotten about? Her eye finds a full noticeboard on the wall. It looks like a serial killer\u2019s wish list, complete with red cord and pins. But it\u2019s not about serial killing; it\u2019s full of clippings from magazines and newspapers, photos and yellow Post-its.\nShe reads one. \u201cWhere did the ice asteroids go? Recent astronomical data compared with centuries-old maps indicate that the asteroid belt and the moons of Jupiter have gaps in them that can\u2019t be explained. It\u2019s mostly ice planets, although heavy metals are also showing peculiar missings. On par with the vanished satellites.\u201d\nMissing ice planets. Missing people. Floating icebergs in her dream. No such thing as a coincidence someone once said, although Gouda is no longer surprised that she can\u2019t remember who.\nShe needs a dictionary. What\u2019s a satellite? But while she has many letters of the alphabet in both Dutch and English encyclopedias, yellow, moldering volumes, she doesn\u2019t have the Oxford English Dictionary\u2019s Rob-Sequyle. To the library it is. The last time she was there the library had become dusty and abandoned, with only a few rejected books on the sagging shelves. But encyclopedias are heavy and she\u2019s almost sure she saw a few.\nShe unlocks her bicycle and starts cycling the short distance to the library. The building still retains some licks of its once colorful paint, but the lower floor has had to be abandoned due to the rising water. But it\u2019s lit up, the door opens, and she hears the buzz of many people present and talking. It\u2019s a wonderful sound, bringing back memories that never really surface, but create ripples of their impending arrival in her mind. Better than nothing.\nShe walks into the big central space. It\u2019s indeed full of people sitting at desks, writing and doing work-like things. She steps close to one of the workers, an elderly lady, and sees she\u2019s writing a lined index card.\nThe activity suddenly makes sense. They\u2019re re-cataloging the library! By hand, because the computer systems were all lost. There\u2019s someone bent over an enormous machine she doesn\u2019t know the function of, a bit like a microscope but not quite. And so many books have returned! Hundreds line the shelves; more are stacked on carts sitting beside the cataloguers.\nThe sight fills Gouda with joy. Humanity is fighting back against missing persons, misfortune, and climate ravagery, one book at a time. She even sees a new-looking book. She picks it up. A strong odor emanates from it, chemical and strong, but satisfying. The scent of a newly printed book. The pages are crisp, the type a bit smudged but strongly black. A new book. Someone has found an old mechanical printing press.\nShe asks for directions to the encyclopedias and is given stern warning not to take any volumes home. She offers to bring the ones she has at home. It wouldn\u2019t be right to hoard that knowledge for herself alone.\nShe lugs the heavy dictionary volume, dated 1998, and leafs through the heavy pages. There it is. Satellite: natural object (moon) or spacecraft (artificial satellite) orbiting a larger astronomical body. Most known natural satellites orbit planets; the Earth\u2019s Moon is the most obvious example. Artificial satellites can be either unmanned (robotic) or manned . . .\nThe words \u201ccommunication\u201d and \u201cspace shuttle\u201d hurt her brain. She looks away quickly, leery of the buzzing sensation in her head, like a sinus headache. She wants to transcribe this important information, but she\u2019s afraid that if she reads them again, the sentences will start up that painful buzz or worse.\nShe tricks her brain by copying the article out starting at the bottom, with the last word in the last sentence. This way no meaning forms in her head and it\u2019s even possible to write whole words. As a last resort she would have written the words out letter by letter, starting with the last letter of a word and ending with the first, but that doesn\u2019t seem necessary.\nShould she share this trick with the librarians? She decides not to. They are happy, having found a way to rebuild some of the knowledge lost in the computer crash. They don\u2019t need to find out, like her, that some knowledge is painful, and some of it can\u2019t be retained.\nAs Gouda exits the library she walks past a blocky machine that triggers a faint memory. It\u2019s a copier. She\u2019s used them in high school. Maybe it still works. Yes, the electricity is on and it hums. She puts her notebook facedown on the lit plate\u2014funny how she remembered how to do that\u2014and presses the copy button. The copy slides out. Wow, they even had some blank paper left.\nShe lifts the paper to her face and smells. She closes her eyes. Memories rise, but they seem a bit stale and flat. There is no clue there. Why? The machine looks old and scuffed, its beige plastic brittle and discolored. Maybe this technology is too old to have meaning for her quest.\nShe pockets the page and heads home. She\u2019s no closer to solving her mystery, but her heart is lighter. Life will get better again, it just needs cooperation and dedication. She could be part of the library renewal if she wanted. Maybe it would be more rewarding than looking for people that have never been found yet.\nWhen she opens her door and climbs the four sets of stairs to her small apartment, a ringing sound shreds the air. Only when she sees the squat gray object emitting the sounds, she remembers it\u2019s a phone. Which can be answered. She picks up the horn-shaped object, hesitant about what to do. It\u2019s been so long.\n\u201cHi, is this Gouda?\u201d A male voice says. \u201cIt\u2019s Joe from Pynacker? I\u2019m in town. I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d\nGouda doesn\u2019t remember any Joe from Pynacker. Has she even ever been there? Her left hand fishes up train ticket stubs that, strangely enough, all appear to be to and from Pynacker. One of them is from yesterday.\nThe idea she went somewhere yesterday and doesn\u2019t remember it gives her such a weird feeling. She looks around the living room. Everything seems to be the same as before, no gray spots. If she went to Pynacker, it was for a reason, probably a case. She tells him where she lives.\nShe buzzes him in only ten minutes later. He\u2019s a tall guy in his early forties with a weather-beaten face and sun-bleached hair.\n\u201cHi Gouda,\u201d he says. \u201cNice to meet you again.\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she says. \u201cJoe, right?\u201d\nHis gaze sharpens. \u201cYou forgot?\u201d\nShe holds up the ticket stubs. \u201cI guess I went to Pynacker yesterday, but I don\u2019t remember. There\u2019s a page in my notebook as well. This has never happened to me before.\u201d\nJoe spots the kitchen and zooms in on the teapot. \u201cMint? Can I have a cup? I miss coffee, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve read about it,\u201d Gouda answers.\nSlurping his tea, Joe peruses her wall of clippings and pictures and pins. \u201cI see you\u2019ve found many of things I have. Satellites, huh? I\u2019ve been zooming in on things we used to eat and drink but no longer do, because we flew them in on planes.\u201d He taps a picture of a plane for emphasis. Or maybe he just wants to make sure Gouda knows what a plane is. \u201cCoffee, bananas, spices. I wonder if someone in a faraway country is trying to reorganize shipping those things. They must be in as bad an economic slump as we are.\u201d\nHe sits down at her table and gestures her over to him. Gouda\u2019s almost irked by his casual possession of her space, but decides to let it go. She gets another mug of tea and sits down next to him.\nHe rolls up his sleeves. His forearms are surprisingly smooth and creamy pale, years younger than his weatherworn face. Gouda blushes and finds it hard to lift her eyes from those strong, muscled arms. There\u2019s nobody in her life right now. Has there ever been?\nHe\u2019s speaking and she\u2019s missed the start. She takes a quick look at his face, which hasn\u2019t changed, so he hasn\u2019t noticed her moment of confusion. A sip of tea helps her get back to normal.\nInstead she sneezes. It takes her by surprise.\nJoe frowns. \u201cExactly. Humanity has a virus. We\u2019re all infected. We can\u2019t even . . . \u201d His eyes glaze, he starts to stutter.\nGouda watches with inexplicable dread. Something awful is going to happen. The light outside seems to darken, the room shrinks inward as the moment hangs in the air, pregnant with horror. But Joe draws his hands over his eyes, looks aside, shakes his head.\nThe moment is gone. The sun is still shining. But Gouda\u2019s heart still races, evidence that something almost happened.\n\u201cWhat happened? What did you just . . . ?\u201d Gouda doesn\u2019t dare be more specific, for fear of calling back the awful dread.\nJoe\u2019s eyes roll up and aside, searching for an innocuous answer. \u201cYou have to approach the square through a side street, not full on. And if you accidentally luck onto a big thoroughfare, distract yourself by thinking of trees or scoot into an alley. Right?\u201d\nGouda nods and jots down a quick note. She needs to remember this moment. It will help her with her case. She can\u2019t quite remember what it was about, only that\u2019s it\u2019s important.\nJoe clears his throat. \u201cIt seems to me that there are strangers in town. And that at night, they demolish houses and break up streets, so that we can\u2019t find our way home the next day. They are raiding our larder.\u201d\nGouda leans forward. \u201cThey like ice cream.\u201d Icebergs. \u201cAnd the people living in those broken-up streets forget their names and where they lived\u2014\u201d\nShe chokes up. Too close. Across the table, Joe\u2019s face turns purple and he makes hacking, desperate sounds. Their hands meet and she clutches his for one long moment, callused palm, warm fingers, blood rushing to meet hers.\nGouda blinks and starts at the stranger sitting at her coffee table. Her left hand has pale stripes over the back, as if someone just gripped her hand hard. As she watches, they fill with blood and disappear. As if it never happened.\nThe stranger stands up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss, um, I have to go.\u201d He looks around wildly, as if he doesn\u2019t remember what he\u2019s doing here either.\nGouda gets up to escort him to the door. There\u2019s a strange backpack in the hallway. She gestures at it. \u201cThis must be yours.\u201d\nHe hesitates. \u201cAre you sure? I don\u2019t know . . . \u201d\nShe hands it to him, firmly. \u201cI\u2019m sure. It\u2019s not mine.\u201d\n\u201cOkay. Thank you. Goodbye.\u201d\nHe hesitates in the door opening as if there\u2019s more to say, but there isn\u2019t. Gouda shuts the door behind him and waits until she hears him clomping down the stairs.\nShe returns to the table and her mug of peppermint tea. There\u2019s an open notebook on the table. \u201cDon\u2019t look into the sun,\u201d someone has written down in her handwriting.\nAs if anyone would.\nShe looks out of the window and watches a stranger with the flapping coat and the sun-bleached hair walk away. It fills her with inexplicable sadness.\nBo Balder lives and works close to Amsterdam. Bo is the first Dutch author to have been published in F&SF, Clarkesworld, Analog, and other places. Her sf novel The Wan was published by Pink Narcissus Press. When not writing, she knits, reads and gardens, preferably all three at the same time."}

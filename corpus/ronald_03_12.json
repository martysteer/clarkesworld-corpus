I was working in the far side of the complex, which meant I was one of about four hundred people who got to see the entire dome rise up off its foundations, rotate counterclockwise ninety degrees, and shoot up into the sky. My immediate reaction followed the same pattern as everyone else: first What the hell, then, just before a needle of light vaporized the biolab, Are those people up there?\n I could hazard a guess at the second question; I\u2019d gotten that far into the shadow organizations, even then. I knew enough to guess at the identities of some of the blurry shapes darting through the smoke, shapes that official press releases would call confabulation and that the conspiracists would call aliens or Muslims or Freemason-built androids. The shadow orgs had been sloppy that time; usually they didn\u2019t like to be seen at their work, but there\u2019d been so little warning that they\u2019d had no choice but to break out the big guns. Literally, in this case.\n But that wasn\u2019t what came to mind as I stared up into the sky, the glare of that solar blast fading bit by bit from my retinas, my nethead links relating the intensity of that blast, the projected knock-on effects on the rest of the Niobe web, the first stirrings among the dataminers. Instead, I just thought Casey would love this. I kept coming back to that thought over the next few weeks, even after word got out about the low-rent terrorists who\u2019d gotten so close to taking over the biolab that vaporizing the whole place was the only alternative. Even after the arrests started.\n I still think it\u2019s true.\n Today marks the first time I\u2019ve been allowed into the Albuquerque facility. My credentials have been checked and re-checked so many times that they could probably tell you the weight and density of my last three bowel movements. Even so, they\u2019ve been cutting corners on security, just so they can get me in here.\n I fully expect that within twenty years, someone will have figured out a way to install nethead technology in anyone regardless of individual brain structure. But until they do, I\u2019m pretty much guaranteed work wherever I go. And there\u2019s even fewer of us netheads with the proper security clearances to get into the Madison facility, let alone Albuquerque. I\u2019m a valuable commodity.\n The facility isn\u2019t much to look at: any decent biolab would have more apparent security. My nethead links are telling me otherwise, though; streams and warnings buzz against my skull so hard I can almost feel my teeth rattle. It unnerves me in a way that Madison didn\u2019t, and Madison\u2019s where they keep the host site for the Niobe satellite web. Enough solar power to\u2014well, to blow up a biolab, for instance\u2014focused onto the energy collectors for five dozen countries, and it\u2019s still less well protected than this place.\n It\u2019s cool and dark inside the guard shack, and the back of my neck prickles after the blazing heat outside. The guard\u2019s got a laser sight wired into his left eye; the silver tracery of it fades into his pale complexion much more smoothly than the similar patterns on my own skin. He gestures to the marks while the machines verify my ID. \u201cLooks nice.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d It\u2019s striking, or so the nethead PR department says. They claim that\u2019s why they want my image for their publicity stills, not just to provide the illusion of diversity. Some days I think they even believe it.\n \u201cBeen here before?\u201d The guard knows I haven\u2019t\u2014a glance at the screens could tell him as much and more\u2014but sometimes courtesy trumps efficiency.\n I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019ve been to Madison.\u201d\n \u201cMadison, pfft.\u201d He grins. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to what we got\u2014\u201d He stops and turns red, as if he can\u2019t quite believe what he\u2019s saying. I used to have that reaction, way back when I was sharing what I knew with Casey, when I tried to tell her that the comics we\u2019d read were\u2014well, not true, not close to true, but had some basis in reality.\n \u201cGot what?\u201d I ask, as the computers spit out my ID and agree that yes, my fingers and retinas appear to be my own.\n \u201cWell, you know. Them.\u201d He opens up the doors, and the flickering readouts in my periphery flare and scramble into new configurations. \u201cThe heroes.\u201d\n The official story of Casey and me is that we were kids together, grew apart, came back together, screwed around, and then split up for good once I realized how crazy she was. Both times it was the heroes that brought us together, the first time through the comics that had come out in the wake of Maxentius sightings and the rumors about the Sixth Seal group. We read them all, regardless of quality, lying on our backs in the vacant lot behind her house, ink on our fingers and intent discussions of whether Mistress Fivepoint could beat Jack o\u2019the Green or if they\u2019d just team up against Memetek. The second time it was because in my first months as a full nethead I learned so much about the shadow organizations, the reality behind all those rumors, and I could only think of one person I wanted to share that with\u2014Casey, who could rattle off the Liberty League\u2019s oath or Red Knight\u2019s transformation mantra as easily as the Pledge of Allegiance.\n Both times it was her head, or what was wrong with it, that split us up.\n It\u2019s a useful official version. But one thing you learn when you start getting involved in the shadow orgs is that the official version means very little. After all, none of them show up in any official version, except in the records of what didn\u2019t happen, the plots that failed, the disasters averted.\n Or, sometimes, in the lists of people who\u2019ve disappeared.\n The transport behind those metal doors takes me maybe eight floors down, with that bone-twitching stutter you only get from passing through negation fields. I don\u2019t notice it; I\u2019m too busy dealing with the sudden silence in my head. I can handle it\u2014mental stability is one of the most important factors that they test for in determining nethead fitness\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean I enjoy it. Particularly because the one link that does remain is the one that got implanted when I started working for the shadow orgs. For insurance, they told me. The Niobe GPS link.\n I remember the Fourth Street biolab, and the back of my neck goes abruptly hot again.\n When the doors open again, though, all thoughts of the world outside vanish. The visual input\u2019s bad enough: between the scream of light on my right from what might be a laboratory and the dizzying drop twenty feet ahead of me, I can barely register mundane details like the polished-glass sheen of the floor, the central spindle of memory staves, the man waiting for me just to the side.\n But all that\u2019s nothing compared to the chatter of computers on every side, the information in patterns I\u2019ve never seen before. It\u2019s like being picked up from one set of rapids and dropped into another, and it takes all of my concentration not to drown.\n The biggest difference is that there\u2019s not much trace of nethead work. It\u2019s tradition to leave our marks on the usernodes, stegans encoded into the streams of data like graffiti in a canal, but here there\u2019s only two: Klaatu Barada Nikto! from the designer of the Niobe web, and Welcome to Olympus (plus a handy map) from a woman who\u2019s now on permanent detail with the Secret Service. If this were a normal job, I\u2019d be tempted to add my own mark to the tabulae, but right now I don\u2019t trust what I\u2019d leave.\n A permanent link unscrolls with the boxy look of official work. IN RESIDENCE: Kazemusha/Lady Nettle/Oculus/Matthew Glendower/Maxentius . . . The list goes on, code names and real names (not that it matters which is which, this far in) and designations I\u2019ve only seen in the most hidden records. Names to conjure with.\n And finally I recognize the man who\u2019s been standing just to the side of the entrance. They\u2019ve sent the shining face of the org to meet me.\n He\u2019s just like Casey and I always imagined, resplendent in ivory and gold, and while he doesn\u2019t have the red cape the comics gave him, I get the sense he\u2019d like one. Barrel chest, brilliant smile, voice with enough bonhomie for a tri-state area. \u201cBit overwhelming, eh?\u201d Maxentius says.\n \u201cA bit,\u201d I agree weakly.\n \u201cIt does that to me too, sometimes.\u201d No it doesn\u2019t, I think, but he\u2019s not talking about the information overload. He gestures to the vista behind him: dozens of circular floors leading off a central shaft, lifts and elevators between for those who can\u2019t just fly. \u201cThis sight\u2014when I tire of it, then I\u2019ll know the skein of my days has run out. Good to meet you, Seth.\u201d He clasps my hand and shakes it vigorously.\n \u201cGood to meet you.\u201d I\u2019ve read papers on how much force that hand can exert, how many diamonds it can crush into powder.\n \u201cAnd you\u2019re here to see Glendower. Splendid.\u201d He turns and strides forward across the gleaming floor. I follow, and if it looks like I\u2019m not gawking, that\u2019s because I\u2019m only doing so in my head. Of the levels I can see, some are sterile white and glassed in; some hold weapons and implements I can only guess at; a few look inhabited, homes for those who can\u2019t or won\u2019t stay outside in the world they claim to protect. A blur on the next floor up, across from us, resolves into a sparring match between two figures I\u2019ve only heard rumors of, and even then I have to slow the visual down by a factor of ten to get a glimpse.\n At the far end of the walkway, Maxentius glances over his shoulder. \u201cCome along, lad! Mustn\u2019t keep him waiting!\u201d\n Of all the members of the shadow organizations, Maxentius has read too much of his own press. He really does talk like a comic book; \u2018lad\u2019 is nothing to worry about.\n Still, it bothers me, and not just because I can remember one too many cops calling my father \u2018boy\u2019 on one too many late-night drives.\n There are some things I know for sure about Casey: she loved superhero comics; she didn\u2019t keep in touch with her family after graduating; she wrote pamphlets for the Oakland Anti-Gnosis society; she couldn\u2019t keep a job for more than six months at a time; she could make fantastic biscuits out of damn near any ingredients she had at hand. When her parents moved away the first time, when we were in school, it was because the first round of mandatory testing had come through. I was on the track to being a fully-functional nethead; Casey had tested positive for a number of dysfunctions, including predisposition to schizophrenia.\n There are things I wonder about\u2014whether the chemical imbalances in her brain were caused by her father\u2019s exposure to some of the nastier weapons of the Second Chinese War, whether she knew what a risk I was taking associating with her, whether we should have gone ahead and slept together after all.\n There are things I\u2019ve been told about her in the wake of Fourth Street, about her mental state and the company she kept. These are things I will never believe about her.\n Maxentius leads me around one side of the silo shaft, through what looks like a trophy room (it\u2019s not, according to the nethead stegans). He\u2019s rapidly figured out that I\u2019m not listening to him, but that doesn\u2019t stop him; in fact, I think he\u2019s taken it as license to ramble on.\n I catch a glimpse of someone I think is Pale Rider down one hallway. If it is him, that means this particular shadow organization has gone global. Most of them have; a few nationalists cling to their identity in places like Turkmenistan and France, and somehow I\u2019d always assumed the U.S. shadow orgs would be the same way.\n Of course, they have the Niobe web. That automatically makes them global; I\u2019ve got the reminder in my skull if I ever forget that.\n We walk past cases holding remnants of past work, plots unraveled, events that were hushed up and now only remain as a footnote to history. Still talking, Maxentius gestures vaguely at what looks like a giant pair of shears. \u201c . . . didn\u2019t tell us that the phase shift had affected only half of her, and the other half was stuck in another dimension entirely!\u201d He chuckles, and I remember to smile. \u201cDown this way. Glendower, are you there?\u201d\n A gray-haired man in a white shirt and bow tie\u2014there\u2019s even a tweed jacket, the kind with the elbow patches, tossed over a chair\u2014waves back without looking. He\u2019s talking to a woman I don\u2019t recognize. I wouldn\u2019t know her if we met on the street; I\u2019d only know her if she wore her mask. She folds up her clipboard, nods to Maxentius, and fades into invisibility with a faint scent of calla lilies.\n Glendower\u2019s in his late fifties but looks older. He walks with a cane, and while he doesn\u2019t have the same build as Maxentius, he\u2019s not a small man either. His gray hair is still thick, but there are autofocusing spectacles perched on his nose, and when he pulls a chair over and sinks into it, it\u2019s clear that standing for so long was a strain for him. He\u2019s the one who pushed through my security clearance, since the virus affected the orgs\u2019 datalogs and he\u2019s the one who has to work with them. Bookkeeper to the gods. \u201cWell, Mr. Carson, what do you think of our little home?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d I say, truthfully, and then a touch of the perverse prompts me to add, \u201cif a little rough on visitors.\u201d\n To my surprise, it\u2019s not Glendower who answers, but Maxentius. \u201cThe price of our work,\u201d he says with a regretful sigh. Maxentius doesn\u2019t hide his feelings much; the man\u2019s all surface, glossy and deep as a four-color page spread. \u201cThese days, to defend the innocent requires one to have a home of which all are innocent.\u201d He sees my expression and shakes his head. \u201cI assure you, lad, we\u2019re all on the same side here. We are protectors of the world we love, sworn to defend it.\u201d\n He\u2019s entirely serious, and of all the members of the shadow orgs, he embodies those values the most. And yet I can\u2019t help myself. \u201c\u2019To protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenseless from the indignities, wrongs and outrages of the lawless, the violent and the brutal,\u2019\u201d I quote. Glendower shoots me a sharp look.\n Maxentius, though, hasn\u2019t noticed. \u201cYes! Exactly.\u201d He shakes my hand a second time, beaming, and nods to Glendower. \u201cI must be off. Good luck\u2014I hope we\u2019ll see you here again.\u201d\n I watch him go. He rescues kittens; that much is a matter of record. It\u2019s part of why there\u2019s now a cleanup detail assigned solely to him. The shadow orgs may prize their secrecy, but Maxentius does make a useful distraction. And, after all, they are all on the same side.\n I shouldn\u2019t have made fun of him. It\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s an innocent.\n Glendower\u2019s watching me, but unless he\u2019s a nethead\u2014and I know he\u2019s not\u2014he can\u2019t see everything I\u2019m doing. \u201cI\u2019ve set up a contact terminal for you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d been meaning to change out our security, but good netheads with clearance are few and far between, and I\u2019m afraid we were caught with our trousers down. The virus doesn\u2019t seem to be actively hostile, but my projections show it stopping work outright if it overloads any more of our systems. At the moment it\u2019s benign, just irritating.\u201d\n \u201cI can imagine.\u201d Twenty years ago, we\u2019d have been fine with a microsecond lag; forty years, and a five-second lag was nothing. But technology spoils us\u2014I should know, I\u2019ve got a few dozen terabytes\u2019 worth of it in my head. I switch from wireless to node work, and put my hands on either side of the contact terminal, relying on the points wired into my fingertips to carry me in. \u201cI can upgrade some of your security while I\u2019m here, but it\u2019ll just be a patch-up job till I can come back, and I don\u2019t yet have clearance for a second visit. You sure you couldn\u2019t fix it yourself?\u201d\n Glendower shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s rapidshift. I just don\u2019t have the speed to keep it from mutating as I\u2019m working on it. That\u2019s nethead work.\u201d\n Of course it is; I created the damn virus. My consciousness is already split between the terminals that dot the base; I damp wireless input to make up for it and start searching.\n Glendower waits for a response from me, then shakes his head and laboriously gets up from the chair. He\u2019s got a pacemaker; I can sense the pulse of it like a cricket in the room. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to have a nethead down here,\u201d he says, opening a cabinet and pouring a glass of tonic water. \u201cI had to argue just to get the first few working on our security.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got failsafes in place, though.\u201d Those failsafes gave me nightmares for weeks, after I first found out that the Niobe web wasn\u2019t just for solar energy.\n \u201cTrue.\u201d He pours a second glass and sets it on the shelf next to me. I nod my thanks but don\u2019t take it. We\u2019re both silent a moment; realtime maybe ten seconds, wiretime much longer, long enough for me to cordon off my virus and distinguish the main archives from what I\u2019m looking for. They don\u2019t let these out to the general public; they don\u2019t even have access through the Madison facility. The Oculus records.\n \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to tease Max like that,\u201d Glendower says quietly.\n \u201cProbably not.\u201d I\u2019m sorting through records, searching by time, date, subject, even setting aside a part of my brain to flash through random stills, looking for Casey. Oculus\u2019 uploads take up entire spindles; I\u2019ve heard that no one knows why it records everything it sees, but they don\u2019t want to upset it by asking. \u201cIt just bothered me.\u201d\n \u201cWhen he finds out you quoted the mission statement of the Klan at him, he\u2019ll be a mess. Max doesn\u2019t work well when he has a crisis of conscience.\u201d He settles back into his chair with a grunt, and tonic water splashes over the back of his hand.\n \u201cThen he\u2019ll only be saving the world eighty percent of the time. I\u2019m sure the rest of you can cover the remaining twenty percent.\u201d Something about the virus cordon is bothering me, but I\u2019m so close\u2014and there she is, Casey\u2019s face blurring by, the brief video record categorized with about four hundred others, each no more than a couple of minutes.\n \u201cWould you be willing to help out with that twenty percent?\u201d\n I stop, sliding Casey\u2019s record into my personal memory like a shoplifter sliding a necklace into his pocket, and turn to face him, keeping one hand on the contact terminal. \u201cSorry?\u201d\n Glendower smiles and thumps his cane on the floor. He needs that cane, I know; an accident when this place was being built wrecked his right foot, and he hasn\u2019t had it replaced. \u201cIf nothing else, this incident highlights our need to have a nethead on the team. You\u2019re the best, you\u2019ve got the offline intelligence we need, and you\u2019ve shown great discretion in your work for us here and in Madison.\u201d\n Discretion. Right. Which is why I\u2019m now fixing a problem I created. It\u2019s tempting, though\u2014I can imagine Casey saying Who wouldn\u2019t jump at a chance to be a superhero? Or is it only that I want her to say that?\n I unpack Casey\u2019s record for later viewing, thinking of the smell of hot dirt in the vacant lot and four-color ink smudged across my fingers. \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d\n \u201cWell.\u201d Glendower sighs, then leans over and sets his glass down on the far terminal. \u201cI understand, you\u2019ve got doubts. After all\u2014\u201d the screen behind him lights up, \u201c\u2014I think I know why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n Casey stares down at me from Glendower\u2019s screen, twenty times larger than life, and I finally recognize what the virus report is telling me: someone, probably Glendower himself, got to it first. I stare at Casey\u2019s image on the screens\u2014an ID photo, not a mug shot. They\u2019d only had mug shots for the ones who\u2019d gotten arrested, and Casey didn\u2019t even make it that far.\n Glendower nods. \u201cShe was important to you.\u201d\n \u201cShe was.\u201d I open the video record that I went through so much to find. It\u2019s only about twenty seconds\u2019 worth of Oculus\u2019 point-of-view, showing a door bursting open. Casey crouches at the far end of the room, frizzy hair tied up in a bright red cloth, eyes wide and dark.\n She\u2019s just as I remember her.\n The record shows her turning and reaching for something\u2014a gun? a phone? a vial that could be her medicine and could be something else entirely? All of them are on the same table. She never even touches it before a flash of light from the door cuts her down.\n I close my eyes, then open them to face Glendower, and behind him, Casey. \u201cYou knew?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re everywhere, Mr. Carson. We knew.\u201d He looks over his shoulder, at the image of a smiling dead girl. \u201cShe\u2019d been part of the Fourth Street terrorist cell. We got to the lab first, but when we came to apprehend her\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I can see what happened. I take another look back into the Oculus records; someone\u2019s lumped all of the recorded deaths together, whether criminal or civilian or just plain dumb luck. Glendower\u2019s assembled them for his own penance, I guess. He doesn\u2019t let himself forget either.\n It\u2019s not enough.\n \u201cMy offer still stands.\u201d He props his hands on his cane and gazes at me. Casey does the same, over his shoulder. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first to forsake vengeance and turn your considerable talents toward a good cause. Or\u2014\u201d he sits back a little \u201c\u2014you can take that vengeance on me. I won\u2019t stop you.\u201d\n My breathing slows, and the hand that isn\u2019t on the terminal curls into a fist. I could do it. I could kill him in any number of ways\u2014stop the pulse of his pacemaker, use the autofocus in his spectacles as a link into his optical nerve and burn his skull from the inside out, scramble his neurons till he\u2019s a drooling vegetable\u2014and walk away. I might even get out of here unscathed, depending how what method I chose.\n But kill him, and there\u2019ll be another just as certain that they\u2019re justified in their actions. Because it\u2019s their job to save the world. They\u2019re everywhere already, and so many of them wear masks. They say it\u2019s to protect their identities, but it\u2019s also so that we\u2019re never sure who\u2019s one of them, who\u2019s watching. They\u2019re always anonymous again in daylight.\n Who was that masked man? I don\u2019t know, but there\u2019s twenty more of them outside.\n Or join them. That\u2019s the logical ending for a nethead; most of us find one big project and stick with it, and this would be in a good cause. If the terrorists had gotten their hands on the Fourth Street biolab, the result could have killed thousands. How many lives could I save that way, how many Caseys could I save . . .\n I snip the virus out of the system with an absent thought and take my hands from the terminal, switching back to wireless. \u201cLet me think about it,\u201d I say again, and this time I\u2019m not stalling, I\u2019m pleading.\n Glendower nods. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, bowing his head. \u201cAbout your friend\u2019s death\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n And that decides it. Not I\u2019m sorry we killed her, but I\u2019m sorry about her death. Sidestepping the responsibility. Making it an act of God.\n I take a few steps toward the exit, hesitant and unsteady. It\u2019s not acting; I have to retract some of my motor skills to handle the download, the massive quantity of Oculus records pouring into my head. But Glendower sees it as the agony of indecision, and he lets me pass. He\u2019s a good man; he wouldn\u2019t deliberately hurt someone like me.\n I find my way to the exit unhindered\u2014I think Maxentius, or maybe one of his cleanup crew, waves to me as I go by. As the doors close, I wonder with the portion of my brain that isn\u2019t unpacking records if I\u2019ll make it out of here at all. If the shadow orgs wanted, they could kill me right here, and I couldn\u2019t do a thing about it.\n But these are the good guys.\n In the silence of the transport I have time to craft the message that will go out with each clip. It\u2019s not much, just a few lines for each record, an autovoice that\u2019s recognizably my own. And links, archives, paths to data that isn\u2019t shared or acknowledged, not even by netheads. Even crafting this, having a message like this unsent in my skull, is punishable by federal law.\n The guard waves me through, and I step out into blinding sunlight. The world of data flows around me again\u2014and this time I leap into it, sending out into all nodes, the conspiracists and the news media and the archives. The Niobe GPS activates, and above me the satellite web moves, shifts, focuses.\n It\u2019s not enough to stop me.\n These people have died because of the shadow organizations, I say over each clip, each death, each victim of the shadow orgs. The desert sunlight shifts, shading from yellow-white to blazing, bright enough to hurt my eyes. They were deemed guilty and executed without trial. The guard is yelling, first running after me and then, as he realizes what\u2019s happening, back to the shade and safety of his bunker.\n They were unlawfully executed. And links, lists, the shadow orgs and all their work, thrown open to the world they claim to protect. If they can\u2019t take the scrutiny, they don\u2019t deserve to last.\n I turn my face to the incandescent sky and smile, racing to meet the sunlight."}

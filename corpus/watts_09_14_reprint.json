He\u2019s dead to human eyes. Even the machines barely see the chemistry ticking over in those cells: an ancient molecule of hydrogen sulphide, frozen in a hemoglobin embrace; an electron shuttled sluggishly down some metabolic pathway two weeks ago. Back on Earth there used to be life deep in the rocks, halfway to the mantle; empires rose and fell in the time it took those microbes to draw breath. Next to Hakim\u2019s, their lives blurred past in an eyeblink. (Next to all of ours. I was every bit as dead, just a week ago.)\n I\u2019m still not sure it\u2019s a good idea, bringing him back.\n Flat lines shiver in their endless march along the x-axis: molecules starting to bump against each other, core temp edging up a fraction of a fraction. A lonely spark flickers in the hypothalamus; another wriggles across the prefrontal cortex (a passing thought, millennia past its best-before, released from amber). Millivolts trickle down some random path and an eyelid twitches.\n The body shudders, tries to breathe but it\u2019s too soon: it\u2019s still anoxic in there, pure H2S gumming up the works and shutting the machinery of life down to a whisper. The Chimp starts a nitrox flush; swarms of fireflies bloom across Pulmonary and Vascular. Hakim\u2019s cold empty husk fills with light from the inside out: red and yellow isotherms, pulsing arteries, a trillion reawakening neurons stippling across the translucent avatar in my head. A real breath this time. Another. His fingers twitch and stutter, tap a random tattoo against the floor of his sarcophagus.\n The lid slides open. His eyes, too, a moment later: they roll unfocused in their sockets, suffused in a haze of resurrection dementia. He can\u2019t see me. He sees soft lights and vague shadows, hears the faint underwater echo of nearby machinery, but his mind is still stuck to the past and the present hasn\u2019t sunk in yet.\n A tongue dry as leather flicks into view against his upper lip. A drinking tube emerges from its burrow and nudges Hakim\u2019s cheek. His takes it in his mouth and nurses, reflexive as a newborn.\n I lean into what passes for his field of view: \u201cLazarus, come forth.\u201d\n It anchors him. I see sudden focus resolving in those eyes, see the past welling up behind them. I see memories and hearsay loading in the wake of my voice. Confusion evaporates; something sharper takes its place. Hakim stares up at me from the grave, his eyes hard as obsidian.\n \u201cYou asshole,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t believe we haven\u2019t killed you yet.\u201d\n I give him space. I retreat to the forest, wander endless twilit caverns while he learns to live again. Down here I can barely see my own hand in front of my face: gray fingers, faint sapphire accents. Photophores glimmer around me like dim constellations, each tiny star lit by the glow of a trillion microbes. Photosynthesis instead of fusion. You can\u2019t get truly lost in Eriophora\u2014the Chimp always knows where you are\u2014but here in the dark, there\u2019s comfort to be had in the illusion.\n Eventually, though, I have to stop stalling. I sample myriad feeds as I rise though the depths of the asteroid, find Hakim in the starboard bridge. I watch as he enters painstaking questions, processes answers, piles each new piece on top of the last in a rickety climb to insight. Lots of debris in this system, yes: more than enough material for a build. Call up the transponders and\u2014what\u2019s this? No in-system scaffolding, no half-constructed jump gate, no asteroid mining or factory fleet. So why\u2014?\n System dynamics, now. Lagrange points. Nothing on this side, anyway, even though there are at least three planetary bodies in\u2014whoa, those orbits\u2014\n Our orbit . . .\n By the time I join him in the flesh he\u2019s motionless, staring into the tac tank. A bright dimensionless point floats in the center of that display: Eriophora. The ice giant looms dark and massive to port, the red one\u2014orders of magnitude larger\u2014seethes in the distance behind. (If I stepped outside I\u2019d see an incandescent barrier stretching across half the universe, with the barest hint of a curve on the horizon; tac reduces it to a cherry globe floating in an aquarium.) A million bits of detritus, from planets to pebbles, careen through the neighborhood. We\u2019re not even relativistic and still the Chimp hasn\u2019t had time to tag them all.\n None of those tags make sense anyway. We\u2019re aeons from the nearest earthly constellation; every alphabet, every astronomical convention has been exhausted by the stars we\u2019ve passed in the meantime. Maybe the Chimp invented his own taxonomy while we were sleeping, some arcane gibberish of hex and ASCII that makes sense to him and him alone. A hobby, perhaps, although he\u2019s supposed to be too stupid for anything like that.\n I slept through most of that scenery. I\u2019ve been awake for barely a hundred builds; my mythological reservoir is nowhere near exhausted. I have my own names for these monsters.\n The cold giant is Thule. The hot one is Surtr.\n Hakim ignores my arrival. He moves sliders back and forth: trajectories extrude from bodies in motion, predict the future according to Newton. Eventually all those threads converge and he rewinds time, reverses entropy, reassembles the shattered teacup and sets it running again. He does it three times as I watch. The result never changes.\n He turns, his face bloodless. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit. We\u2019re going to ram straight into the fucking thing.\u201d\n I swallow and nod.\n \u201cThat\u2019s how it starts,\u201d I tell him.\n We\u2019re going to hit. We\u2019re aiming to hit, we\u2019re going to let the lesser monster devour us before the greater one devours it. We\u2019ll lower Eriophora by her own bootstraps, sink through roiling bands of hydrogen and helium and a thousand exotic hydrocarbons, down to whatever residual deep-space chill Thule\u2019s been hoarding since\u2014who knows? Maybe almost as long as we\u2019ve been in flight.\n It won\u2019t last, of course. The planet\u2019s been warming ever since it started its long fall from the long dark. Its bones will survive the passage through the stellar envelope easily enough: five hours in and out, give or take. Its atmosphere won\u2019t be so lucky, though. Every step of the way Surtr\u2019s going to be stripping it down like a child licking an ice cream cone.\n We\u2019ll make it through by balancing in the ever-shrinking sweet spot between a red-hot sky and the pressure cooker at Thule\u2019s core. The numbers say it\u2019ll work.\n Hakim should know this already. He would have awakened knowing if not for that idiotic uprising of theirs. But they chose to blind themselves instead, burn out their links, cut themselves off from the very heart of the mission. So now I have to explain things. I have to show things. All that instantaneous insight we once shared, gone: one ancient fit of pique and I have to use words, scribble out diagrams, etch out painstaking codes and tokens while the clock runs down. I\u2019d hoped that maybe, after all these red-shifted millennia, they might have reconsidered; but the look in Hakim\u2019s eyes leaves no doubt. As far as he\u2019s concerned it all happened yesterday.\n I do my best. I keep the conversation strictly professional, focus on the story so far: a build, aborted. Chaos and inertia, imminent annihilation, the insane counterintuitive necessity of passing through a star instead of going around it. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d Hakim asks once I\u2019ve finished.\n \u201cIt looked like a perfect spot.\u201d I gesture at the tank. \u201cFrom a distance. Chimp even sent out the vons, but\u2014\u201d I shrug. \u201cThe closer we got, the worse it turned out to be.\u201d\n He stares at me without speaking, so I add context: \u201cFar as we can tell something big came through a few hundred thousand years back, knocked everything haywire. None of the planetary masses are even on the ecliptic any more. We can\u2019t find anything orbiting with an eccentricity of less than point six, there\u2019s a shitload of rogues zipping around in the halo\u2014but by the time those numbers came back, we were already committed. So now we just buckle down through the heavy traffic, steal a gravity-assist, get back on the road.\u201d\n He shakes his head. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\n Oh, that\u2019s what he means. I tap an interface, timelapse the red giant. It jerks in the tank like a fibrillating heart. \u201cTurns out it\u2019s an irregular variable. One complication too many, right?\u201d Not that we\u2019ll be able thread the needle any better than the Chimp can (although of course Hakim\u2019s going to try, in these few hours left to him). But the mission has parameters. The Chimp has his algorithms. Too many unexpected variables and he wakes up the meat. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here for, after all.\n That\u2019s all we\u2019re here for.\n One more time, Hakim asks: \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\n Oh.\n \u201cYou\u2019re the numbers guy,\u201d I say after a moment. \u201cOne of \u2019em, anyway.\u201d Out of how many thousand, stored down in the crypt?\n Doesn\u2019t matter. They probably all know about me by now.\n \u201cGuess it was just your rotation,\u201d I add.\n He nods. \u201cAnd you? You a numbers guy too, now?\u201d\n \u201cWe come back in pairs,\u201d I say softly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n \u201cSo it just happened to be your rotation as well.\u201d\n \u201cLook\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNothing to do with your Chimp wanting its own personal sock-puppet on hand to keep an eye on things.\u201d\n \u201cFuck, Hakim, what do you want me to say?\u201d I spread my hands. \u201cThat he might want someone on deck who won\u2019t try to pull the plug the first chance they get? You think that\u2019s unreasonable, given what happened?\u201d But he doesn\u2019t even know what happened, not first-hand. Hakim wasn\u2019t up when the mutiny went down; someone obviously told him, down through the epochs. Christ knows how much of what he heard is truth, lies, legend.\n A few million years go by and suddenly I\u2019m the bogeyman.\n We fall towards ice. Ice falls towards fire. Both spill through the link and spread across the back of my skull in glorious terrifying first-person. Orders of magnitude aren\u2019t empty abstractions in here: they\u2019re life-size, you feel them in your gut. Surtr may be small to a textbook\u2014at seven million kilometers across, it\u2019s barely big enough to get into the giant\u2019s club\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean shit when you meet it face to face. That\u2019s not a star out there: that\u2019s the scorching edge of all creation, that\u2019s heat-death incarnate. Its breath stinks of left-over lithium from the worlds it\u2019s already devoured. And the dark blemish marching across its face isn\u2019t just a planet. It\u2019s a melting hellscape twice the size of Uranus, it\u2019s frozen methane and liquid hydrogen and a core hot and heavy enough to bake diamonds. Already it\u2019s coming apart before my eyes, any moons long since lost, the tattered remnants of a ring system shredding around it like a rotting halo. Storms boil across its face; aurorae flicker madly at both poles. A supercyclone pinwheels at the center of the dark side, fed by turbulent streamers fleeing from light into shadow. Its stares back at me like the eye of a blind god.\n Meanwhile, Hakim pushes balls around inside an aquarium.\n He\u2019s been at it for hours: a bright blue marble here, a sullen red basketball over there, threads of tinsel looping through time and trajectory like the webbing of some crazed spacefaring spider. Maybe pull our center of mass to starboard, start gentle then ramp up to max? Break some rocks on the way, suffer some structural damage but nothing the drones won\u2019t be able to patch up in time for the next build.\n No?\n Maybe cut smooth and fast into full reverse. Eri\u2019s not built for it but if we keep the vectors dead along the centerline, no turn no torque just a straight linear one-eighty back out the way we came\u2014\n But no.\n If only we hadn\u2019t already fallen so far down the well. If only we hadn\u2019t slowed down to open the trunk, all these N-bodies wouldn\u2019t have been able to get such a grip on us. But now we\u2019re only fast, not fast enough; we\u2019re big but still too small.\n Now, the only way out is through.\n Hakim\u2019s not an idiot. He knows the rules as well as I do. He keeps trying, though. He\u2019d rather rewrite the laws of physics than trust himself to the enemy. We\u2019ll be deaf and blind in there, after all; the convulsions of Thule\u2019s disintegrating atmosphere will fog our sight at short range, the roar of Surtr\u2019s magnetic field will deafen us in the long. There\u2019ll be no way of telling where we are, nothing but the Chimp\u2019s math to tell us where we should be.\n Hakim doesn\u2019t see the world like I do. He doesn\u2019t like having to take things on faith.\n Now he\u2019s getting desperate, blasting chunks off his toy asteroid in an attempt to reduce its momentum. He hasn\u2019t yet considered how that might impact our radiation shielding once we get back up to speed. He\u2019s still stuck on whether we can scavenge enough in-system debris to patch the holes on our way out.\n \u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d I tell him, though I\u2019m wandering deep in the catacombs half a kilometer from his location. (I\u2019m not spying because he knows I\u2019m watching. Of course he knows.)\n \u201cWon\u2019t it now.\u201d\n \u201cNot enough mass along the escape trajectory, even if the vons could grab it all and get it back in time.\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t know how much mass is out there. Haven\u2019t plotted it all yet.\u201d\n He\u2019s being deliberately obtuse, but I go along with it; at least we\u2019re talking. \u201cCome on. You don\u2019t need to plot every piece of gravel to get a mass distribution. It won\u2019t work. Check with the Chimp if you don\u2019t believe me. He\u2019ll tell you.\u201d\n \u201cIt just has told me,\u201d he says.\n I stop walking. I force myself to take a slow breath.\n \u201cI\u2019m linked, Hakim. Not possessed. It\u2019s just an interface.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a corpus callosum.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m just as autonomous as you are.\u201d\n \u201cDefine I.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u201cMinds are holograms. Split one in half, you get two. Stitch two together, you get one. Maybe you were human back before your upgrade. Right now you\u2019ve got about as much standalone soul as my parietal lobe.\u201d\n I look back along the vaulted corridor (I suppose the cathedral architecture might just be coincidence), where the dead sleep stacked on all sides.\n They\u2019re much better company like this.\n \u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d I ask them all, \u201cthen how did you ever get free?\u201d\n Hakim doesn\u2019t speak for a moment.\n \u201cThe day you figure that out,\u201d he says, \u201cis the day we lose the war.\u201d\n It\u2019s not a war. It\u2019s a fucking tantrum. They tried to derail the mission and the Chimp stopped them. Simple as that, and perfectly predictable. That\u2019s why the engineers made the Chimp so minimalist in the first place, why the mission isn\u2019t run by some transcendent AI with an eight-dimensional IQ: so that things will stay predictable. If my fellow meat sacks couldn\u2019t see it coming, they\u2019re more stupid than the thing they\u2019re fighting.\n Hakim knows that on some level, of course. He just refuses to believe it: that he and his buddies got outsmarted by something with half his synapse count. The Chimp. The idiot savant, the artificial stupidity. The number-cruncher explicitly designed to be so dim that even with half the lifespan of a universe to play around in, it could never develop its own agenda.\n They just can\u2019t believe it beat them in a fair fight.\n That\u2019s why they need me. I let them tell each other that it cheated. No way that glorified finger-counter would\u2019ve won if I hadn\u2019t betrayed my own kind.\n This is the nature of my betrayal; I stepped in to save their lives. Not that their lives were really in danger, of course, no matter what they say. It was just a strategy. That was predictable too.\n I\u2019m sure the Chimp would have turned the air back on before things went too far.\n Thule\u2019s graduated from world to wall while I wasn\u2019t looking: a dark churning expanse of thunderheads and planet-shredding tornadoes. There\u2019s no sign of Surtr lurking behind, not so much as a faint glow on the horizon. We huddle in the shadow of the lesser giant and it\u2019s almost as though the greater one has simply gone away.\n We\u2019re technically in the atmosphere now, a mountain wallowing high above the clouds with its nose to the stars. You could draw a line from the hot hydrogen slush of Thule\u2019s core through the cold small singularity of our own, straight out through the gaping conical maw at our bow. Hakim does just that, in the tac tank. Maybe it makes him feel a little more in control.\n Eriophora sticks out her tongue.\n You can only see it in X-ray or Hawking, maybe the slightest nimbus of gamma radiation if you tune the sensors just right. A tiny bridge opens at the back of Eri\u2019s mouth: a hole in spacetime reaching back to the hole in our heart. Our center of mass smears a little off-center, seeks some elastic equilibrium between those points. The Chimp nudges the far point farther and our center follows in its wake. The asteroid tugs upward, falling after itself; Thule pulls us back. We hang balanced in the sky while the wormhole\u2019s tip edges past the crust, past that abraded mouth of blue-sanded basalt, out past the forward sensor hoop.\n We\u2019ve never stretched ourselves so thin before. Usually there\u2019s no need; with lightyears and epochs to play in, even the slowest fall brings us up to speed in plenty of time. We can\u2019t go past twenty percent lightspeed anyway, not without getting cooked by the blueshift. Usually Eri keeps her tongue in her mouth.\n Not this time. This time we\u2019re just another one of Hakim\u2019s holiday ornaments, dangling from a thread in a hurricane. According to the Chimp, that thread should hold. There are error bars, though, and not a lot of empirical observation to hang them on. The database on singularities nested inside asteroids nested inside incinerating ice giants is pretty heavy on the handwaving.\n And that\u2019s just the problem within the problem. Atmospheric docking with a world falling at two hundred kilometers a second is downright trivial next to predicting Thule\u2019s course inside the star: the drag inflicted by a millionth of a red-hot gram per cubic centimeter, stellar winds and thermohaline mixing, the deep magnetic torque of fossil helium. It\u2019s tough enough figuring out what \u201cinside\u201d even means when the gradient from vacuum to degenerate matter blurs across three million kilometers. Depending on your definition we might already be in the damn thing.\n Hakim turns to me as the Chimp lowers us toward the storm. \u201cMaybe we should wake them up.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cSunday. Ishmael. All of them.\u201d\n \u201cYou know how many thousands of us are stacked up down there?\u201d I know. Hakim might guess but this traitor knows right down to the last soul, without checking.\n Not that any of them would pat me on the back for that.\n \u201cWhat for?\u201d I ask.\n He shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s all theory. You know that. We could all be dead in a day.\u201d\n \u201cYou want to bring them back so they can be awake when they die?\u201d\n \u201cSo they can\u2014I don\u2019t know. Write a poem. Grow a sculpture. Shit, one or two of them might even be willing to make their peace with you before the end.\u201d\n \u201cSay we wake them up and we\u2019re not all dead in day. You\u2019ve just pushed our life support three orders of mag past spec.\u201d\n He rolls his eyes. \u201cThen we put everyone back down again. So it spikes the CO2. Nothing the forest won\u2019t be able to clear in a few centuries.\u201d\n I can barely hear the tremor in his voice.\n He\u2019s scared. That\u2019s what this is. He\u2019s scared, and he doesn\u2019t want to die alone. And I don\u2019t count.\n I suppose it\u2019s a start.\n \u201cCome on. At the very least it\u2019ll be a hell of a solstice party.\u201d\n \u201cAsk the Chimp,\u201d I suggest.\n His face goes hard. I keep mine blank.\n I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t serious anyway.\n The depths of the troposphere. The heart of the storm. Cliffs of water and ammonia billow across our path: airborne oceans shattered down to droplets, to crystals. They crash into our mountain at the speed of sound, freeze solid or cascade into space depending on the mood. Lightning flashes everywhere, stamps my brain stem with half-glimpsed afterimages: demon faces, and great clawed hands with too many fingers.\n Somehow the deck stays solid beneath my feet, unmoved even by the death throes of a world. I can\u2019t entirely suppress my own incredulity; even anchored by two million tonnes of basalt and a black hole, it seems impossible that we\u2019re not being tossed around like a mote in a wind tunnel.\n I squash the feed and the carnage vanishes, leaving nothing behind but bots and bulkheads and a ribbon of transparent quartz looking down onto the factory floor. I kill some time watching the assembly lines boot up in there, watching maintenance drones gestate in the vacuum past the viewport. Even best-case there\u2019s going to be damage. Cameras blinded by needles of supersonic ice or sheets of boiling acid. The whiskers of long-range antennae, drooping in the heat. Depending on the breaks it could take an army to repair the damage after we complete our passage. I take some comfort from the sight of the Chimp\u2019s troops assembling themselves.\n For an instant I think I hear a faint shriek down some far-off corridor: a breach, a decompression? No alarms, though. Probably just one of the roaches skidding around a bend in the corridor, looking for a recharge.\n I\u2019m not imagining the beeping in my head, though: Hakim, calling down from the bridge. \u201cYou need to be up here,\u201d he says when I open the channel.\n \u201cI\u2019m on the other side of the\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPlease,\u201d he says, and forks me a live feed: one of the bow clusters, pointing at the sky.\n A feature has emerged from the featureless overcast: a bright dimple on the dark sky, like a finger poking down through the roof of the world. It\u2019s invisible in visible light, hidden by torrents of ammonia and hydrocarbon hurricanes: but it shimmers in infrared like a rippling ember.\n I have no idea what it is.\n I draw an imaginary line through the ends of the wormhole. \u201cIt\u2019s in line with our displacement vector.\u201d\n \u201cNo shit it\u2019s in line. I think the wormhole\u2019s\u2014provoking it, somehow.\u201d\n It\u2019s radiating at over two thousand Kelvin.\n \u201cSo we\u2019re inside the star,\u201d I say, and hope Hakim takes it as good news.\n If nothing else, it means we\u2019re on schedule.\n We\u2019ve got so little to go on. We don\u2019t know how far we are from the ceiling: it keeps ablating away above us. We don\u2019t know how close we are to the core: it keeps swelling beneath the easing weight of all this shedding atmosphere. All we know is that temperature rises overhead and we descend; pressure rises from beneath and we climb. We\u2019re specks in the belly of some fish in empty mid-ocean, surface and seabed equally hypothetical. None of our reference points are any more fixed than we are. The Chimp presents estimates based on gravity and inertia, but even those are little more than guesses thanks to wormhole corruption of the local spacetime. We\u2019re stretched across the probability wave, waiting for the box to open so the universe can observe whether we\u2019re dead or alive.\n Hakim eyes me from across the tank, his face flickering in the light of a hundred cam feeds. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. We should be through by now.\u201d\n He\u2019s been saying that for the past hour.\n \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be variability,\u201d I remind him. \u201cThe model\u2014\u201d\n \u201cThe model.\u201d He manages a short, bitter laugh. \u201cBased on all those zettabytes we collected the other times we hitched a ride through a red giant. The model\u2019s shit. One hiccup in the magnetic field and we could be going down instead of out.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the problem.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s still dark.\u201d The atmosphere\u2019s still thick enough to keep Surtr\u2019s blinding interior at bay.\n \u201cAlways darkest before the dawn,\u201d Hakim says grimly, and points to that brightening smudge of infrared overhead.\n The Chimp can\u2019t explain it, for all the fresh realtime data he stuffs into his equations. All we know is that whatever it is, it hasn\u2019t budged from our displacement vector and it\u2019s getting hotter. Or maybe closer. It\u2019s hard to tell; our senses are hazy that far out, and we\u2019re not about to stick our heads above the clouds for a better view.\n Whatever it is, the Chimp doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s worth worrying about. He says we\u2019re almost through.\n The storm no longer freezes on impact. It spits and hisses, turns instantly to steam. Incessant lightning strobes the sky, stop-animates towering jigsaw monsters of methane and acetylene.\n God\u2019s mind might look like this, if He were an epileptic.\n We get in the way sometimes, block some deific synapse in mid-discharge: a million volts spike the hull and a patch of basalt turns to slag, or Eri goes blind in another eye. I\u2019ve lost count of the cameras and antennae and radar dishes we\u2019ve already lost. I just add it to the tally when another facet flares and goes dark at the edge of the collage.\n Hakim doesn\u2019t. \u201cPlay that again,\u201d he tells the Chimp. \u201cThat feed. Just before it fratzed.\u201d\n The last moments of the latest casualty: Eri\u2019s cratered skin, outcroppings of half-buried machinery. Lightning flickers in from Stage Left, stabs a radiator fin halfway to our lumpy horizon. A flash. A banal and overfamiliar phrase:\n No Signal.\n \u201cAgain,\u201d Hakim says. \u201cThe strike in the middle distance. Freeze on that.\u201d\n Three bolts, caught in the act\u2014and Hakim\u2019s onto something, I see now. There\u2019s something different about them, something less\u2014random\u2014than the fractal bifurcations of more distant lightning. Different color, too\u2014more of a bluish edge\u2014and smaller. The bolts in the distance are massive. These things arcing across the crust don\u2019t look much thicker than my own arm.\n They converge towards some bright mass just barely out of camera range.\n \u201cStatic discharge of some kind,\u201d I suggest.\n \u201cYeah? What kind, exactly?\u201d\n I can\u2019t see anything similar in the current mosaic, but the bridge bulkheads only hold so many windows and our surface cams still number in the thousands. Even my link can\u2019t handle that many feeds at once. \u201cChimp: any other phenomena like that on the surface?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d says the Chimp, and high-grades the display:\n Bright meshes swarming over stone and steel. Formations of ball lightning, walking on jagged stilts of electricity. Some kind of flat flickering plasma, sliding along Eri\u2019s crust like a stingray.\n \u201cShittttt . . . \u201d Hakim hisses. \u201cWhere did they come from?\u201d\n Our compound eye loses another facet.\n \u201cThey\u2019re targeting the sensors.\u201d Hakim\u2019s face is ashen.\n \u201cThey?\u201d Could just be electricity arcing to alloy.\n \u201cThey\u2019re blinding us. Oh Jesus fuck being trapped inside a star isn\u2019t bad enough there\u2019s gotta be hostile aliens in the bargain.\u201d\n My eyes flicker to the ceiling pickup. \u201cChimp, what are those things?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know. They could be something like Saint Elmo\u2019s Fire, or a buoyant plasma. I can\u2019t rule out some sort of maser effect either, but I\u2019m not detecting any significant microwave emissions.\u201d\n Another camera goes down. \u201cLightning bugs,\u201d Hakim says, and emits a hysterical giggle.\n \u201cAre they alive?\u201d I wonder.\n \u201cNot organically,\u201d the Chimp tells me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019d meet definitions based on entropy restriction.\u201d\n No conventional morphology there. Those aren\u2019t legs exactly, they\u2019re\u2014transient voltage arcs of some kind. And body shape\u2014if body even applies\u2014seems to be optional and fluid. Auroras bunch up into sparking balls; balls sprout loops or limbs or just blow away at Mach 2, vanishing into the storm.\n I call up a tactical composite. Huh: clustered distribution. A flock gathered at the skeletal remains of a long-dead thruster nozzle; another flickering across an evagineering hutch halfway down the starboard lateral line. A whole party in Eri\u2019s crater-mouth, swarming around our invisible bootstrap like water circling a drain.\n \u201cHoles,\u201d Hakim says softly. \u201cDepressions. Hatches.\u201d\n But something\u2019s caught my eye that doesn\u2019t involve any of those things, something unfolding overhead while our other eyes are fixed on the ground\u2014\n \u201cThey\u2019re trying to get in. That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n A sudden bright smudge in the sky. Then a tear; a hole; the dilating pupil of some great demonic eye. Dim bloody light floods down across the battered landscape as a cyclone opens over our heads, wreathed in an inflammation of lightning.\n Surtr\u2019s finger stretches down from Hades, visible at last to naked eyes.\n \u201cHoly shit . . . \u201d Hakim whispers.\n It\u2019s an incandescent tornado, a pillar of fire. It\u2019s outside reaching in, and if anything short of magic can explain its existence it\u2019s not known to me or the Chimp or the accumulated wisdom of all the astrophysicists nesting in our archives. It reaches down and touches our wormhole, just so. It bulges, as if inflamed by an embedded splinter; the swollen tip wobbles absurdly for a moment, then bursts\u2014\n \u2014and fire gushes down from the heavens in a liquid cascade. The things beneath scatter fast as forked lightning can carry them; here in the bridge, the view sparks and dies. From a dozen other viewpoints I see tongues of soft red plasma splashing across Eriophora\u2019s crust.\n Some rough alarm whispers fuck fuck fuck fuck at my side while Eri feeds me intelligence: something happening back at that lateral hutch. All those cams are down but there\u2019s a pressure surge at the outer hatch and a rhythmic hissing sound crackles in along the intercom.\n Hakim\u2019s vanished from the bridge. I hear the soft whine of his roach receding at full throttle. I duck out into the corridor, grab my own roach from its socket, follow. There\u2019s really no question where he\u2019s headed; I\u2019d know that even if the Chimp hadn\u2019t already laid out the map in my head.\n Way back along our starboard flank, something\u2019s knocking on the door.\n He\u2019s in the prep compartment by the time I catch up, scrambling into an EVA suit like some panicky insect trying to climb back into its cocoon. \u201cOuter hatch is breached,\u201d he tells me, forgetting.\n Just meters away. Past racks and suit alcoves, just the other side of that massive biosteel drawbridge, something\u2019s looking for a way in. It could find one, too; I can see heat shimmering off the hatch. I can hear the pop and crackle of arcing electricity coming through from the other side, the faint howl of distant hurricanes.\n \u201cNo weapons.\u201d Hakim fumbles with his gauntlets. \u201cMission to the end of time and they don\u2019t even give us weapons.\u201d Which is not entirely true. They certainly gave us the means to build weapons. I don\u2019t know if Hakim ever availed himself of that option but I remember his buddies, not so far from this very spot. I remember them pointing their weapons at me.\n \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d I gesture at the hatch; is it my imagination, or has it brightened a little in the center?\n He shakes his head, his breathing fast and shallow. \u201cI was gonna\u2014you know, the welding torches. The lasers. Thought we could stand them off.\u201d\n All stored on the other side.\n He\u2019s suited up to the neck. His helmet hangs on its hook within easy reach: a grab and a twist and he\u2019ll be self-contained again. For a while.\n Something pounds hard on the hatch. \u201cOh shit,\u201d Hakim says weakly.\n I keep my voice level. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n He takes a breath, steadies himself. \u201cWe, um\u2014we retreat. Out past the nearest dropgate.\u201d The Chimp takes the hint and throws an overlay across my inner map; back into the corridor and fifteen meters forward. \u201cAnything breaches, the gates come down.\u201d He nods at an alcove. \u201cGrab a suit, just in\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAnd when they breach the dropgates?\u201d I wonder. The biosteel\u2019s definitely glowing, there in the center.\n \u201cThe next set goes down. Jesus, you know the drill.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s your plan? Give up Eri in stages?\u201d\n \u201cSmall stages.\u201d He nods and swallows. \u201cBuy time. Figure out their weak spot.\u201d He grabs his helmet and turns towards the corridor.\n I lay a restraining hand on his shoulder. \u201cHow do we do that, exactly?\u201d\n He shrugs it off. \u201cWing it for fucksake! Get Chimp to customize some drones to go in and, and ground them or something.\u201d He heads for the door.\n This time the hand I lay on him is more than a suggestion. This time it clamps down, spins him around, pushes him against the bulkhead. His helmet bounces across the deck. His clumsy gloved hands come up to fend me off but there\u2019s no strength in them. His eyes do a mad little jig in his face.\n \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking this through,\u201d I say, very calmly.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no time to think it through! They might not even get past the gates, maybe they\u2019re not even trying, I mean\u2014\u201d His eyes brighten with faint and ridiculous hope. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not even an attack, I bet it\u2019s not, you know, they\u2019re just\u2014they\u2019re dying. It\u2019s the end of the world and their home\u2019s on fire and they\u2019re just looking for a place to hide, they\u2019re not looking for a way in they\u2019re looking for a way out\u2014\u201d\n \u201cWhat makes you think that inside\u2019s any less lethal to them than outside is to us?\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t have to be smart!\u201d he cries out. \u201cThey just have to be scared!\u201d\n Fingers of faint electricity flicker and crackle around the edges of the hatch: heat lightning, maybe. Or maybe something more prehensile.\n I keep Hakim pinned. \u201cWhat if they are smart? What if they\u2019re not just burrowing on instinct? What if they\u2019re the ones with the plan, hmm?\u201d\n He spreads his hands. \u201cWhat else can we do?\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t give them the chance to breach. We get out of here now.\u201d\n \u201cGet\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDitch the ice giant. Take our chances in the star.\u201d\n He stops struggling and stares, waiting for the punchline. \u201cYou\u2019re insane,\u201d he whispers when I fail to deliver.\n \u201cWhy? Chimp says we\u2019re almost through anyway.\u201d\n \u201cHe said that half an hour ago! And we were an hour past predicted exit even then!\u201d\n \u201cChimp?\u201d I say, not for the AI\u2019s benefit but for Hakim\u2019s.\n \u201cRight here.\u201d\n \u201cSay we max the wormhole. Throw out as much mass as we can, shortest path out of the envelope.\u201d\n \u201cTidal stress tears Eriophora into two debris clouds of roughly equal mass, each one centered on\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAmend that. Say we optimize distance and displacement to maximize velocity without losing structural integrity.\u201d\n I can tell by the wait that there are going to be serious confidence limits attached to the answer. \u201cEriophora is directly exposed to the stellar envelope for 1300 corsecs,\u201d he says at last. \u201cGive or take 450.\u201d\n At 2300 Kelvin. Basalt melts at 1724.\n But the Chimp hasn\u2019t finished. \u201cWe would also risk significant structural damage due to the migration of secondary centers-of-mass beyond Eriophora\u2019s hardlined displacement channels.\u201d\n \u201cDo we make it?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n Hakim throws up his hands. \u201cWhy the hell not? It\u2019s what you do!\u201d\n \u201cMy models can\u2019t account for the plasma invagination overhead or the electrical events on the hull,\u201d the Chimp tells him. \u201cTherefore they\u2019re missing at least one important variable. You can\u2019t trust my predictions.\u201d\n Down at the end of the compartment, the hatch glows red as the sky. Electricity sizzles and pops and grabs.\n \u201cDo it,\u201d Hakim says suddenly.\n \u201cI need consensus,\u201d the Chimp replies.\n Of course. The Chimp takes his lead from us meat sacks when he gets lost; but looking to us for wisdom, he wouldn\u2019t know whose to follow if we disagreed.\n Hakim waits, manic, his eyes flicking between me and the hatch. \u201cWell?\u201d he says after a moment.\n It all comes down to me. I could cancel him out.\n \u201cWhat are you waiting for? It was your fucking idea!\u201d\n I feel an urge to lean close and whisper in his ear. Not just Chimp\u2019s sock puppet now, am I, motherfucker? I resist it. \u201cSure,\u201d I say instead. \u201cGive it a shot.\u201d\n Wheels begin to turn. Eriophora trembles and groans, torqued by vectors she was never designed for. Unfamiliar sensations tickle my backbrain, move forward, root in my gut: the impossible, indescribable sense of down being in two places at once. One of those places is safe and familiar, beneath my feet, beneath decks and forests and bedrock at the very heart of the ship; but the other\u2019s getting stronger, and it\u2019s moving . . .\n I hear the scream of distant metal. I hear the clatter of loose objects crashing into walls. Eriophora lurches, staggers to port, turns ponderously on some axis spread across too many sickening dimensions. There\u2019s something moving behind the wall, deep in the rocks; I can\u2019t see it but I feel its pull, hear the cracking of new fault lines splitting ancient stone. A dozen crimson icons bloom like tumors in my brain, Subsystem Failure and Critical Coolant and Primary Channel Interrupt. A half-empty squeezebulb, discarded decades or centuries or millennia ago, wobbles half-levitating into view around the corner. It falls sideways and slides along the bulkhead, caught up in the tide-monster\u2019s wake.\n I\u2019m standing on the deck at forty-five degrees. I think I\u2019m going to be sick.\n The down beneath my feet is less than a whisper. I give silent thanks for superconducting ceramics, piezoelectric trusses, all reinforcements brute and magical that keep this little worldlet from crumbling to dust while the Chimp plays havoc with the laws of physics. I offer a diffuse and desperate prayer that they\u2019re up to the task. Then I\u2019m falling forward, upward, out: Hakim and I smack into the forward bulkhead as a rubber band, stretched to its limit, snaps free and hurls us forward.\n Surtr roars in triumph as we emerge, snatches at this tiny unexpected prize shaken free of the larger one. Jagged spiders leap away and vanish into blinding fog. Wireframe swirls of magnetic force twist in the heat, spun off from the dynamo way down in the giant\u2019s helium heart\u2014or maybe that\u2019s just the Chimp, feeding me models and imaginings. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not real; our eyes and ears and fingertips have all been licked away, our windows all gone dark. Skin and bones will be next to go: warm basalt, softening down to plastic. Maybe it\u2019s happening already. No way to tell any more. Nothing to do but fall out as the air flattens and shimmers in the rising heat.\n I\u2019m saving your life, Hakim. You better fucking appreciate it.\n Yeats was wrong. The center held after all.\n Now we are only half-blind, and wholly ballistic. A few eyes remain smoldering on the hull, pitted with cataracts; most are gone entirely. Charred stumps spark fitfully where sensors used to be. Eri\u2019s center of mass has snapped back into itself and is sleeping off the hangover down in the basement. We coast on pure inertia, as passive as any other rock.\n But we are through, and we are alive, and we have ten thousand years to lick our wounds.\n It won\u2019t take anywhere near that long, of course. The Chimp has already deployed his army; they burned their way out through the slagged doorways of a dozen service tunnels, laden with newly refined metals dug from the heart of the mountain. Now they clamber across the surface like great metal insects, swapping good parts for bad and cauterizing our wounds with bright light. Every now and then another dead window flickers back to life; the universe returns to us in bits and pieces. Surtr simmers in our wake, still vast but receding, barely hot enough to boil water this far out.\n I prefer the view ahead: deep comforting darkness, swirls of stars, glittering constellations we\u2019ll never see again and can\u2019t be bothered to name. Just passing through.\n Hakim should be down in the crypt by now, getting ready to turn in. Instead I find him back in the starboard bridge, watching fingers of blue-white lightning leap across the hull. It\u2019s a short clip and it always ends the same way, but he seems to find value in repeat viewings.\n He turns at my approach. \u201cSanduloviciu plasma.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cElectrons on the outside, positive ions on the inside. Self-organizing membranes. Live ball lightning. Although I don\u2019t know what they\u2019d use as a rep code. Some kind of quantum spin liquid, maybe.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cThe guys who discovered these things didn\u2019t have much to say about heredity.\u201d\n He\u2019s talking about primitive experiments with gas and electricity, back in some prehistoric lab from the days before we launched (I know: Chimp fed me the archive file the moment Hakim accessed it). \u201cWe\u2019re the guys who discovered them,\u201d I point out; the things that clawed at our doorstep were lightyears beyond anything those cavemen ever put together.\n \u201cNo we didn\u2019t.\u201d\n I wait.\n \u201cThey discovered us,\u201d he tells me.\n I feel a half-smile pulling at the corner of my mouth.\n \u201cI keep thinking about the odds,\u201d Hakim says. \u201cA system that looks so right from a distance and turns out to be so wrong after we\u2019ve committed to the flyby. All that mass and all those potential trajectories, and somehow the only way out is through the goddamn star. Oh, and there\u2019s one convenient ice giant that just happens to be going our way. Any idea what those odds are?\u201d\n \u201cAstronomical.\u201d I keep a straight face.\n He shakes his head. \u201cInfinitesimal.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking the same thing,\u201d I admit.\n Hakim gives me a sharp glance. \u201cHave you now.\u201d\n \u201cThe way the whole system seemed primed to draw us into the star. The way that thing reached down to grab us once we were inside. Your lightning bugs: I don\u2019t think they were native to the planet at all, not if they were plasma-based.\u201d\n \u201cYou think they were from the star.\u201d\n I shrug.\n \u201cStar aliens,\u201d Hakim says.\n \u201cOr drones of some kind. Either way, you\u2019re right; this system didn\u2019t just happen. It was a sampling transect. A trapline.\u201d\n \u201cWhich makes us what, exactly? Specimens? Pets? Hunting trophies?\u201d\n \u201cAlmost. Maybe. Who knows?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe buddies, hmm?\u201d\n I glance up at the sudden edge in his voice.\n \u201cMaybe just allies,\u201d he muses. \u201cIn adversity. Because it\u2019s all for one against the common enemy, right?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s generally good strategy.\u201d It felt good, too, not being the bad guy for a change. Being the guy who actually pulled asses out of the fire.\n I\u2019ll settle for allies.\n \u201cBecause I can see a couple of other coincidences, if I squint.\u201d He\u2019s not squinting, though. He\u2019s staring straight through me. \u201cLike the way the Chimp happened to pair me up with the one person on the whole roster I\u2019d just as soon chuck out an airlock.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s hardly a coincidence,\u201d I snort. \u201cIt\u2019d be next to impossible to find someone who didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n Oh.\n The accusation hangs in the air like static electricity. Hakim waits for my defense.\n \u201cYou think the Chimp used this situation to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cUsed,\u201d he says, \u201cor invented.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s insane. You saw it with your own eyes, you can still see\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI saw models in a tank. I saw pixels on bulkheads. I never threw on a suit to go see for myself. You\u2019d have to be suicidal, right?\u201d\n He\u2019s actually smiling.\n \u201cThey tried to break in,\u201d I remind him.\n \u201cOh, I know something was pounding on the door. I\u2019m just not sold on the idea that it was built by aliens.\u201d\n \u201cYou think this whole thing was some kind of trick?\u201d I shake my head in disbelief. \u201cWe\u2019ll have surface access in a couple of weeks. Hell, just cut a hole into Fab right now, crawl out through one of the service tunnels. See for yourself.\u201d\n \u201cSee what? A star off the stern?\u201d He shrugs. \u201cRed giants are common as dirt. Doesn\u2019t mean the specs on this system were anywhere near as restrictive as Chimp says. Doesn\u2019t mean we had to go through, doesn\u2019t even mean we did. For all I know the Chimp had its bots strafing the hull with lasers and blowtorches for the past hundred years, slagging things down to look nice and convincing just in case I did pop out for a look-see.\u201d Hakim shakes his head. \u201cAll I know is, it\u2019s only had one meat sack in its corner since the mutiny, and he\u2019s not much good if no one will talk to him. But how can you keep hating someone after he\u2019s saved your life?\u201d\n It astonishes me, the degree to which people torture reason. Just to protect their precious preconceptions.\n \u201cThe weird thing,\u201d Hakim adds, almost to himself, \u201cis that it worked.\u201d\n It takes a moment for that to sink in.\n \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think you were in on it,\u201d he explains. \u201cI don\u2019t think you had a clue. How could you? You\u2019re not even a whole person, you\u2019re just a\u2014a glorified subroutine. And subroutines don\u2019t question their inputs. A thought pops into your head, you just assume it\u2019s yours. You believe everything that miserable piece of hardware tells you, because you don\u2019t have a choice. Maybe you never did.\n \u201cHow can I hate you for that?\u201d he asks.\n I don\u2019t answer, so he does: \u201cI can\u2019t. Not any more. I can only\u2014\u201d\n \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d I say, and turn my back.\n He leaves me then, leaves me surrounded by all these pixels and pictures he refuses to accept. He heads back to the crypt to join his friends. The sleeping dead. The weak links. Every last one of them would scuttle the mission, given half a chance.\n If it was up to me none of them would ever wake up again. But Chimp reminds me of the obvious: a mission built for aeons, the impossibility of anticipating even a fraction of the obstacles we\u2019re bound to encounter. The need for flexibility, for the wet sloppy intelligence that long-dead engineers excluded from his architecture in the name of mission stability. Billions of years ahead of us, perhaps, and only a few thousand meat sacks to deal with the unexpected. There may not be enough of us as it is.\n And yet, with all that vaunted human intellect, Hakim can\u2019t see the obvious. None of them can. I\u2019m not even human to those humans. A subroutine, he says. A lobe in something else\u2019s brain. But I don\u2019t need his fucking pity. He\u2019d realize that if he thought about it for more than a split-second, if he was willing to examine that mountain of unexamined assumptions he calls a worldview.\n He won\u2019t, though. He refuses to look into the mirror long enough to see what\u2019s looking back. He can\u2019t even tell the difference between brain and brawn. The Chimp drives the ship; the Chimp builds the jump gates; the Chimp runs life support. We try to take the reins of our own destiny and it\u2019s the Chimp who hammers us down.\n So the Chimp is in control. The Chimp is always in control; and when minds merge across this high-bandwidth link in my head, surely it will be the mech that absorbs the meat.\n It astonishes me that he can\u2019t see the fallacy. He knows the Chimp\u2019s synapse count as well as I do, but he\u2019d rather fall back on prejudice than run the numbers.\n I\u2019m not the Chimp\u2019s subroutine at all.\n The Chimp is mine.\n Originally published in Extreme Planets,edited by David Conyers, David Kernot, and Jeff Harris, 2014.\n Peter Watts\u2014author of Blindsight, Echopraxia, and the Rifters Trilogy, among other things\u2014seems especially popular among people who don't know him.

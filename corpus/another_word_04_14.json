Seems pretty safe as assumptions go. And because of that, you\u2019re probably aware of the conflicts that have been troubling the online community of fans and professionals recently: Toni Weisskopf\u2019s essay on fandom and John Scalzi\u2019s response, Jonathan Ross hosting the Hugo Awards, Sean Fodera\u2019s comments on Mary Robinette Kowal, Truesdale\u2019s petition about the SFWA Bulletin, Wiscon\u2019s disinvitation Elizabeth Moon, Racefail \u201809.\n The list goes on, I am reliably informed, back through Silverberg\u2019s famous insistence that James Tiptree Jr. couldn\u2019t possibly be a woman, Ballard and Moorcock\u2019s advancement of the New Wave, and pretty much everything Harlan Ellison\u2019s ever done until it disappears in the mists of history sometime before 1930.\n This, for better or worse, is the water we swim in now, and probably always was before. As with everything else in our culture, the Internet has made it weirder and faster and more immediate and more anonymous. We\u2019ve had lots of calls for civility, and lots of responses that those calls for civility usually mean you\u2019d like the other person to shut up and stop bothering you. We\u2019ve had a lot of reasoned, careful commentary by thoughtful people, and a lot of public venting of spleen. We\u2019ve had people who genuinely wanted to come to some deeper understanding and accord, and some who seem to like lighting conversations on fire just to watch them burn.\n Science fiction and fantasy\u2014more than any other genre\u2014has a deep tradition of direct engagement of fans and writers. The narrative of fandom as community\u2014almost as family\u2014was around long before I came on the scene. Truth of the matter is, fandom can be a bruising place to be a professional and a fan. Maybe it\u2019s worse now than it was before, maybe it\u2019s only different. But it\u2019s left me thinking about conflict, rage, rhetorical violence, my experience with them, and the decisions I\u2019ve made about who I want to be publically and professionally.\n I\u2019m going to say this again: I\u2019m not telling anybody what they should do. I\u2019m not interested in dictating how folks act or speak, what they should believe or how they should believe it. Not that I don\u2019t have opinions about that, but I\u2019m not writing a sermon.\n Right now, I\u2019m just laying out part of what I think and how I got here, and what Marshall Rosenberg, bell hooks, and Marcus Aurelius have to do with it. If it\u2019s useful to you, that\u2019s great. If it\u2019s not, you\u2019ll maybe have another perspective on it. Or on me. That\u2019s fine too.\n So there\u2019s this guy, JB. He\u2019s been a friend of mine since middle school, and has always been more spiritual and more religious\u2014though that\u2019s not quite the right word for him\u2014and more engaged with justice than I am. Turns out that\u2019s not actually a very high bar, but he clears it. His track record on recommending interesting, thought-provoking books is really good, and maybe a decade ago, maybe a little more than that, he pointed me toward an author named Marshall Rosenberg, and a book called Nonviolent Communication.\n I can\u2019t express clearly enough how much I dislike this book. Not the content\u2014which I\u2019ll get to in a minute\u2014but the style. This is the most touchy-feely, Pollyanna, syrupy-sweet, Kumbaya-singing book I have ever pulled my self through by the eyelashes. It\u2019s got amateur rhyming poetry in it about people and their hearts. I\u2019m not this guy. My skin crawled when I read this, as it has every time I\u2019ve reread it since. (This, turns out, is a lot.) Because wrapped in this chalky candy heart of a book is a manual for how to invite\u2014even insist on\u2014conflict, and see it through until it\u2019s resolved.\n It talks about withholding judgment, cultivating compassion, listening deeply (and how to include some error correction in that) all with the aim of having actual, meaningful communication happen. And the thing that was most revelatory to me in reading it was the analysis of how useful conflict happens in a range. We can avoid it by minimizing it\u2014turning away, pretending there\u2019s not a problem\u2014or by escalating out of it, derailing it into name calling and judgments.\n If you had to pick a single book that has had the most effect on my public persona, this one\u2019s it. I grew up with insults and wit where other kids just hit each other. I have a very good toolbox when it comes to verbal violence\u2014I\u2019m kind of good at it. And we have a long and vibrant history of gadflies and bullies in our community. Engaging in that is tempting for me, not in the least because I\u2019m pretty sure I could hold my own even in some pretty high weight classes. This is to say, I know I can escalate out of a conflict. I know I can tease people into a kind of semi-coherent rage. I\u2019ve done it; we called it high school. And, from what I hear from my cohorts, part of college. It could have been my professional persona. But instead I got interested in this other set of tools, and this other way to have conflicts. Instead of being showy and witty and clever and outrageous, I got to dissect what the issues really are. It turns out that I like that better.\n Rosenberg\u2014like pretty much everyone who\u2019s been engaged with fandom in the last few years\u2014had to talk about anger. Anger is the emotion most closely associated with violence. That\u2019s true for me, and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s true for you. And this is true to the point that the two often get confused. Expressions of anger often read like rhetorical violence, and criticisms of someone\u2019s rhetorical style are easy to confuse with (or conflate with or use as) telling the writer that their emotions are wrong. Rosenberg is utterly against violence in how we talk to each other. But he\u2019s strongly in favor of the complete, accurate, and uncompromising expression of anger.\n I had to sit with that for a long time before I had any idea what he was talking about. It wasn\u2019t an easy thing for me to parse, and I still struggle with it sometimes. The good news is, I have an example I can go back to.\n When I picked up the book Killing Rage by Dr. bell hooks, I thought that the title would be an essay about how to, y\u2019know, kill rage. Get rid of it. Boy-howdy, did I have that wrong. The essay Killing Rage is about living in a state of justified anger, and as a piece of writing, it\u2019s a thing of beauty.\n Full disclosure: I think bell hooks is one of the best thinkers we have about race, gender, violence, and punishment that we\u2019ve got. That particular essay is a difficult, upsetting read. It\u2019s more than a description of anger; it\u2019s an expression of it. It gives the context for it, examples that explain and justify it, and a description of a bone-deep, powerful anger. She talks about the temptation to violence. She describes having violent, even murderous, fantasies.\n And\u2014here\u2019s why I will never stop admiring her\u2014she never escalates out of the conflict. She never becomes easy to discount or put down. She expresses, even evokes, pain in a way that demands the reader stand witness to it. And she envisions moving it \u201cbeyond fruitless scapegoating of any group, linking it instead to a passion for freedom and justice that illuminates, heals, and makes redemptive struggle possible.\u201d\n She gave me an example of the difference between anger and violence.\n This also seems like the right moment to mention it again: I\u2019m not telling anybody what they should do.\n I\u2019ve also adopted Marcus Aurelius as one of my intellectual bodyguards. Here\u2019s this guy with the power of a god among men. He was the Emperor of the only superpower of his time. He was able to order anyone who offended him to die, able to order any woman he desired to his bed; a man in a position of almost no social restraint. Yet, when you read his meditations, it\u2019s like you\u2019re talking to someone who\u2019s been working in tech support too long.\n Begin each day by telling yourself, \u201cToday I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness; all of them due to the offender\u2019s ignorance of what is good and what is evil.\u201d Or, another of my favorites, \u201cThe art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.\u201d\n I\u2019ll go back to Marcus on the days where I need someone to remind me that people are just people\u2014venal, selfish, immoral, mean-spirited, small\u2014and that it isn\u2019t my problem. I have control over who I am, and over what I do, and if I can get that shit under control, I\u2019m actually doing pretty well. When it comes to being in this community of professionals and amateurs and fans, where we are hip deep in grievances both legitimate and bizarre, these three folks are my touchstones. They\u2019re who I\u2019ve chosen to cultivate.\n I would like the field to be more civil, so I\u2019m going to be civil, even when I think I\u2019d be justified not to. I would like the conversations we have to be more compassionate, so I\u2019m going to try to exercise compassion when I\u2019m talking to folks, even when I think they\u2019re full of shit. When I\u2019m angry about something, I\u2019ll try to express that completely and fully and while keeping my temper. When someone\u2019s angry with me, I'll try to listen past my defensiveness to what they\u2019re saying, whether I agree with them or not. When I think someone is arguing with me in bad faith, I\u2019m going to walk away.\n I\u2019d like our conflicts about ideology, politics, and religion to be less violent, so I\u2019m trying to be less violent when I talk about them. On the days I can\u2019t bring myself to that, I stay off the Internet.\n I would like my field to respect the quality of work more than the skin tone or sexual preferences of the author who wrote it, so I try to celebrate good work by folks who I think deserve more attention than they\u2019ve gotten. I try to tack against the parts of mainstream culture that I think are crap, and hopefully I get it right more than I screw it up.\n I\u2019m trying to become the change I want to see in the field; more professional, thoughtful, compassionate, non-violent, and open to conflict and change.\n And part of that? I\u2019m not telling anybody what they should do.\n Daniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

Heilui keeps half the window opaque to block out the field of endless machine-dead, the sight of satellites pressed against the skyline like bruised mouths on a gash. The other half she fills with a news feed: disasters in montage, kaleidoscope of calamities\u2014cities gone dark and still, streets turned to web-cracks and sidewalks impact-raised into briars, balconies smeared in blackened lymph and rust-red blots.\n She has watched it many times; has been made to, during the interrogation. The footage never fails to pull at her heart like the moon exerting its gravity on the acid tides. Pulling at her like the questions from back then, the faces and names lined up and Did you associate with this woman? This man? This woman? This man, this man, this man.\n Heilui\u2019s hands are clammy with the sweat of remembered terror, the memory of teetering on the edge of freefall. She wipes them dry. Her lap is heavy with gifts prepared by relatives: engagement boxes of jade bangles and figurines, silk slippers threaded in gold, a bag of crystallized fruits. A kintsugi bowl: black pottery broken and mended in silver, the seams radiant with age. Foreign antique, contributed by a wealthy adventurer aunt.\n The train notifies her that another passenger will be joining her, transferred after one of the carriages have detached for another station. She sweeps up the gifts and blanks out the news feed.\n The compartment opens in a murmur of dry, rustling leaves. A young man takes the seat opposite, giving her a respectful distance. They exchange small talk: he is heading southwest for a research lab, armed with a postgraduate grant from the University of Rajamongkol.\n \u201cAnd you, older sister?\u201d\n She cups her palm over the antique bowl, fingering its chimera texture, rough earth striated with the velvet smoothness of precious metal. \u201cI\u2019m on my way,\u201d Heilui whispers, \u201cto meet my bride.\u201d\n The Institute, the halfway house, sits ensconced in the hothouse hill: mantled in rough foliage, insulated from the machine ruins and their radiative hunger. This close, ignoring the wasteland of charred clay and half-alive intelligences is impossible, though Heilui tries to focus elsewhere, lash her attention to the interior of the car and the imminent appointment. Some of the interference nevertheless slips through, crooning ancient lullabies of wars eons gone, status dispatches from combat centuries ended. Some are foreign, some are in Putongwa and Fukginwa. Others are in Dakman with a smattering of Yingman recounting casualties. Strange-sounding names crowd in a white-noise fog, synthetic and toneless.\n Within the Institute\u2019s walls the wasteland sky is blocked out by a seashell husk, bred into immensity to shield the entire compound. She is received at the gate by a guidance routine taking the form of a red-beaked crane. It gives her directions in a perky tourmaline voice and instructs her to avoid contact with candidates other than her own. Heilui is glad to comply, though she does steal glances at the manicured topiary and moss-ridden trellises, the small gazebos and polished benches. Young women and younger men, ghost-pale and exotic, in muted cosmetics and pastel dresses. They drift eyes downward or sit prim and quiet. She can\u2019t spot any of them in conversation with one another; they arrange themselves as though hyper-conscious of an audience.\n The crane guides her to a private vestibule, where a low table waits with tea and covered wicker baskets. Heilui lifts the lids to find radish pastries and steamed red-pork buns. She doesn\u2019t sample either; no point leaving crumbs all over herself and marring that first impression. Instead she stacks up the gifts. Briefly she wonders if she should have brought a bouquet\u2014the culture of her bride\u2019s birth values flowers as a courtship sign, though she imagines their bouquets must be as translucent as their people, frosted leaves and ivory petals, flora gone extinct when that continent heaved and broke.\n It is then that the crane starts speaking in her interrogator\u2019s voice. Heilui nearly leaps out of her seat.\n \u201cRelax, Doctor Lan,\u201d says the interrogator, that same mild contralto she remembers. \u201cWe chose you for the case because we believe you better equipped than most to manage her. The subject has been neutralized entirely and you needn\u2019t fear that she will be a danger.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Heilui licks parched lips.\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t a test, though when the operation concludes successfully your profile will be cleaned up. No longer a person of interest, no more record of your unfortunate\u2014but entirely innocuous of course, as you\u2019ve proven\u2014association with occidental terrorists. Good luck.\u201d\n The line cuts. The vestibule\u2019s partition folds aside and Heilui\u2019s bride enters.\n Kerttu is tall and large-boned, as her people often are, bred in a land of giant-myths and arctic blaze. In echo of this image her hair is pale as snowdrift. Eyelashes mascara-gilded, eyelids faintly dusted copper, cheekbones accentuated to skeletal sharpness as though to compensate for the unreality of her pallor. The only spot of color above her neck is the fuchsia on her lips, applied to hone the corners of her mouth to crisp edges. Her bodice is closely fitted, the sleeves gradating from peach to oxblood cuffs, the skirt narrow and long: the colors are some of Heilui\u2019s favorites, the style close to what she might herself wear. The Institute has been attentive.\n So ordinary, Heilui thinks, and tries to visualize Kerttu as she once was\u2014in a lab coat, imperious over her empire of living matrices, her gleaming hives of bioweapons. But she can\u2019t quite picture it, this woman as the engineer of genocides.\n Kerttu gives an antique bow, one fist cupped inside her palm. \u201cHappy new year, Doctor Lan.\u201d\n \u201cHeilui will do, please. Sit. Have you eaten?\u201d She nods at the dishes, wondering if Kerttu can use chopsticks. \u201cYour Gwongdungwa is excellent.\u201d An odd, piquant accent but she\u2019s hardly going to criticize.\n \u201cYou honor me. I\u2019ve had fine teachers.\u201d\n A conversational dead-end. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about yourself?\u201d\n One long, slow blink. The occidental woman\u2019s pupils are unnervingly black, emphasized as they are by irises the hue of jellyfishes. \u201cWhy did you pick me, Doctor?\u201d\n Heilui turns the teacups upright. Pours. A distinct scent of plum rises. \u201cPerhaps I spotted you in the Institute database and recognized destiny at first sight.\u201d She pushes a cup over. \u201cIn Jatbun, they say that a red thread joins fated partners and you only need to pursue it to the other end. When you find yours, at once you will know it\u2014the tug in your blood through your thumb as your fortune draws taut as pipa strings.\u201d\n Kerttu curls her fingers around the teacup without flinching from the heat. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was my looks. There are others here younger than I am, more aesthetically pleasing. Is it the novelty of having a former mafia researcher and tamed war criminal for a wife?\u201d\n \u201cYou are a person, not a novelty object,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Institute recommended you, I thought it a fine suggestion, and I\u2019m under some pressure to wed.\u201d\n \u201cMany factors affect the making of a purchase. Desirable attributes go on one side of the scale, the price tag on the other. This is perhaps the most honest form of marriage.\u201d Kerttu sips gingerly, her expression pinching at the sourness, the unfamiliar. \u201cIs that why you opted for the Institute instead of selecting from your peers? Though I think the latter might have been cheaper.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted my options from a different pool, and I chose you. Is that not enough? You can say no.\u201d\n \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d This is said quickly, breathless like a gunshot.\n Heilui holds out her hand. \u201cShall we try to make this work?\u201d\n Kerttu takes it, and with those painted lips kisses Heilui\u2019s fingertips one by one.\n They marry on the train, the world\u2019s ruin rushing past in silent witness. Kerttu hands over a fistful of gold earrings as though they burn her and, with detached grace, accepts the small mountain of dowry. She puts on the one bangle large enough for her wrist as the portable altar officiates: simulated incense and ancestors, two-dimensional gods rotating to give them blessings\u2014mercy, prosperity, fertility. Kerttu\u2019s identity rearranges itself to Lan Kerttu, alphabet to calligraphy.\n \u201cThere\u2019s usually much more ceremony,\u201d Heilui says, apologetic, \u201cand nine courses of food. And your family would see you off . . . \u201d\n \u201cThis is fine.\u201d Her wife cradles the kintsugi bowl, thumb running laps around its rim. \u201cThe last wedding I attended was a conflagration of opulence with a twenty-course banquet\u2014one could die of abundance, asphyxiate on splendor. But it also involved people getting shot in the head and a couple of poisonings, though at least both grooms were unscathed. I also haven\u2019t had a family since I was six.\u201d\n That factoid Heilui knows, though she can\u2019t conceive of being kinless. There should have been relatives to raise her, a small herd of uncles and aunts and in-laws. \u201cHow did you like the Institute?\u201d\n \u201cAll of us hid our old lives; we never discussed our history and if we recognized each other from before, we pretended ignorance. Many of us wear scars.\u201d Kerttu holds up her wrists, showing them unmarred and smooth, and points at her throat: just as clean, all the access points to arteries without scars. \u201cNot me, though. I\u2019ve never been able to stand the sight of my own blood, the weight of my own pain. What we discussed all the time, where the cameras didn\u2019t reach, was our prospective clients. Who they might be, what sort of services we might be required to provide. Until a week ago, Doctor, I had no inkling of who you were.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d have liked an introduction sooner, but their protocols are so strict. They did treat you well?\u201d A needless question; the Institute keeps its charges in the greatest comfort.\n \u201cI never wanted for anything.\u201d Kerttu sets the bowl aside. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d\n The subject has been neutralized entirely. \u201cWhy would I need to be afraid of my bride?\u201d\n In good time they arrive home, a complex of four tapered serpent-buildings wound loosely around a central hall. Redwood columns clad in bismuth crystal, flat roofs topped in gunmetal tiles, a modest lake: from what she knows Kerttu lived in more sumptuous arrangements, a spider citadel of phantasmagoria matrices and psychedelic weave, but her wife nevertheless widens her eyes as they disembark. \u201cHow many live here?\u201d Kerttu asks softly. \u201cI thought you only lived with your family.\u201d\n \u201cI do. Extended family. Isn\u2019t that the way it\u2019s supposed to be?\u201d Heilui pulls up a layout of the estate, cupping the display in her palm like an egg of enameled rime. \u201cThe southwest hall belongs to my grandparents and some great-grandparents, the southeast one\u2014oh, Aunt Daruwan lives there but she\u2019s not in. Probably off unearthing crash sites or mapping crisis regions, you\u2019d like her. Here, we\u2019re in the northeastern one, the Tangerine.\u201d\n By luck it is dinner hour, most of the family is assembled in the communal hall. No one is there to crowd in and overwhelm them when they enter the Tangerine\u2019s sunset corridors. Kerttu\u2019s luggage trails behind them, as silent as its owner. Even her suitcases are Institute-mandated for refinement, matte-black leather and copper filigree. Heilui suspects that when they unpack, Kerttu\u2019s wardrobe will precisely match Heilui\u2019s tastes. That is something she will need to remedy\u2014a trip to the city, a stop at a tailor\u2019s boutique. The Institute is exacting and thorough in how it molds its charges, but that level of micromanagement bothers her despite the brittleness of all this, the fraught weight of Kerttu\u2019s presence.\n Heilui\u2019s segment of the house spans three units, study, bedroom, and a simulator box where she does most of her work. \u201cI\u2019ll get you your own bed.\u201d She gestures at a modular divan. \u201cUntil then, I hope you won\u2019t mind that?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t wish me to share yours?\u201d Kerttu absently pets her luggage, but her attention is on Heilui. A smile grows on her lips, like weeds, like thorns. \u201cI would, sincerely, find it no chore.\u201d\n Talons of heat sizzle on the back of Heilui\u2019s ears. \u201cPlease make yourself comfortable. The bath is down the corridor.\u201d\n \u201cThank you.\u201d Kerttu twists apart the sleeves of her dress as though about to disrobe on the spot, casting off the fabric the way a snake molts. \u201cMay I ask a question?\u201d\n \u201cBy all means.\u201d\n \u201cWhat did I cost you?\u201d She is loosening the collars. A glimpse of clavicles, nearly paper-white, veins shining through. \u201cI know that no money changed hands; the Institute takes currencies much more nebulous. But there is an essential truth that governs existence, greater and stronger than any force, and it is that on every object there is a price. What was mine?\u201d\n Heilui laughs, faltering. The dress recedes and a shoulder comes bare, rounded and marked with a tattoo that declares Kerttu\u2019s former allegiance. Butterflies congregating on a corpse, proboscises sipping sweat: the crest of a cartel, the symbol of ownership. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than that. We could discuss it one day. Tomorrow I\u2019ll introduce you to my family.\u201d\n At breakfast, everyone convenes to see the foreign bride.\n She sits like a mannequin of frost and plaster, consuming porridge and condiments as solemnly as a funeral meal. The Lan children gawk at her openly; one of Heilui\u2019s youngest nieces whispers\u2014audibly\u2014speculating whether Kerttu\u2019s pallor might leave white smudges on the utensils and tea-bowls; whether it might rub off on the furniture like icing. Their parents shush them, but adult scrutiny is hardly more discreet. Heilui\u2019s mothers regard Kerttu with pointed appraisal, no doubt already cataloguing many faults and improprieties.\n On her part Kerttu behaves as though she is by herself, facing an empty room, the round ivory-and-teak table all her own rather than occupied by fifteen. Occasionally, as though she is remembering from etiquette training, she puts food on Heilui\u2019s plate\u2014a knot of pork floss, a slice of yaujagwai. This is done stiffly and gingerly. Kerttu, Heilui recalls, wouldn\u2019t be used to sharing food this way; where she came from each person keeps to their own dish, even among family and intimate friends.\n Heilui makes desultory conversation and asks after Aunt Daruwan. She knows that once her family can corner her alone she\u2019ll be barraged with questions; she has told none of them of Kerttu\u2019s background, allowing them to believe that her choice of spouse is conventional and untied to any state interest. Already an uncle and two cousins are bombarding her with messages. She mutes the notifications and, at the first polite opportunity, excuses herself. Kerttu makes her obeisance, courtly, to family elders and follows Heilui\u2019s suit.\n They find a spot by one of the garden gates, behind an enclosure of hybrid bamboos and ceramic partitions. Kerttu arranges her skirts\u2014fuller today, loosely made; another style Heilui herself likes\u2014and folds herself like a paper puppet. \u201cAm I making things difficult?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019ll come around, everyone just needs time to adjust.\u201d Heilui silences another message, unread, and extends her palm. \u201cHere\u2019s a prototype I\u2019ve been working on. Very unfinished, more a framework than anything.\u201d\n \u201cIt appears to be an anthropological modeling program.\u201d Kerttu tilts her head. \u201cNot my field, Doctor. I was a biochemist.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a sim of the shattered continent. I\u2019ve been ambitious with the scope and detail, so I would like\u2014\u201d She gives a laugh, makes a helpless gesture. \u201cAn authenticity check, maybe? I\u2019ll get you your own shell, it\u2019s last-generation and I haven\u2019t upgraded it for a while, but . . . \u201d\n \u201cIt was a research subject that you required then, not a spouse.\u201d\n \u201cNot at all!\u201d Heilui says quickly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go into the city? You can pick out your own clothes.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re treating me extravagantly for a person you purchased.\u201d The biochemist turns the shell this way and that, her painted nails a shock of aqua against her phantom skin. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that to be judgmental or bitter\u2014I\u2019m neither; I\u2019ve been owned since I was young, treated as investment, my intelligence bought and traded for. I understand my position perfectly. There\u2019s no need to woo me. Ask and I will serve.\u201d\n A frisson sings through Heilui, chased by a wash of nausea: for a moment she could understand the sick supremacy of commanding utter, total power over another human being. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you to a tailor.\u201d\n She loads her spare shell with the modeling client and turns that over to Kerttu, who engages the program with the rapt concentration of a sniper on her target. When they reach the commerce arcade, Kerttu looks up blinking as though jolted from a trance. She folds the shell away and surveys the velvet web of shops, the walkways weaving through them like ribbons. Tension pinches her expression as they join the crowd\u2019s flow, families in New Year finery, children and young couples out to spend their red envelope money.\n Surreptitiously, Heilui searches the faces around them for a trace of the foreign, perhaps a declaration of suspicious intent etched into the downturn of a mouth, sewn into the hem of a skirt or sleeve, a glimpse of the butterflies emblem. But she finds nothing, sighting no set of features that is not everyday and ordinary to her, no complexion as startling as Kerttu\u2019s or a nose so angular. She does not find the man who slaughtered countries, the man who once owned her wife.\n \u201cSomething\u2019s making you uncomfortable.\u201d Heilui loops her arm through Kerttu\u2019s. \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m the only foreigner here.\u201d Kerttu has switched to Dakman, harsh and rolling.\n \u201cOh, you don\u2019t need to worry\u2014the staff here is perfectly used to foreigners. There are expatriates all over Kowloon, of every nationality you can imagine. I\u2019ll put you in touch with them, if you like.\u201d\n \u201cBy law I\u2019m forbidden from making contact with those from the shattered continent, just as I\u2019m forbidden from pursuing my previous specialty. I\u2019m wearing certain implants to ensure my compliance. I appreciate your thought, Doctor.\u201d\n At the tailor, Kerttu is imaged by a dozen mannequins that revolve slowly on their feet, laughing and animated as they flicker from style to style, season to season. In the end she chooses a postmodern keipou, unpatterned black sheathing her like carapace. Sleeveless, high crescent collars, unrelieved contrast between fabric and complexion making a monochrome print of Kerttu. \u201cI lost much and there was never a funeral,\u201d she explains the color. \u201cI need to mourn. I expect I\u2019ll always be mourning.\u201d\n But this, like everything else, is said with distance as though discussing someone else\u2019s grief.\n Their next stop is the Shau Kei Wan Temple, where Tinhau presides. Not the most traditional choice when it comes to matrimony, but Heilui has a special fondness for the sea goddess, and this temple is one of the few where Kwunyam is depicted in her male aspect while the war god Kwantai is presented as a woman: green-robed and armored, puissant with restrained fury. Heilui shows Kerttu the correct paper offerings to make, the right number of virtual incenses to ignite. They shake kaucim cups side by side, have the cast of their fortune read by streamed oracles.\n It belatedly occurs to Heilui, on their way back, to ask Kerttu if she is a monotheist. Her wife shrugs, a peculiarly foreign gesture. \u201cMy faith rests in the belief that the human capability for innovation and malice is infinite. I admit no other gods, pray to no other pantheon. I\u2019ve never been disappointed.\u201d\n Back at the Lan house they are ambushed at the gate, a gaggle of nieces and nephews swarming over Kerttu. Heilui presses a sheaf of red envelopes into her wife\u2019s hand, each filled with account chips. \u201cOne per head,\u201d she says, grinning. Under the shade of a butterfly tree, one of her mothers is waiting; she knows what that look means. \u201cDon\u2019t let them get greedy. Make them say the magic phrase first.\u201d\n Kerttu holds the envelopes loosely and stares in bemusement, to a high-pitched chorus of gong hei fat choi. Heilui draws aside to join Mother Meitin under the fluttering, winged canopy. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d Meitin does not quite glance sidelong at Kerttu. \u201cAbout . . . that.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s not a that, Mother.\u201d\n \u201cAre you going to have children with her?\u201d Meitin frowns. \u201cThey\u2019d turn out looking rather dead. And her table manners! I thought the Institute had the foreign ones trained well?\u201d\n \u201cShe will adapt.\u201d Equivocating. \u201cAnd she is unique. I don\u2019t think I could have found anyone like her at the university or through any of your friends, or . . . \u201d\n Her mother sniffs. \u201cAn acquired taste, I\u2019m sure. Well, your choices are your own and you\u2019re a woman grown. At least she\u2019s educated, I suppose.\u201d\n Heilui refrains from pointing out that as a biochemist, Kerttu\u2019s credentials are more impressive than most. Instead she watches her wife keep the envelopes out of the children\u2019s reach in one hand, distributing them with the other to the niece or nephew who has approximated a correct pronunciation of Aunt Kerttu.\n Over the next weeks Kerttu drifts uneasily within the family home, colliding with or grazing past elders. She does not succeed in endearing herself to them, though Heilui notes with relief that the children have taken a liking to Kerttu, for her occidental novelty if nothing else. Any time she has a free moment, Kerttu would obsessively spend it on the simulation.\n Heilui monitors Kerttu\u2019s progress, trying to use the map of her wife\u2019s virtual wanderings to create an image that would pierce the inscrutable, remote shell. A crucial piece that would make the Kerttu she is seeing cohere with the Kerttu the mass murderer who created weapons that destroyed the shattered continent, the war criminal. Often she thinks of asking, Did you understand what you were doing? At the beginning, she mustn\u2019t have, a prodigy whose supple intelligence was exploited, whose mind was slowly conditioned to regard her work as normal.\n Even then it is difficult to be afraid of Kerttu, who inhabits Heilui\u2019s life with the soft focus of a ghost. Difficult to connect her with those atrocities, the solidity of statistics and the hard industrial edges of war. But then it is difficult to connect the shattered continent\u2014smooth and pretty while it lived\u2014with its history of dialects born and annexed, its first contacts negotiated through a language of exploitation and expansion.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been distant. Am I boring you?\u201d Kerttu asks one evening as they share a dinner out in the city.\n \u201cCertainly not,\u201d Heilui says, laughing. \u201cYou have been nothing but delightful.\u201d\n Kerttu cuts her pasta into fine, thin slices, scraping off the layer of plum sauce. The restaurant purports to serve the cuisines of the shattered continent, though perhaps less authentically than Kerttu is used to. \u201cI don\u2019t think your family would agree, though I\u2019ve made efforts.\u201d\n \u201cMy family is your family too.\u201d Heilui rests her chin on her hand. \u201cSome of them you\u2019ll never win over, it\u2019s just how they are. There have been feuds where siblings couldn\u2019t forgive each other on their deathbeds. Lan elders are hard to please, no doubt about that.\u201d\n \u201cExcept you are harder still. You haven\u2019t . . . \u201d A frown. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked anything of me. Yet you must have bought me to fulfill a function, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to satisfy the fantasy of possessing a person whole and entire. You haven\u2019t done anything to exert your ownership.\u201d\n \u201cI like you just the way you are. Is that so hard to believe?\u201d She glances at her shell, taking a sip of honeyed lime. Expecting to hear her interrogator\u2019s voice again. Even today she remains ignorant of the woman\u2019s name or rank. Black ops. Counter-terrorism. \u201cWould you like to try the simulation in immersive mode, Kerttu? You need a headset and will have to plug into the server I\u2019ve got at home. Not perfect, but perhaps . . . ?\u201d\n Kerttu\u2019s breath hitches, audibly, as though that idea has shocked her pulse to a halt. \u201cI would love nothing more. You do me too much kindness.\u201d\n \u201cNot at all\u2014we\u2019ll immerse together, yes? You can grade me on the simulation.\u201d\n Several nights later, she starts awake to a hand over hers, long-fingered and tentative. Blearily she sits up to find Kerttu kneeling by her bed, a shadow dressed in gossamer lace. \u201cDoctor.\u201d Kerttu\u2019s voice comes petal-soft. \u201cWill you invite me in?\u201d\n Wide awake now, Heilui rubs at her eyes and stares at her wife, then at the bed on the other end of their shared room. \u201cI think you misunderstand. I\u2019m not\u2014what\u2019s between us doesn\u2019t have to be a transaction, not like that.\u201d\n Kerttu\u2019s hand withdraws. \u201cI should earn my keep, my care. I have said before that it\u2019s no ordeal\u2014unless I hold so little appeal?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d Heilui scoots inward, making room. \u201cCome in. We can sleep together, in the most literal sense.\u201d\n \u201cLike sisters?\u201d A trick of filtered moonlight makes it seem as though ice crystals have caught on Kerttu\u2019s eyelashes. A snow-woman of Jatbun myth, visiting in the night to drink her lover\u2019s spirit.\n \u201cLike wife and wife. Not all marriages need to be heat and desire. Or at least that\u2019s not what I want. If it\u2019s what you . . . you can find others for that. I wouldn\u2019t mind. But for me\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Exhaled surprise. \u201cI see, I think.\u201d\n Kerttu climbs in beside her, awkward, hesitating. A sigh loosens from her lips as she settles in against Heilui\u2019s warmth and her arm snakes over, one hand splayed on Heilui\u2019s stomach. \u201cIs this all right, Doctor?\u201d Asked as though she fears she might singe Heilui with that much contact, that much closeness.\n She laces her fingers through Kerttu\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely.\u201d\n They spend the night like that, entwined. They spend the next likewise, and the next after, learning the rhythm of each other\u2019s breath, the curve of each other\u2019s spine and the width of each other\u2019s waist. A nascent dialect of touch, a first contact negotiated through comfort. A slow formation of matrimony like the founding of a country, while Heilui swallows back the secret code of guilt.\n The first time they stand in front of the server together is a clear morning where icicles crackle on the window like chimes. The simulator box is built of blueshift alloy, radiant with cold, an artifact of the world\u2019s ruin and its eternal winter. With a command Heilui logs in and draws out two headsets. One she turns over to Kerttu, the other she slips around her own temple, a mesh with the texture of satin.\n \u201cAnything particular you\u2019d like to see?\u201d she asks.\n \u201cThe city.\u201d Kerttu touches the headset\u2019s lattice. \u201cThe club.\u201d\n Within the offspring of Heilui\u2019s thought, cities throng the shattered continent like firmaments lit up in their thousands. But she knows from watching her wife which one Kerttu means\u2014the city of her birth, the capital of her native land.\n The program pushes under their skin, flares across their senses, a susurration of colors and ice. Then they are side by side in the Tavastia, backstage. Darkened interior, hexagon walls dressed in facets and prism coins. Overhead, mannequins sway gently, many-jointed arachnid limbs painted in patterns of cracked granite.\n Kerttu pushes at the mannequins, making them clack. At her height they are in easy reach; she strokes their bald heads and thumbs their ovoid eye sockets. \u201cMy mother always longed to sing here. I don\u2019t remember her face, her voice, even her name. At six she sold me to the syndicate. I fetched a good price\u2014a mind such as I own doesn\u2019t come by every day\u2014and I wonder if she ever got her wish, to perform on a Tavastia stage. The first ten years I was kept entirely in the citadel to be imprinted for loyalty. By the time I was allowed to leave, she was gone. Or didn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Heilui says before she can stop herself.\n \u201cNo need, Doctor. My mother, she wasn\u2019t an educated or well-off woman. The syndicate gave me a life of ease and refinement, my intelligence nurtured and honed to its utter best. Had my mother raised me according to her means, today I\u2019d be just another refugee in the camps, if I even survived.\u201d Kerttu clasps her hands behind her back\u2014in the virtuality she wears not her grieving black but a peridot shirt and gray trousers, an overcoat in duochrome indigo. \u201cThere are no people here.\u201d\n She follows her wife to the stage. It is full of unmanned instruments made from jagged blades and razorglass tendons. The floor is strobe-lit but empty of dancers; puppets sit by the side, prim and inanimate. \u201cAnything I populate this world with would just be automatons\u2014as complex a set of heuristics as I can buy, but they wouldn\u2019t emulate human behavior with any degree of verisimilitude. I\u2019ve thought of modeling you, actually.\u201d\n \u201cI hope you\u2019ll agree that it is not hubris but fact that makes me point out I\u2019m not exactly a population average. Not culturally, not in disposition, not in politics. Modeling those from the camps would likely yield better results.\u201d\n \u201cA population comprised entirely of averages would be terribly unrealistic, but I take your point.\u201d\n Kerttu tugs at her sleeve as though to test whether the physics engine holds up to scrutiny. \u201cI have a request to make of you, Doctor. You may believe me ungrateful\u2014\u201d\n \u201cPlease,\u201d Heilui says. \u201cI\u2019ve no reason to think that.\u201d\n \u201cMay I go into the city on my own? I wish to familiarize myself with its ligatures and arteries, to find my own path climbing its ribs and vertebrae all sharp with salt. I wish to know this island where I will spend the rest of my life as your wife.\u201d\n Heilui\u2019s pulse picks up. \u201cYou hardly need my permission. Your shell should be loaded with guidance routines, but if you run into any trouble you only need to call me.\u201d\n \u201cYou are far more generous a client than I could ever dream of.\u201d Kerttu makes again that ancient bow, as elegant as it is incongruous with her outfit. Heilui realizes with a start that no matter the correctness of her gesture, no matter her fluency in Gwongdungwa, Kerttu will never fit quite right.\n On Kerttu\u2019s initial excursions, Heilui refrains from trailing her. Her wife comes home late each time; Heilui never asks questions and simply waits in bed, her arms bangled in moonlight. When Kerttu has bathed and changed she would come to card her fingers through Heilui\u2019s hair, root to tip, until they fall asleep.\n It is on Kerttu\u2019s fifth outing that Heilui tracks her\u2014a bite of conscience, a twist of shame. She monitors her wife\u2019s wanderings through markets that snake up pagodas, through secret streets behind amber pavilions, past the honeycombs of waterfront gardens where hybrid peacocks strut in sunset trails. Heilui tells herself Kerttu is monitored in any case, but she can\u2019t get rid of the certainty that she\u2019s committing a small betrayal.\n When Heilui at last follows her wife in person, it is down the harbor where beaked ferries knife the waters to white ribbons. She sits on the mezzanine of a floating restaurant, watching the world through sea spray. Watching as Kerttu enters the planetarium in her black keipou. Soon a man in the same shade follows her. Tall like Kerttu and just as colorless, a creature of her race and nation, raised on snow nova-bright. Heilui studies him: he is gaunt to the point of starvation but well-dressed, hair a few shades darker than Kerttu\u2019s, a skull of cadaverous planes. In the Institute, no doubt his caretakers would have warmed his features with cosmetics to make him less startling to prospective clients.\n The two do not leave together; the man lingers behind, his gaze intent on Kerttu as she exits. From this far Heilui cannot appraise his expression\u2014those harsh angles make him, like Kerttu, difficult to read\u2014but she thinks he seems painfully lost. As much as a dangerous terrorist can seem lost. She tries to imagine him as the shadow behind assassinations of heads of state, the shadow behind the sales of private armies and weaponry and untold destruction. But as with Kerttu, she can only see an ordinary man. Foreign, but merely mortal. He doesn\u2019t even sport the corpse-butterfly tattoo anywhere that she can glimpse.\n A wanted man who surfaces, exposing himself, just to retrieve Heilui\u2019s wife.\n The second time he comes for Kerttu, it is on a rooftop maze.\n An art installment writ large, the maze is composed\u2014syllabaric symphony\u2014of elemental strands: wood and metal, fire and earth, and water to complete the quintet. Batik lions move against jade tortoises on a steam tapestry. Patchwork topiaries flourish on inked wires and luminous nesting dolls. Guidance materializes as a calligraphic girl, torso and limbs all made of brushstrokes, shedding proverbs and verses to give Heilui directions. She waits for the creature to begin whispering in a mild human contralto, but it remains only rote and routes. Overhead, starlings flit from candle-roof to platinum bough.\n By the time Heilui reaches Kerttu, the girl is down to quartered ink and halved characters.\n She takes cover behind a spread of bronze longma and marble rabbits. And there they are, a tableau like theater-dolls awaiting an audience: he a statue in black from neck to ankle, elongated limbs sheathed in crisp, expensive tailoring. Kerttu is seated on a bench of braided rime and gridded kites, her hair a pale corona. As if given life by Heilui\u2019s spectating gaze, Kerttu stirs to motion and turns away from him. On her lap she holds the kintsugi bowl. \u201cYes,\u201d she is saying, \u201cI imagine the bowl holds enough genetic material with which to forge identity templates and authenticate my release from Institute trackers.\u201d\n \u201cGood.\u201d His voice is a scratch of stone chipping at wood. He runs a knuckle down his lapel, smoothing the impeccable fabric, a nervous tic. \u201cThat should suffice. I\u2019ll contact you again when I\u2019ve made the necessary arrangements.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n The man\u2019s hand slows then goes still, as of an automaton winding down. \u201cAre you afraid, Kerttu? I\u2019ve never known you for a coward.\u201d\n She looks up, her gaze ensnaring his, the gravity of a pyre drawing in moths. Heilui has learned her wife\u2019s moods and in that moment she knows there\u2019s no hesitation. Kerttu\u2019s corneas seem like lamp-glass to a flame, small but absolute. \u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid. I\u2019m just not leaving with you.\u201d\n A gunshot like a soldier\u2019s final breath. An eruption of starlings, crying out.\n The man falls, too fast for someone who should be bird-light, for a body that ought to float like gossamer or shredded ghosts. Where his blood touches Kerttu\u2019s clothes it does not show; where it lands on Kerttu\u2019s head it beads ruby-vivid against the snowdrift of her hair, the white slope of her brow.\n Bursts of communication, armored men and women spilling from between the maze\u2019s strands: a rush of black, acid tides. They collect the man\u2019s body, quick and efficient, folding him into a casket. A puppet returning to its box.\n Between all this, Kerttu\u2019s expression never changes, as though his death belongs to someone else.\n A day later, Heilui receives a copy of her dossier. It has been wiped clean as if nothing has ever happened, as though she\u2019s never been made to sit shivering in a metal chair, to answer question after question. To single out faces for betrayal. The copy deletes itself after one read. She doesn\u2019t hear from her interrogator; she doesn\u2019t expect she ever will. A vulgar touch\u2014several sums transferred into her account, absurdly large, acrimoniously transactional. She doesn\u2019t return them, knowing she can\u2019t afford the luxury of pride.\n She finds her wife kneeling before the server, already plugged in. She follows.\n The church is carved from solid rock, a copper-roofed globe drenched in bronze evening. The floor murmurs quartz canticles underfoot. Kerttu is enclosed in a pebble-rounded pew, a carpet of white furs and ice crystals mounded at her bare feet. \u201cI was never religious,\u201d she says without turning, \u201cbut I liked Temppeliaukio. It is\u2014was\u2014a good hideout when I wanted to think. When I wanted peace, but usually it was too crowded. In a way, you\u2019ve created the perfect version of my country for me.\u201d\n \u201cKerttu\u2014\u201d Heilui draws a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n Her wife turns around. Rime cracks at her movement, sloughing off her shoulders in flecks and teardrops. \u201cThere\u2019s no need, Doctor. I always knew I was released from the Institute for a purpose and he was a priority target. Of all his surviving associates, I made the best bait. I\u2019m only curious why you did it. Is it simply patriotism? Frightening as his reputation was, I don\u2019t think he would have resumed his work. He meant to lie low, disappear. Change his face again and become just an ordinary man.\u201d\n \u201cFive years ago occidental terrorists infiltrated my university and I got close to one of them, a woman I thought I could marry. She . . . made use of me to access our archives, I don\u2019t remember anymore what data she got. I was arrested as a potential accessory and though found innocent, it scarred my records. This\u2014I was offered amnesty. My name cleared.\u201d Within the virtuality she is not subjected to involuntary reactions, the tyranny of cortisol and serotonin, but she\u2019s accustomed to configuring her avatar to reflect her real body as much as possible. Her throat is sore and thick. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you? Go with him.\u201d\n Kerttu folds her hands. Snow blooms, unmelting, on her knuckles like wedding rings. \u201cUltimately it is a question of whose property I am. What did he offer? A life on the run, dogged each step by terror. The past is past. There\u2019s no use resurrecting a hill of ashes. The dead do not come back. The arrow of time doesn\u2019t reverse.\u201d\n Heilui purses her mouth, opens it. Exhales. \u201cMy contract with the Institute isn\u2019t permanent. There\u2019s been no further . . . instructions. After what\u2019s happened, you should have this choice. You can go back to the Institute and they\u2019ll find you another client.\u201d\n \u201cIs that what you want, Heilui?\u201d\n A painful-sweet wrench in her chest: like love, like cardiac arrest. It is strategically placed and cannot be inadvertent, but even so. \u201cYou\u2019ve never called me by name before, like that, ever.\u201d\n \u201cThe Institute appears to be done with me. I\u2019m of no further use to them and therefore I\u2019m now granted freedom, after a fashion, as long as they can track me and I\u2019m tethered to a client.\u201d Kerttu looks, unblinking, at Heilui with her aquatic eyes. \u201cA future can be had and a new life can be built. That is what you offer me and I\u2019d like to take you up on it.\u201d\n Logical. Transactional, as this has been from the beginning. And yet Heilui finds herself smiling. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. And if you were gone, I\u2019d miss you. I\u2019ll have to talk my family around, but my mothers at least I think I can convince.\u201d\n \u201cI will do my best to be the daughter-in-law they can tolerate. They will be my family, my mothers.\u201d\n Heilui laughs, surprising herself, the sound of a scale tipping in her heart. \u201cSo they would. I never asked you properly before, did I, so\u2014Kerttu, will you be my wife?\u201d\n Kerttu gathers Heilui in her arms and kisses her brow, soft and warm. \u201cYes. Let\u2019s try to make this work together.\u201d\n At their feet, the frost of Kerttu\u2019s country thaws: a pool clear as the first water of spring, blue-green and sharp with salt.\n Out in the world of mortal flesh and unbearable history, on the island surrounded by storm and sea, the occidental bride never dons black again.\n Benjanun Sriduangkaew writes love letters to strange cities, beautiful bugs, and the future.

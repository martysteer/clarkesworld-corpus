Some fantasy fiction magazine guidelines even warn writers against sending \u201cyour most recent D&D adventure in prose.\u201d Yet the gap between role-playing games and speculative fiction is narrow, and many similarities exist between the art of crafting fantastic fiction and the imaginative play of RPGs.\n We decided to ask some modern fantasists about their experiences and thoughts regarding the games they played and their vocation of letters. We think Mr. Gygax would be pleased with their responses.\n Jeff VanderMeer, two-time World Fantasy Award-winning author of Shriek: An Afterword, began playing D&D in grammar school. \u201cI was a Dungeon Master, but I was soon putting too much time into details that had nothing to do with the games. Basically, I was world-building as background to stories and novels.\u201d While enjoying the game, VanderMeer felt that it took away from his writing time. \u201cI enjoyed the adventures, but it was a bit of a relief to go on to fiction\u2014that\u2019s really where I wanted to be, in terms of creating things. Ultimately, playing D&D seemed like a waste of time. It wasn\u2019t, but it seemed like I could be creating something of my own and not just playing around in someone else\u2019s universe. One day I looked up and D&D was in the past and I was a fiction writer.\u201d\n Paul Witcover would agree with VanderMeer on gaming being a time-suck from writing, but gaming was also an inspiration. Witcover\u2019s novel Tumbling After features a D&D-type game and explores \u201cthe philosophical and existential implications of gaming.\u201d The novel\u2019s twin protagonists, Jack and Jill Doone, share an almost telepathic connection. While vacationing with their family on the Delaware shore, they become play-testers for their Uncle Jimmy\u2019s role-playing game, Mutes & Norms. After a near death experience, Jack finds himself developing unique powers. Soon his story and that of his sister becomes entwined with that of Kestrel, a mutant from the future whose world resembles that of their Uncle\u2019s game.\n \u201cIf the act of imagining something could cause that imaginary thing to exist in some alternate universe,\u201d Witcover wondered, \u201cthen there is a moral dimension to imagination and creation, a responsibility. We are responsible for what we imagine, what we create.\u201d However, he went on to caution writers by saying: \u201cGaming and game designs are analogous to certain elements in the writing process, and can thus be helpful for writers, but gaming is not writing. Too many writers approach writing as if it were simply game design. Maybe I\u2019m old-fashioned, but such books leave me cold. I would rather play than read them.\u201d\n On the other hand, Tim Pratt, multiple award-nominated author of Blood Engines, enjoyed absorbing the fantasy of RPG source books alongside other reading habits. \u201cI read Stephen King novels and Ravenloft sourcebooks, I read Deities and Demigods and Charles de Lint stories, I read Unearthed Arcana and X-Men comics. I didn\u2019t make much of a distinction, and often read source material for games I never even played\u2014and in some of my early teen stories I flat-out stole characters and monsters from D&D sources (which is only fair, since they stole many of the same characters and monsters from genre fiction originally\u2014circle of life!).\u201d\n This amalgam of fiction and source books not only fueled his imagination but gave him early experience in storytelling techniques. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of crossing genres a lot in my work, and I think I got that from RPGs, largely . . . RIFTs combined fairy tales and robots and mythological monsters and aliens, and that kind of freedom and weirdness always rubbed me the right way. Creating RPGs helped me become comfortable with doing big, crazy, wild things\u2014which is a definite advantage in writing fantasy fiction.\u201d Pratt\u2019s writing would attest to that. His collections Little Gods and Hart & Boot feature stories that play fast and loose with elements of the fantastic and the mundane. Punks, magic, detectives, hell-hounds, and ghosts abound in stories set more often than not in a mimetic world. However, the benefit was not entirely in subject matter. Pratt mentioned another skill learned through gaming. \u201cIt also helped me learn to improvise on the fly, and, strangely enough, taught me that plot derives from character\u2014you can create a setting and plan an adventure, but the people playing their characters will make their own unexpected decisions, and push the game in new directions.\u201d Pratt also had to put games down to devout time to his writing career.\n Catherynne M. Valente\u2019s Orphan\u2019s Tales series dives deep into the mythic well that inspired Leiber, Howard, Tolkien, and Vance, all of whom were seminal influence on Gygax. However, RPGs had no influence on her early development as a writer. \u201cI think whether or not you get into it at a young age is dependent on having that one friend who\u2019s really into it, and I never did.\u201d She did play a lot of console games such as Final Fantasy and learned the mechanics and terminology through them; so when her fianc\u00e9 lured her into pen and paper gaming she already knew much of the lexicon. What made her reluctant was the effect this might have on her writing: \u201cI spend most days coming up with characters and back-stories. I didn\u2019t want to do much more of that.\u201d She also feels that \u201ca lot of fantasy novels take far too much from RPG tropes. They read exactly like campaigns\u2014densely detailed weapons and political situations, flat characters who are little more than their races and either \u2018spunk\u2019 or \u2018sullen\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to be tainted by that, to let it into my head on a weekly basis.\u201d\n Ultimately, these concerns became a non-issue for Valente. As simply a player in someone else\u2019s game she can enjoy the entertainment of playing and stomping monsters without any drain on her own creativity. If she were GMing, however, she believes it would be an entirely different story: \u201cI don\u2019t think I could justify expending material on a campaign setting that could go into a novel. That would be incredibly hard not to do.\u201d\n The major problem RPG-influenced authors face, Valente argues, is an inability to identify clich\u00e9. \u201cThe world of RPGs is more forgiving of clich\u00e9 than the world of literature is. Familiar settings and characters help players to locate their function and acclimate to surroundings. . . . To create a truly wonderful piece of fiction, you have to aim above the familiar, the tired, and the overused. As an author, it\u2019s my job to have a discerning eye: what is game, and what is book? What is vivid and visceral, and what is clich\u00e9? I don\u2019t feel RPGing affects those things, but that is probably because I am a player, not a GM.\u201d (Incidentally, she plays a blunderbuss-wielding tiefling chaos mage in the D&D Planescape setting\u2014using the Heroes system, so no levels.)\n Unlike Valente, Jay Lake, Campbell award-winning author of Mainspring, found D&D a great companion to his imagination, perhaps because it entered his life at a young age. \u201cRPGs developed my ability to create narrative flow. They also reinforced my already strong love of fantasy. All of that fed the nascent writer in my head . . . they\u2019re also good for learning to get in character, a valuable trait for any writer. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, they reinforce your sense of wonder. That is the key to genre fiction.\u201d\n Lake also sees the influence of table-top games being significantly different than video or online RPGs. The environment of meat-space RPGs is, like that of a book, live in the mind. \u201cTabletop RPGs put most of the creative effort on the player, who must visualize the characters and their environment. Online RPGs feed the player a high-impact visualization of the characters and their environment. . . . I think the effort of worldbuilding which players of my generation went through has been replaced by the immersive experience. That in turn has substantially changed the relationship between RPGs and the creative process. Whether that change is for the better or the worse remains to be seen. I am suspicious of it, but that might just be middle age talking.\u201d\n Unlike the authors mentioned, Tim Waggoner, surrealist-horror author of Cross Country, also writes novels based on RPG properties. He sees a connection between the character and environment of RPGs and print storytelling. RPGs \u201cshowed me that the richer the world your characters live in, the more story possibilities there are. When I create worlds of my own \u2014 even worlds that are closely aligned with contemporary reality \u2014 I try to develop them in as much detail as possible. Gamers read a lot, so interacting with other readers, learning about what they were reading, exposed me to different writers.\u201d\n Waggoner also agrees with Lake that RPGs provided early flexing of his narrative muscles by creating characters and dealing with exposition. \u201cAs a player, you know a great deal about the world from the various manuals and guides. But your character only knows whatever is part of his or her background, and discovers anything else as the game plays out. I learned a ton about how much information to give readers and exactly when to give it to them from gaming.\u201d As with Pratt, the improvisation of working with players with their own frames of references was also instructive. \u201cCharacters can make wrong assumptions and make bad choices. So many writers plot out a story, march their characters through the plot, and then reach the outcome. They forget to leave room for the unpredictable, for the joy of surprise. Gaming taught me that what goes wrong for characters makes for the most interesting stories.\u201d\n For Black Gate publisher John O\u2019Neil, Gygax and his game acted as a catalyst for the interest in the fantasy adventure for which the magazine is known. \u201cFor someone discovering much of this for the first time,\u201d O\u2019Neil said, \u201c[D&D] was an embarrassment of riches. All of it contributed to a fascination with pulp fiction in general, especially the period from 1930-1950.\u201d Like others he admits that game-mastering served as his apprenticeship in storytelling and he offers some advice for writers gleaned from the gaming table. \u201cNo one cares about your 80-pages of background description. Give them something to care about before your start to pull back the curtain on all that homework.\n Black Gate managing editor Howard A. Jones notes that lots of new writers, weaned on D&D, may not know the fantasy antecedents of the game\u2019s well-known tropes: \u201cThe author doesn\u2019t realize that the fire and forget spell list came from Vance, or that the elves and hobbits came from Tolkien or that thieves\u2019 guilds came from Lankhmar because they\u2019ve never read the source material . . . These games wouldn\u2019t exist if Gygax and Arneson hadn\u2019t loved the source material.\u201d\n Arthur C. Clarke award-winner China Mieville has had an unabashed love of RPGs since he was a kid. While not a conscious influence on his desire to be a writer, RPGs had a powerful effect on his subconscious in what he referred to as the \u201cawe/system\u201d dichotomy. \u201cMany of us who love the fantastic, particularly the generic fantastic (as opposed to, say, what you could loosely call the \u2019haute literary\u2019 fantastic (scare quotes deliberate) of Gogol, Bulgakov, Kafka, etc.) is an oscillation between two aesthetic gravitational pulls. One is what is sometimes called the sensawunda. From this perspective, what draws us to the fantastic (including sf and, in a \u2019bad-numinous\u2019 version, horror), is the awe at the unrepresentable. The vasty strangeness, the \u2019Real\u2019 (in Lacanian terms), that which is definitionally beyond our power to successfully represent. You see that in everything from the appearance of Cthulhu to the apotheotic monolith of 2001 to the sudden Becoming at the end of Tiger! Tiger! That\u2019s the side of the fantastic that puts it in a lineage with the visionary and ecstatic.\n At the other end of the pole, however, is \u201cour obsessive love for systematization, for categorization and rigid and rigorous taxonomy. This you see in the profusion of bestiaries, of spurious encyclopedias, and above all in the \u2019stats\u2019 and rules of fantasy RPGs. A lot of what we think of as genre fantasy seems to me a fascinating crossbreed of those contradictory pulls. What we love about Cthulhu is that it is beyond our ken, as Lovecraft repeatedly points out. Then, in an act of Promethean heroic vulgarization, the Call of Cthulhu RPG neatly laid out Cthulhu\u2019s \u2019Stats\u2019 - Str, 100, or whatever it is. This is not a dis of RPGs. My point is that that desire to systematize even the fantastic, the point of which is to evade systematization, is a kind of geek honor, a ludicrous and incredibly seductive and even creative project, an almost majestic point-missing, that in missing the point, does something new.\u201d\n Mieville views his own work as oscillating between these poles. \u201cI see that tension between wanting to remain true to what I think of as a M. John Harrisonian fidelity to the inherently unstable and evasive nature of the fantastic \u2014 his Viriconium, after all, changes its names and its boundaries, and its refusal to submit to RPG-style rules is part of what makes it magnificent \u2014 and the passionate D&D-style desire to rulify and systematize the world \u2014 to have stable maps, a set of bestiaries, a timeline, etc. (Perdido Street Station includes a party of cheerfully psychopathic and amoral player-characters, as an affectionate internal swipe at my inspirations.) For me that system/awe dichotomy is key to genre fantasy, and the systematization of the system half of that dyad is the RPG-tradition\u2019s great feat. We can react against it, surrender to it, argue with it, or whatever, but it\u2019s part of the mulch in which we grow.\u201d\n Finally, when asked what other fond memories he might have of the game, Mieville made sure to state: \u201cThey left me with an intense crush on Morgan Ironwolf, iconic character from the D&D basic rules. I cannot be held responsible for the libidinal drives of my 11-year-old self.\u201d\n Of such things fantasy literature is made.\n Justin Howe was born and raised in Massachusetts.

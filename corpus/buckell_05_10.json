Too much walking about just exacerbates the situation anyway. So I was nervous when a stationeer appeared at my cubby and knocked on the door.\n I slid out and stood in front of the polished, skeletal robot.\n \u201cAlex Mosette?\u201d it asked.\n There was no sense in lying. The stationeer had already scanned my face. It was just looking for voice print verification. \u201cYes, I\u2019m Alex,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThe harbormaster wants to see you.\u201d\n I swallowed. \u201cHe could have sent me a message.\u201d\n \u201cI am here to escort you.\u201d The robot held out a tinker-toy arm, digits pointed along the hallway.\n Space in orbit came at a premium. Bottom-rung types like me slept in cubbies stacked ten high along the hallway. On my back in the cubby, watching entertainment shuffled in from the planets, they made living on a space station sound exotic and exciting.\n It was if you were further up the rung. I\u2019d been in those rooms: places with wasted space. Furniture. Room to stroll around in.\n That was exotic.\n Getting space in outer space was far down my list of needs.\n First was air. Then food.\n Anything else was pure luxury.\n The harbormaster stared out into space, and I silently waited at the door to Operations, hoping that if I remained quiet he wouldn\u2019t notice.\n Ops hung from near the center of the megastructure of the station. A blister stuck on the end of a long tunnel. You could see the station behind us: the miles-long wheel of exotic metals rotating slowly.\n No gravity in Ops, or anywhere in the center. Spokes ran down from the wheel to the center, and the center was where ships docked and were serviced and so on.\n So I hung silently in the air, long after the stationeer flitted off to do the harbormaster\u2019s bidding, wondering what happened next.\n \u201cYou\u2019re overdrawn,\u201d the harbormaster said after a needle-like ship with long feathery vanes slipped underneath us into the docking bays.\n He turned to face me, even though his eyes had been hollowed out long ago. Force of habit. His real eyes were now every camera, or anything mechanical that could see.\n The harbormaster moved closer. The gantry around him was motorized, a long arm moving him anywhere he wanted in the room.\n Hundreds of cables, plugged into his scalp like hair, bundled and ran back along the arm of the gantry. Hoses moved effluvia out. More hoses ran purified blood, and other fluids, back in.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I stammered. \u201cTraffic is light. And requests have dropped off. I\u2019ve taken classes. Even language lessons . . . \u201d I stopped when I saw the wizened hand raise, palm up.\n \u201cI know what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d The harbormaster\u2019s sightless sockets turned back to the depths of space outside. The hardened skin of his face showed few emotions, his artificial voice was toneless. \u201cYou would not have been allowed to overdraw if you hadn\u2019t made good faith efforts.\u201d\n \u201cFor which,\u201d I said, \u201cI am enormously appreciative.\u201d\n \u201cThat ship that just arrived brings with it a choice for you,\u201d the harbormaster continued without acknowledging what I\u2019d just said. \u201cI cannot let you overdraw any more if you stay on station, so I will have to put you into hibernation. To pay for hibernation and your air debt I would buy your contract. You\u2019d be woken for guaranteed work. I\u2019d take a percentage. You could buy your contract back out, once you had enough liquidity.\u201d\n That was exactly what I\u2019d been dreading. But he\u2019d indicated an alternate. \u201cMy other option?\u201d\n He waved a hand, and a holographic image of the ship I\u2019d just seen coming in to dock hung in the air. \u201cThey\u2019re asking for a professional Friend.\u201d\n \u201cFor their ship?\u201d Surprise tinged my question. I wasn\u2019t crew material. I\u2019d been shipped frozen to the station, just another corpsicle. People like me didn\u2019t stay awake for travel. Not enough room.\n The harbormaster shrugged pallid shoulders. \u201cThey will not tell me why. I had to sign a nondisclosure agreement just to get them to tell me what they wanted.\u201d\n I looked at the long ship. \u201cI\u2019m not a fuckbot. They know that, right?\u201d\n \u201cThey know that. They reiterated that they do not want sexual services.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll be outside the station. Outside your protection. It could still be what they want.\u201d\n \u201cThat is a risk. How much so, I cannot model for you.\u201d The harbormaster snapped his fingers, and the ship faded away. \u201cBut the contractors have extremely high reputational scores on past business dealings. They are freelance scientists: biology, botany, and one linguist.\u201d\n So they probably didn\u2019t want me as a pass-around toy.\n Probably.\n \u201cRape amendments to the contract?\u201d I asked. I was going to be on a ship, unthawed, by myself, with crew I\u2019d never met. I had to think about the worst.\n \u201cProhibitive. Although, accidental loss of life is not quite as high, which means I\u2019d advise lowering the former so that there is no temptation to murder you after a theoretical rape to evade the higher contract payout.\u201d\n \u201cFuck,\u201d I sighed.\n \u201cWould you like to peruse their reputation notes?\u201d the harbormaster asked. And for a moment, I thought maybe the harbormaster sounded concerned.\n No. He was just being fair. He\u2019d spent two hundred years of bargaining with ships for goods, fuel, repair, services. Fair was built-in, the half-computer half-human creature in front of me was all about fair. Fair got you repeat business. Fair got you a wide reputation.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s the offer?\u201d\n \u201cHalf a point on the package,\u201d the harbormaster said.\n \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know what the package is, or how long it will take . . . or anything.\u201d I bit my lip.\n \u201cThey assured me that half a point would pay off your debt and then some. It shouldn\u2019t take more than a year.\u201d\n A year. For half a percent. Half a percent of what? It could be cargo they were delivering. Or, seeing as it was a crew of scientists, it could be some project they were working on.\n All of which just raised more questions.\n Questions I wouldn\u2019t have answers to unless I signed up. I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s it, then? No loans? No extensions?\u201d\n The harbormaster sighed. \u201cI answer to the Gheda shareholders who built and own this complex. I have already stretched my authority to give you a month\u2019s extension. The debt has to be called. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n I looked out at the darkness of space out beyond Ops. \u201cShit choices either way.\u201d\n The harbormaster said nothing.\n I folded my arms. \u201cDo it.\u201d\n Journey by Gheda\n The docking arms had transferred the starship from the center structure\u2019s incoming docks down a spoke to a dock on one of the wheels. The entire ship, thanks to being spun along with the wheel of the station, had gravity.\n The starship was a quarter of a mile long. Outside: sleek and burnished smooth by impacts with the scattered dust of space at the stunning speeds it achieved. Inside, I realized I\u2019d boarded a creaky, old, outdated vehicle.\n Fiberwire spilled out from conduits, evidence of crude repair jobs. Dirt and grime clung to nooks and crannies. The air smelled of sweat and worst.\n A purple-haired man with all-black eyes met me at the airlock. \u201cYou are the Friend?\u201d he asked. He carried a large walking stick with him.\n \u201cYes.\u201d I let go of the rolling luggage behind me and bowed. \u201cI\u2019m Alex.\u201d\n He bowed back. More extravagantly than I did. Maybe even slightly mockingly. \u201cI\u2019m Oslo.\u201d Every time he shifted his walking stick, tiny grains of sand inside rattled and shifted about. He brimmed with impatience, and some regret in the crinkled lines of his eyes. \u201cIs this everything?\u201d\n I looked back at the single case behind me. \u201cThat is everything.\u201d\n \u201cThen welcome aboard,\u201d Oslo said, as the door to the station clanged shut. He raised the stick, and a flash of light blinded me.\n \u201cYou should have taken a scan of me before you shut the door,\u201d I said. The stick was more than it seemed. Those tiny rustling grains were generators, harnessing power for whatever tools were inside the device via kinetic motion. He turned around and started to walk away. I hurried to catch up.\n Oslo smiled, and I noticed tiny little fangs under his lips. \u201cYou are who you say you are, so everything ended up okay. Oh, and for protocol, the others aren\u2019t much into it either, by the way. Now, for my own edification, you are a hermaphrodite, correct?\u201d\n I flushed. \u201cI am what we Friends prefer to call bi-gendered, yes.\u201d Where the hell was Oslo from? I was having trouble placing his cultural conditionings and how I might adapt to interface with them. He was very direct, that was for sure.\n This gig might be more complicated than I thought.\n \u201cYour Friend training: did it encompass Compact cross-cultural training?\u201d\n I slowed down. \u201cIn theory,\u201d I said slowly, worried about losing the contract if they insisted on having someone with Compact experience.\n Oslo\u2019s regret dripped from his voice and movements. Was it regret that I didn\u2019t have the experience? Would I lose the contract, minutes into getting it? Or just regret that he couldn\u2019t get someone better? \u201cBut you\u2019ve never Friended an actual Compact drone?\u201d\n I decided to tell the truth. A gamble. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cToo bad.\u201d The regret sloughed off, to be replaced with resignation. \u201cBut we can\u2019t poke around asking for Friends with that specific experience, or one of our competitors might put two and two together. I recommend you brush up on your training during the trip out.\u201d\n He stopped in front of a large, metal door. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cHere is your room for the next three days.\u201d Oslo opened the large door to a five-by-seven foot room with a foldout bunk bed.\n My heart skipped a beat, and I put aside the fact that Oslo had avoided the question. \u201cThat\u2019s mine?\u201d\n \u201cYes. And the air\u2019s billed with our shipping contract, so you can rip your sensors off. There\u2019ll be no accounting until we\u2019re done.\u201d\n I got the sense Oslo knew what it was like to be in debt. I stepped into the room and turned all the way around. I raised my hands, placing them on each wall, and smiled.\n Oslo turned to go.\n \u201cWait,\u201d I said. \u201cThe harbormaster said you were freelance scientists. What do you do?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m the botanist,\u201d Oslo said. \u201cMeals are in the common passenger\u2019s galley. The crew of this ship is Gheda, of course, don\u2019t talk to or interact with them if you can help it. You know why?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d The last thing you wanted to do was make a Gheda think you were wandering around, trying to figure out secrets about their ships, or technology. I would stay in the approved corridors and not interact with them.\n The door closed in my suite, and I sat down with my small travel case, no closer to understanding what was going on than I had been on the station.\n I faced the small mirror by an even smaller basin and reached for the strip of black material stuck to my throat. Inside it, circuitry monitored my metabolic rate, number of breaths taken, volume of air taken in, and carbon dioxide expelled. All of it reported back to the station\u2019s monitors, constantly calculating my mean daily cost.\n It made a satisfying sound as I ripped it off.\n \u201cGheda are Gheda,\u201d I said later in the ship\u2019s artificial, alien day over reheated turkey strips in the passenger\u2019s galley. We\u2019d undocked. The old ship had shivered itself up to speed. \u201cBut Gheda flying around in a beat-up old starship, willing to take freelance scientists out to some secret destination: these are dangerous Gheda.\u201d\n Oslo had a rueful smile as he leaned back and folded his arms. \u201cCruzie says that our kind used to think our corporations were rapacious and evil before first contact. No one expected aliens to demand royalty payments for technology usage that had been independently discovered by us because the Gheda had previously patented that technology.\u201d\n \u201cI know. They hit non-compliant areas with asteroids from orbit.\u201d Unable to pay royalties, entire nations had collapsed into debtorship. \u201cWho\u2019s Cruzie?\u201d\n Oslo grimaced. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet her in two days. Our linguist. Bit of a historian, too. Loves old Earth shit.\u201d\n I frowned at his reaction. Conflicted, but with somewhat warm pleasure when he thought about her. A happy grimace. \u201cShe\u2019s an old friend of yours?\u201d\n \u201cOur parents were friends. They loved history. The magnificence of Earth. The legend that was. Before it got sold around. Before the Diaspora.\u201d That grimace again. But no warmth there.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t agree with their ideals?\u201d I guessed.\n I guessed well. Oslo sipped at a mug of tea, and eyed me. \u201cI\u2019m not your project, Friend. Don\u2019t dig too deep, because you just work for me. Save your empathy and psychiatry for the real subject. Understand?\u201d\n Too far, I thought. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And just what is my project? We\u2019re away from the station now; do you think you can risk being open with me?\u201d\n Oslo set his tea down. \u201cClever. Very clever, Friend. Yes, I was worried about bugs. We\u2019ve found a planet, with a unique ecosystem. There may be patentable innovations.\u201d\n I sat, stunned. Patents? I had points on the package. If I got points on a patent on some aspect of an alien biological system, a Gheda-approved patent, I\u2019d be rich.\n Not just rich, but like, nation-rich.\n Oslo sipped at his tea. \u201cThere\u2019s only one problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be intelligent life on the planet. If it\u2019s intelligent, it\u2019s a contact situation, and we have to turn it over to the Gheda. We get a fee, but no taste of the real game. We fail to report a contact situation and the Gheda find out, it\u2019s going to be a nasty scene. They\u2019ll kill our families, or even people you know, just to make the point that their interstellar law is inviolate. We have to file a claim the moment of discovery.\u201d\n I\u2019d heard hesitation in his voice. \u201cYou haven\u2019t filed yet, have you?\u201d\n \u201cI bet all the Gheda business creatures love having you watch humans they\u2019re settling a contract with, making sure they\u2019re telling the truth, you there to brief them on what their facial expressions are really showing.\u201d\n That stung. \u201cI\u2019d do the same for any human. And it isn\u2019t just contracts. Many hire me to pay attention to them, to figure them out, anticipate their needs.\u201d\n Oslo leered. \u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d\n I wasn\u2019t a fuckbot. I deflected the leering. \u201cSo tell me, Oslo, why I\u2019m risking my life, then?\u201d\n \u201cWe haven\u2019t filed yet because we honestly can\u2019t fucking figure out if the aliens are just dumb creatures, or intelligences like us,\u201d Oslo said.\n The Drone\n \u201cWelcome to the Screaming Kettle,\u201d said the woman who grabbed my bag without asking. She had dark brown skin and eyes, and black hair. Tattoos covered every inch of skin free of her clothing. Words in scripts and languages that I didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cThe Compact Drone is about to dock as well, we need you ready for it. Let\u2019s get your stuff stowed.\u201d\n We walked below skylights embedded in the top of the research station. A planet hung there: green and yellow and patchy. It looked like it was diseased with mold. \u201cIs that Ve?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cOslo get you up to speed?\u201d the woman asked.\n \u201cSomewhat. You\u2019re Cruzie, right?\u201d\n \u201cMaricruz. I\u2019m the linguist. I guess . . . you\u2019re stuck here with us. You can call me Cruzie too.\u201d We stopped in front of a room larger than the one on the ship. With two beds.\n I looked at the beds. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with a cubby, if it means getting my own space,\u201d I said.\n There was far more space here, vastly so. And yet, I was going to have to share it? It rankled. Even at the station, I hadn\u2019t had to share my space. This shoved me up against my own cultural normative values. Even in the most packed places in space, you needed a cubby of one\u2019s own.\n \u201cYou\u2019re here to Friend the Compact Drone,\u201d Cruzie said. \u201cIt\u2019ll need companionship at all times. Their contract requires it for the Drone\u2019s mental stability.\u201d\n \u201cOslo didn\u2019t tell me this.\u201d I pursed my lips. A fairly universal display of annoyance.\n And Cruzie read that well enough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. But it was a lie as well. She was getting annoyed and impatient. But screw it, as Oslo pointed out: I wasn\u2019t there for their needs. \u201cOslo wants us to succeed more than anything. Unlike his parents, he\u2019s not much into the glory that was humankind. He knows the only way we\u2019ll ever not be freelancers, scrabbling around for intellectual scraps found in the side alleys of technology for something we can use without paying the Gheda for the privilege, is to hit something big.\u201d\n \u201cSo he lied to me.\u201d My voice remained flat.\n \u201cHe left out truths that would have made you less willing to come.\u201d\n \u201cHe lied.\u201d\n Cruzie shut the door to my room. \u201cHe gave you points on the package, Friend. We win big, you do your job, you\u2019ll never have to check the balance on your air for the rest of your damned life. I heard you were in air debt, right?\u201d\n She\u2019d put me well in place. We both knew it. Cruzie smiled, a gracious winner\u2019s smile.\n \u201cIncoming!\u201d Someone yelled from around the bend in the corridor.\n \u201cI\u2019m not going to fuck the Drone,\u201d I told her levelly.\n Cruzie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do or don\u2019t do, as long as the Drone stays mentally stable and does its job for us. Points on the package, Alex. Points.\u201d\n Airlock alarms flashed and warbled, and the hiss of compressed air filled the antechamber\n \u201cThe incoming pod\u2019s not much larger than a cubby sleeper,\u201d Oslo said, his purple hair waving about as another burst of compressed air filled the antechamber. He smiled, fangs out beyond his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than the lander we have for exploring Ve ourselves, if we ever need to get down there. Can you imagine the ride? The only non-Gheda way of traveling!\u201d\n The last member of the team joined us. She looked over at me and nodded. Silvered electronic eyes glinted in the flash of the airlock warning lights. She flexed the jet black fingers of her artificial right hand absentmindedly as she waited for the doors to open. She ran the fingers of a real hand over her shaved head, then put them back in her utility jacket, covered with what seemed like hundreds of pockets and zippers.\n \u201cThat\u2019s Kepler,\u201d Cruzie said.\n The airlock doors opened. A thin, naked man stumbled out, dripping goopy blue acceleration gel with each step.\n For a moment his eyes flicked around, blinking.\n Then he started screaming.\n Oslo, Kepler, and Cruzie jumped back half a step from the naked man\u2019s arms. I stepped forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not fear, it\u2019s relief.\u201d\n The man grabbed me in a desperate hug, clinging to me, his hands patting my face, shoulders, as if reassuring himself someone was really standing in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I whispered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in there by yourself for days, with no contact of any sort. I understand.\u201d\n He was shivering in my grip, but I kept patting his back. I urged him to feel the press of contact between us. And reassurance. Calm.\n Eventually he calmed down, and then slowly let go of me.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cBeck.\u201d\n \u201cWelcome aboard, Beck,\u201d I said, looking over his shoulder at the scientists who looked visibly relieved.\n First things first.\n Beck got to the communications room. Back and forth verification on an uplink, and he leaned back against the chair in relief.\n \u201cThere\u2019s an uplink to the Hive,\u201d he said. \u201cAn hour of lag time to get as far back as the home system, but I\u2019m patched in.\u201d\n He tapped metal inserts on the back of his neck. His mind plugged in to the communications network, talking all the way back to the asteroid belt in the mother system, where the Compact\u2019s Hive thrived. Back there, Beck would always be in contact with it without a delay. In instant symbiosis with a universe of information that the Compact offered.\n A hive-mind of people, your core self subjugated to the greater whole.\n I shivered.\n Beck never moved more than half a foot away from me. Always close enough to touch. He kept reaching out to make sure I was there, even though he could see me.\n After walking around the research station for half an hour, we returned to our shared room.\n He sat on his bed, suddenly apprehensive. \u201cYou\u2019re the Friend, correct?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m lonely over here. Can you sleep by me?\u201d\n I walked over and sat next to him. \u201cI won\u2019t have sex with you. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m chemically neutered,\u201d Beck said as we curled up on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m a drone.\u201d\n As we lay there, I imagined thousands of Becks sleeping in rows in Hive dorms, body heat keeping the rooms warm.\n Half an hour later he suddenly sighed, like a drug addict getting a hit. \u201cThey hear me,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not alone.\u201d\n The Compact had replied to him.\n He relaxed.\n The room filled with a pleasant lavender scent. Was it something he\u2019d splashed on earlier? Or something a Compact drone released to indicate comfort?\n What\u2019s Human?\n \u201cThat,\u201d Kepler said, leaning back in a couch before a series of displays, \u201cis one of our remote-operated vehicles. We call them urchins.\u201d\n In the upper right hand screen before her, a small sphere with hundreds of wriggling legs rotated around. Then it scrabbled off down what looked like a dirt path.\n Cruzie swung into a similar couch. \u201cWe sterilize them in orbit, then drop them down encased in a heatshield. It burns away, then they drop down out of the sky with a little burst of a rocket to slow down enough.\u201d\n I frowned at one of the screens. Everything was shades of green and gray and black. \u201cIs that night vision?\u201d\n Oslo laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s Ve. The atmosphere is chlorinated. Green mists. Grey shadows. And black plants.\u201d\n The trees had giant, black leaves hanging low to the ground. Tubular trunks sprouted globes that spouted mist randomly as the urchin brushed past.\n \u201cVe\u2019s a small planet,\u201d Kepler said. \u201cLow gravity, but with air similar to what you would have seen on the mother world.\u201d\n \u201cEarth,\u201d Oslo corrected.\n \u201cBut unlike the mother world,\u201d Kepler continued, \u201cVe has high levels of chlorine. Somewhere in its history, a battle launched among the plants. Instead of specializing in oxygen to kill off the competition, and adapting to it over time, plant life here turned to chlorine as a weapon. It created plastics out of the organic compounds available to it, which is doable in a chlorine-heavy base atmosphere, though remarkable. And the organic plastics also handle photosynthesis. A handy trick. If we can patent it.\u201d\n On the screen the urchin rolled to a slow stop. Cruzie leaned forward. \u201cNow if we can just figure out if those bastards are really building a civilization, or just random dirt mounds . . . \u201d\n Paused at the top of a ridge, the urchin looked at a clearing in the black-leafed forest. Five pyramids thrust above the foliage around the clearing.\n \u201cCan you get closer?\u201d Beck asked, and I jumped slightly. He\u2019d been so silent, watching all this by my side.\n \u201cNot from here,\u201d Kepler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big dip in altitude between here and the clearing.\u201d\n \u201cAnd?\u201d Beck stared at the pyramids on the screen.\n \u201cOur first couple weeks here we kept driving the urchins into low lying areas, valleys, that sort of thing. They kept dying on us. We figure the chlorine and acids sink low into the valleys. Our equipment can\u2019t handle it.\u201d\n Beck sat down on the nearest couch to Kepler, and looked over the interface. \u201cTake the long way around then, I\u2019ll look at your archives while you do so. Wait!\u201d\n I saw it too. A movement through the black, spiky bushes. I saw my first alien creature scuttle around, antennae twisting as it moved along what looked like a path.\n \u201cThey look like ants,\u201d I blurted out.\n \u201cWe call them Vesians. But yes, ants the size of a small dog,\u201d Oslo said. \u201cAnd not really ants at all. Just exoskeletons, black plastic, in a similar structure. The handiwork of parallel evolution.\u201d\n More Vesians appeared carrying leaves and sticks on their backs.\n And gourds.\n \u201cNow that\u2019s interesting,\u201d Beck said.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re intelligent,\u201d Beck said later, lying in the bunk with me next to him. We both stared up at the ceiling. He rolled over and looked at me. \u201cThe gourds grow on trees. They use them to store liquids. Inside those pyramids.\u201d\n We were face to face, breathing each other\u2019s air. Beck had no personal space, and I had to fight my impulse to pull back away from him.\n My job was now to facilitate. Make Beck feel at home.\n Insect hives had drones that could exist away from the hive. A hive needed foragers, and defenders. But the human Compact only existed in the asteroid belt of the mother system.\n Beck was a long way from home.\n With the lag, he would be feeling cut off and distant. And for a mind that had always been in the embrace of the hive, this had to be hard for him.\n But Beck offered the freelance scientists a link into the massive computational capacity of the entire Compact. They\u2019d contracted it to handle the issue they couldn\u2019t figure out quickly: were the aliens intelligent or not?\n Beck was pumping information back all the way back to the mother system, so that the Compact could devote some fraction of a fraction of its massed computing ability to the issue. The minds of all its connected citizenry. Its supercomputers. Maybe even, it was rumored, artificial intelligences.\n \u201cBut if they are intelligent?\u201d I asked. \u201cHow do you prove it?\u201d\n Beck cocked his head. \u201cThe Compact is working on it. Has been ever since the individuals here signed the contract.\u201d\n \u201cThen why are you out here?\u201d\n \u201cYes . . . \u201d He was suddenly curious in me now, remembering I was a distinct individual, lying next to him. I wasn\u2019t of the Compact. I wasn\u2019t another drone.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have asked.\u201d\n \u201cIt was good you asked.\u201d He flopped over to stare at the ceiling again. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m not entirely needed. But the Compact felt it was necessary.\u201d\n I wanted to know why. But I could feel Beck hesitate. I held my breath.\n \u201cYou are a Friend. You\u2019ve never broken contract. The Compact ranks you very highly.\u201d Beck turned back to face me. \u201cWe understand that what I tell you will never leave this room, and since I debugged it, it\u2019s a safe room. What do you think it takes to become a freelance scientist in this hostile universe?\u201d\n I\u2019d been around enough negotiating tables. A good Friend, with the neural modifications and adaptive circuitry laced into me from birth, I could read body posture, micro-expressions, skin flush, heart rate, in a blink of the eye. I made a hell of a negotiating tool. Which was usually exactly what Gheda wanted: a read on their human counterparts.\n And I had learned the ins and outs of my clients businesses quick as well. I knew what the wider universe was like while doing my job.\n \u201cOslo has pent-up rage,\u201d I whispered. \u201cHis family is obsessed with the Earth as it used to be. Before the Gheda land purchases. He wants wealth, but that\u2019s not all, I think. Cruzie holds herself like she has military bearing, though she hides it. Kepler, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m guessing you will tell me they have all worked as weapons manufacturers or researchers of some sort?\u201d\n Beck nodded. \u201cOslo and his sister London are linked to a weaponized virus that was released on a Gheda station. Cruzie fought with separatists in Columbia. Kepler is a false identity. We haven\u2019t cracked her yet.\u201d\n I looked at the drone. There was no deceit in him. He stated these things as facts. He was a drone. He didn\u2019t need to question the information given to him.\n \u201cWhy are you telling me all this?\u201d\n He gestured at the bunk. \u201cYou\u2019re a professional Friend. You\u2019re safe. You\u2019re here. And I\u2019m just a drone. We\u2019re just a piece of all this.\u201d\n And then he moved to spoon against the inside of my stomach. Two meaningless, tiny lives inside a cold station, far away from where they belonged.\n \u201cAnd because,\u201d he added in a soft voice, \u201cI think that these scientists are desperate enough to fix a problem if it occurs.\u201d\n \u201cFix a problem?\u201d I asked, wrapping my arms around him.\n \u201cI think the Vesians are intelligent, and I think Kepler and Oslo plan to do something to them if, or when, it\u2019s confirmed, so that they can keep patent rights.\u201d\n I could suddenly hear every creak, whisper, and whistle in the station as I tensed up.\n \u201cI will protect you if I can. Right now we\u2019re just delaying as long as we can. Mainly I\u2019m trying to stop Cruzie from figuring out the obvious, because if she confirms they\u2019re really intelligent, then Oslo and Kepler will make their move and do something to the Vesians. We\u2019re not sure what.\u201d\n \u201cYou said delaying. Delaying until what?\u201d I asked, a slight quaver in my voice that I found I couldn\u2019t control.\n \u201cUntil the Gheda get here,\u201d Beck said with a last yawn. \u201cThat\u2019s when it all gets really complicated.\u201d His voice trailed off as he said that, and he fell asleep.\n I lay there, awake and wide-eyed.\n I finally reached up to my neck and scratched at the band of skin where the air monitor patch had once been stuck.\n Points on nothing was still just . . . nothing.\n But could I rat out my contract? My role as a Friend? Could I help Oslo and Kepler kill an alien race?\n Things had gotten very muddy in just a few minutes. I felt trapped between the hell of an old life and the hell of a horrible new one.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s a human being?\u201d I asked Beck over lunch.\n \u201cDefinitions vary,\u201d he replied.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a drone: bred to act, react, and move within a shared neural environment. You serve the Compact. There\u2019s no queen, like a classic anthill or with bees. Your shared mental overmind makes the calls. So you have a say. A tiny say. You are human . . . -ish. Our ancestors would have questioned whether you were human.\u201d\n Beck cocked his head and smiled. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n \u201cModified from birth to read human faces. Under contract for most of my life to Gheda, working to tell the aliens or other humans what humans are really thinking . . . they wouldn\u2019t have thought highly of me either.\u201d\n \u201cThe Compact knows you reread your contract last night, after I fell asleep, and you used some rather complicated algorithms to game some scenarios.\u201d\n I frowned. \u201cSo you\u2019re spying on us now.\u201d\n \u201cOf course. You\u2019re struggling with a gray moral situation.\u201d\n \u201cWhich is?\u201d\n \u201cThe nature of your contract says you need to work with me and support my needs. But you\u2019re hired by the freelancers that I\u2019m now in opposition to. As a Friend, a role and purpose burned into you just like being a drone is burned into me, do you warn them? Or do you stick by me? The contract allows for interpretations either way. And if you stick with me, it\u2019s doing so while knowing that I\u2019m just a drone. A pawn that the Compact will use as it sees fit, for its own game.\u201d\n \u201cYou left something out,\u201d I said.\n \u201cNeither you, nor I, are bred to care about Vesians,\u201d Beck said.\n I got up and walked over to the large porthole. \u201cI wonder if it wouldn\u2019t be better for them?\u201d\n \u201cWhat would?\u201d\n \u201cWhatever Kepler and Oslo want to do to them. Better to die now than to meet the Gheda. I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019d ever want to become us.\u201d\n Beck stood up. There was caution in his stance, as if he\u2019d thought I had been figured out, but now wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cI\u2019ve got work to do. Stay here and finish your meal, Friend.\u201d\n I looked down at the green world beneath, and jumped when a hand grabbed my shoulder. I could see gray words tattooed in the skin. \u201cCruzie?\u201d\n Her large brown eyes were filled with anger. \u201cThat son of a bitch has been lying to us,\u201d she said, pointing in the direction Beck had gone. \u201cCome with me.\u201d\n \u201cThe gourds,\u201d Cruzie said, pointing at a screen, and then looking at Beck. \u201cTell us about the gourds.\u201d\n And Oslo grabbed my shoulder. \u201cWatch the drone, sharp now. I want you to tell us what you see when he replies to us.\u201d\n My contract would be clear there. I couldn\u2019t lie. The scientists owned the contract, and now that they\u2019d asked directly for my services, I couldn\u2019t evade.\n Points on the package, I thought in the far back of my mind.\n I wasn\u2019t really human, was I? Not if I found the lure of eternal riches to be so great as to consider helping the freelancers.\n \u201cThe Vesians have farms,\u201d Cruzie said. \u201cBut so do ants: they grow fungus. The Vesians have roads, but so do animals in a forest. They just keep walking over the same spots. Old Earth roads used to follow old animal paths. The Vesians have buildings, but birds build nests, ants build colonies, bees build hives. But language, that\u2019s so much rarer in the animal kingdom, isn\u2019t it, Beck?\u201d\n \u201cNot really,\u201d the drone said calmly. \u201cPrimitive communication exists in animals. Including bees, which dance information. Dolphins squeak and whales sing.\u201d\n \u201cBut none of them write it down,\u201d Cruzie grinned.\n Oslo\u2019s squeezed my shoulder, hard. \u201cThe drone is mildly annoyed,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd more than a little surprised.\u201d\n Cruzie tapped on a screen. The inside of one of the pyramids appeared. It was a storehouse of some sort, filled with hundreds, maybe thousands, of the gourds I\u2019d seen earlier that the Vesian had been transporting.\n \u201cNonverbal creatures use scent. Just like ants on the mother planet. The Vesians use scents to mark territories their queens manage. And one of the things I started to wonder about, were these storage areas. What were they for? So I broke in, and I started breaking the gourds.\u201d\n Beck stiffened. \u201cHe\u2019s not happy with this line of thought,\u201d I murmured.\n \u201cThought so,\u201d Oslo said back, and nodded at Cruzie, who kept going.\n \u201cAnd whenever I broke a gourd, I found them empty. Not full of liquid, as Beck told us was likely. We originally thought they were for storage. An adaptive behavior. Or a sign of intelligence. Hard to say. Until I broke them all.\u201d\n \u201cThey could have been empty, waiting to be sealed,\u201d Beck said tonelessly.\n I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Beck. I have to do this. He\u2019s telling the truth, Oslo. But misdirecting.\u201d\n \u201cI know he is,\u201d Cruzie said. \u201cBecause the Vesians swarmed the location with fresh gourds. There were chemical scents, traces laid down in the gourds before they were sealed. The Vesians examined the broken gourds, then filled the new ones with scents. I started examining the chemical traces, and found that each gourd replaced had the same chemical sequences sprayed on and stored as the ones I broke.\u201d\n Beck\u2019s muscles tensed. Any human could see the stress now. I didn\u2019t need to say anything.\n \u201cThey were like monks, copying manuscripts. Right, Beck?\u201d Cruzie asked.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Beck said.\n \u201cAnd the chemical markers, it\u2019s a language, right?\u201d Kepler asked. I could feel the tension in her voice. It wasn\u2019t just disappointment building, but rage.\n \u201cIt is.\u201d Beck stood up slowly.\n \u201cIt took me days to realize it,\u201d Cruzie said. \u201cAnd that, after the weeks I\u2019ve been out here. The Compact spotted it right away, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n Beck looked over at me, then back at Cruzie. \u201cYes. The Compact knows.\u201d\n \u201cThen what the hell is it planning to do?\u201d Kepler moved in front of Beck, lips drawn back in a snarl.\n \u201cI\u2019m just a drone,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I can give you an answer in an hour.\u201d\n For a second, everyone stood frozen. Oslo, brimming with hurt rage, staring at Beck. Kepler, moving from anger toward some sort of decision. Cruzie looked . . . triumphant. Oblivious to the real breaking developments in the air.\n And I observed.\n Like any good Friend.\n Then a loud \u2018whooop whooop\u2019 startled us all out of our poses.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Cruzie asked, looking around.\n \u201cThe Gheda are here,\u201d Oslo, Kepler, and Beck said at the same time.\n The Path Less Traveled\n \u201cCall the vote,\u201d Oslo snapped.\n Cruzie swallowed. I saw micro beads of sweat on the side of her neck. \u201cRight now?\u201d\n \u201cGheda are inbound,\u201d Kepler said, her artificial eyes dark. I imagined she had them patched into the computers, looking at information from the station\u2019s sensors. \u201cThey\u2019ll be decelerating and matching orbit in hours. There\u2019s no time for debate, Cruzie.\u201d\n \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to do is something that requires debate. They\u2019re intelligent. We\u2019re proposing ripping that away over the next day with Kepler\u2019s tailored virus. They\u2019ll end up with a viral lobotomy, just smart enough we can claim their artifacts come from natural hive mind behavior. But we\u2019ll have stolen their culture. Their minds. Their history.\u201d Cruzie shook her head. \u201cI know we said they\u2019re going to lose most of that when the Gheda arrive. But if we do this, we\u2019re worse than Gheda.\u201d\n \u201cFucking hell, Cruzie!\u201d Oslo snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re changing your mind now?\u201d\n \u201cOslo!\u201d Cruzie held up her hands as if trying to ward off the angry words.\n \u201cYou saw our mother planet,\u201d Oslo said. \u201cThe slums. The starvation. Gheda combat patrols. They owned everyone. If you didn\u2019t provide value, you were nothing. You fought the Sahara campaign, you attacked Abbuj station. How the fuck can you turn your back to all that?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t turn my back, I wanted a different path,\u201d Cruzie said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here. With the money on the patents, we could change things . . . but what are we changing here if we\u2019re not all that better than the Gheda?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s us or the fucking ants,\u201d Kepler said, voice suddenly level. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple. Where are your allegiances?\u201d\n I bit my lip when I heard that.\n \u201cCruzie . . . \u201d I started to say.\n She held a hand up and walked over to the console, her thumb held out. \u201cIt takes a unanimous vote to unleash the virus. This was why I insisted.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Kepler said. I flinched. I could hear the hatred in her voice. She nodded at Oslo.\n He raised his walking stick. The tiny grains inside rattled around, and then a jagged finger of energy leapt out and struck Cruzie in the small of her back.\n Cruzie jerked around, arms flopping as she danced, then dropped to the ground. Oslo pressed the stick to her head and fired it again. Blood gushed from Cruzie\u2019s eye sockets as something inside her skull went \u2018pop.\u2019\n A wisp of smoke curled from her open mouth.\n Oslo and Kepler put thumbs to the screens. \u201cWe have a unanimous vote now.\u201d\n But a red warning sign flashed back at them. Beck relaxed slightly, a tiny curl of a smile briefly appearing.\n Oslo raised his walking stick and pointed it at Beck. \u201cOur communications are blocked.\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe Compact is voting against preemptive genocide.\u201d\n For a split second, I saw the decision to kill Beck flit across Kepler\u2019s face. \u201cIf you kill him,\u201d I spoke up, \u201cthe Compact will spend resources hunting you two down. You can\u2019t enjoy your riches if you\u2019re dead.\u201d\n Kepler nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d But she looked at me, a question on her face.\n I shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re all dead, I don\u2019t have points on the package.\u201d\n \u201cTrigger them manually,\u201d Oslo said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring the drone. We won\u2019t leave him up here to cause more trouble. Bring him, or her, or whatever the Friend calls itself as well. Your contract, Alex, is now to watch Beck.\u201d\n We burned our way through the green atmosphere of Ve, the lander bucking and groaning, skin cracking as it weathered the heat of our reentry fireball.\n From the tiny cramped cockpit I watched us part the clouds and spiral slowly down out of the sky as the wings unfurled from slots in the tear-drop sized vehicle\u2019s side. They started beating a complicated figure-eight motion.\n Oslo aimed his walking stick at us when the lander touched down. \u201cPut on your helmet, get out. Both of you.\u201d\n We did so.\n Heavy chlorine-rich mists swirled around, disturbed by our landing. Large puffball flowers spurted acid whenever touched by a piece of stray stirred-up debris, and the black, plastic leaves all around us bobbed gently in a low breeze.\n Oslo and Kepler pulled a large pack out of the lander\u2019s cargo area. Long pieces of tubing. They set to building a freestanding antenna, piece by piece. I watched Beck. I couldn\u2019t see his face, but I could see his posture.\n He was about to run. Which made no sense. Run where? On this world?\n Within a few minutes Oslo and Kepler had snapped together a thirty-foot tall tower. I swallowed, and remained silent. It was a choice, a deliberate path. I broke my contract.\n Oslo snapped a clip to the top of the tower, then unrolled a length of cable. He and Kepler used it to pull the super light structure up.\n That was the moment Beck ran, as it hung halfway up to standing.\n \u201cShit,\u201d Oslo cursed over the tiny speakers in our helmets, but he didn\u2019t drop the structure. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got a couple hours of air you moron!\u201d\n The only response was Beck\u2019s heavy breathing.\n When the antenna stood upright, Oslo approached me, the walking stick out. \u201cYou didn\u2019t warn us.\u201d\n \u201cHe was wearing a spacesuit,\u201d I said calmly.\n But I could see Oslo didn\u2019t believe me. His eyes creased and his fingers tightened. A bright explosion of pain ripped into me.\n My vision cleared.\n I was on my hands and feet, shaking with pain from the electrical discharge. A whirlwind of debris whipped around me. I looked up to see the lander lifting into the sky.\n So that was it. I\u2019d made my choice: to try and not be a monster.\n And it had been in vain. The Vesians would be lobotomized by Kepler\u2019s virus. Beck would die. I would die.\n I watched the lander beginning a wide spiral upward away from me. In a few seconds it would fire its rockets and climb for orbit.\n In a couple hours, I would run out of air.\n Four large gourds arced high over the black forest and slapped into the side of the lander. I frowned. At first, it looked like they had no effect. The lander kept spiraling up.\n But then, it faltered.\n The lander shook, and smoke spilled out of a crack in the side somewhere.\n It exploded, the fireball hanging in the sky.\n \u201cGet away from the antenna,\u201d Beck suddenly said. \u201cIt\u2019s next.\u201d\n I ran without a second thought, and even as I got free of the clearing, gourds of acid hit the structure. The metal sizzled, foamed, and then began to melt.\n A few seconds later, I broke out onto a dirt path where the catapults firing the gourds of acid had been towed into place.\n Beck waited for me, surrounded by a crowd of Vesians. He wore only his helmet, he\u2019d ripped his suit off. His skin bubbled from bad chemical burn blisters.\n \u201cThe Vesians destroyed all the remote-operating vehicles with the virus in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe queens have quarantined any Vesians near any area that had an ROV. The species will survive.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to them,\u201d I said. And then I thought back to the comforting smell in my room the first night Beck spent with me. \u201cYou\u2019re communicating with them. You warned them.\u201d\n Beck held up his suit. \u201cYes. The Compact altered me to be an ambassador to them.\u201d\n \u201cBeck, how long can you survive in this environment?\u201d I stared at his blistered skin.\n \u201cA year. Maybe. There will be another ready by then. Maybe a structure to live in. The Gheda will be here soon to bring air. The Compact has reached an agreement with them. The Vesian queens are agreeing to join the Compact. The Compact gets to extend out of the mother system, but only to Ve. In exchange, the Gheda get rights to all patentable discoveries made in the new ecosystem. They\u2019re particularly interested in plastic-based organic photosynthesis.\u201d\n I collapsed to the ground, realizing that I would live. Beck sat next to me. A small Vesian, approached, a gourd in its mandibles. It set the organic, plastic bottle at my legs. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n \u201cA jar of goodwill,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThe Vesian queen of this area is thanking you.\u201d\n I was still just staring at it two hours later as my air faded out, my vision blurred, and the Gheda lander finally reached us.\n The harbormaster cocked his head. \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d I said. Someone was unpacking my two bags. one of them carefully holding the Vesian \u2018gift.\u2019\n \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever see you again,\u201d the harbormaster said. \u201cNot with a contract like that.\u201d\n \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201d I looked out into the vacuum of space beyond us. \u201cCertainly not for the people who hired me. Or me.\u201d\n \u201cYou have a peripheral contract with the Compact. An all-you-can-breath line of credit on the station. You\u2019re not a citizen, but on perpetual retainer as the Compact\u2019s primary professional Friend for all dealings in this system. You did well enough.\u201d\n I grinned. \u201cPoints on a package like what they offered me was a fairy tale. A fairy tale you\u2019d have to be soulless to want to have come true.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m surprised that you did not choose to join the Compact,\u201d the harbormaster said, looking closely at me. \u201cIt is a safe place for humans in this universe. Even as a peripheral for them, you could still be in danger during patent negotiations with Gheda.\u201d\n \u201cI know. But this is home. My home. I\u2019m not a drone, I don\u2019t want to be one.\u201d\n The harbormaster sighed. \u201cYou understand the station is my only love. I don\u2019t have a social circle. There is only the ebb and flow of this structure\u2019s health for me.\u201d\n I smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s why I like you, harbormaster. You have few emotions. You are a fair dealer. You\u2019re the closest thing I have to family. You may even be the closest thing I have to a friend, friend with a lowercase \u2018f.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cYou follow your contracts to the letter. I like that about you,\u201d the harbormaster said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you will continue on here.\u201d\n Together we watched the needle-like ship that had brought me back home silently fall away from the station.\n \u201cThe Compact purchased me a ten-by-ten room with a porthole,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to come up here to sneak a look at the stars anymore.\u201d\n The harbormaster sighed happily. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful, aren\u2019t they? I think, we\u2019ve always loved them, haven\u2019t we? Even before we were forced to leave the mother world.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what the history books say,\u201d I said quietly over the sound of ducts and creaking station. \u201cWe dreamed of getting out here, to live among them. Dreamed of the wonders we\u2019d see.\u201d\n \u201cThe Gheda don\u2019t see the stars,\u201d the harbormaster said. \u201cThey have few portholes. Before I let the Gheda turn me into a harbormaster, I demanded the contract include this room.\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t see them the way we do,\u201d I agreed.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not human,\u201d the harbormaster said.\n \u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d I looked out at the distant stars. \u201cBut then, few things are anymore.\u201d\n The Gheda ship disappeared in a blinding flash of light, whipping through space toward its next destination.\n Called \"Violent, poetic and compulsively readable\" by Maclean's, science fiction author Tobias S.

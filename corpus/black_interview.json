Her first novel, Tithe, is a modern fairy tale. Her Spiderwick books tell the story of three children, a magic book, and fairies, and that series propelled her into international fame. The Curse Workers series wove urban fantasy, touch magic, and organized crime with a noir-ish tone and the dark secrets of the con.\n With her most recent book, Doll Bones, this highly imaginative and ever playful fantasist, asks what happens when we stop engaging in imaginative play.\n \u201cHolly is one of the more dynamic and interesting writers out there in terms of the variety of things she\u2019s doing,\u201d said Jeff VanderMeer, the author of the Ambergris Cycle. \u201cI love her dark sensibilities.\u201d\n Black and I talked in a hotel restaurant in Spartanburg, SC, the morning after she arrived to speak about creating magic systems at Shared Worlds, a world-building and creative writing camp I co-direct with Jeff VanderMeer.\n Fresh off a pre-pub dinner tour with booksellers and the chaotic carnival of Comic Con, Black claimed to be off her game. However, she was animated and quick to laugh as we talked about plotting novels, zombies, and the decadent joy of reading and writing vampire books.\n Back in 2009, you gave a presentation on plot here at Shared Worlds. You\u2019ve covered a lot of ground since then. Has the way you plot a novel changed much?\n Definitely, I\u2019ve been thinking about plot differently. The reason there are so many systems of plotting is that you need to hear different parts of them at different times. For a long time I would write chapter one then write chapter two then re-write chapter one then re-write chapter two then write chapter three then re-write chapter one then re-write chapter two, and I had a really hard time planning forward. Then I wrote the Curse Worker series of novels which have cons at their center, which meant I had to plan the books in greater detail. The cons had to stay the way they were and they gave a spine to each book. I thought, \u201cThis is great! I\u2019ve figured out plotting!\u201d Then I sat down to write Coldtown and it doesn\u2019t have a con at the center of it and I was back to sort of feeling my way in the dark.\n I understand the three arc\u2014or sometimes four arc\u2014structure that people talk about. At least I think I understand it. But it\u2019s not always the thing that will help me puzzle through the thing I am puzzling through.\n Is that part of the thrill of potting\u2014that puzzling, that feeling your way in the dark?\n I would not say so! [Laughter.] I would say just the opposite. It\u2019s the thing that\u2019s the most painful. I feel like writing a book is a magic trick. Each time I am fairly sure one day I will not pull off. The book I am working now is called The Darkest Part of the Forest. It\u2019s a Faerie book. And I was really having a rough, rough time with it. On the plane ride out to do the pre-pub tour, I finally got the idea that made me understand what the book was, but until then I thought, this is one. This is the one where I\u2019m going to have to call up my editor and be like, \u201cCan I write you a different book, because I don\u2019t know how to write this book? I thought I did, but now I don\u2019t.\u201d [Laughter.]\n Until that draft is turned in, I often feel a great deal of anxiety and dread that I will be unable to pull it off. I think that\u2019s why I like re-writing so much.\n Because you have something in front of you?\n At that point, it\u2019s cleaning it up. It\u2019s making it better. It\u2019s enhancing it. I know what it is then.\n How do you balance the need for time to figure out the puzzle and an increasing number of shorter and shorter deadlines?\n I do a lot of talking about stuff with writer friends. Like, \u201cI\u2019m stuck on this thing. What am I missing?\u201d That can be really helpful because you use a different part of your brain to talk about story than you do to write. I think that when you\u2019re talking about your book you can get a greater sense of the whole book at once, whereas when you\u2019re down in it you\u2019re often looking at it through the protagonist\u2019s eyes and you can only look a little bit ahead. Or, at least, I have difficulty seeing more than a little bit ahead, so talking about it is really helpful. Sometimes you just know that there\u2019s something wrong and you don\u2019t know how to make it right until . . . until you do. That\u2019s the part that I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any other way through.\n Also, I suppose when you\u2019re talking with someone you can gauge by their response, their facial expressions.\n And they can call you out. They can be like, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. What do you mean? How do they get from here to there?\u201d Stephen King, in On Writing, talks about plot as being something that you have to discover like you\u2019re in an archaeological dig. If you take a jackhammer to it, you\u2019ll destroy it. I remember reading that when I was working with friends to try to figure out how to make a plot. We\u2019d sit down and they try to help me figure out the plot and I thought, \u201cThat can\u2019t be true! We\u2019re getting a plot and this is great.\u201d\n But more and more I\u2019ve come to understand what King was saying and I don\u2019t think it was what I originally took it to mean. But, rather, that you can create a plot but you still have to find your way to the story that it is. When your perfectly laid plan falls apart, it is only for a good reason and it\u2019s because you need to find the story still.\n Has the plot of any of your books changed drastically from talking with friends?\n Absolutely! You hear yourself and you\u2019re like, \u201cOh! That\u2019s what it is!\u201d Stuff floats in your head and you don\u2019t realized quite what it means until you\u2019re really talking about it. A lot of times I have floaty ideas about what happens, and it helps to actually say, \u201cThis then this then this then this . . . Or the consequences of that is this . . . Or what I really mean by that is this . . . \u201d Taking it from the general to the specific is really, really helpful and, a lot of times, it really pushes your forward.\n Speaking of pushing forward, where does a book usually start for you?\n They usually start with an image or a little bit of a premise and a mood\u2014very much a mood. I want to feel this. I want the reader to feel this. With Doll Bones, I knew that the doll was going to be made out of bone China that was made out of human bones. I knew that, and I knew that it was going to be a story about what it mean to stop playing, to stop telling stories together.\n How do you\u2014\n [Laughter.] I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\n As your career grows, it seems like it\u2019d be harder for you to take risks, but here are you are taking greater risks.\n Doll Bones is a story I wanted to tell for a long time. When I was first talking about it with people at my publisher, everybody had a story about how they stopped, when they stopped, why they stopped playing, and a lot of times it wasn\u2019t that they wanted to stop. Someone mocked them for playing a game they\u2019d always played. Something went wrong and there was some reason why they stopped.\n The obvious way to tell Doll Bones was from the girl who is visited by the ghost and who sends him on the quest and who doesn\u2019t want to give up playing with dolls. Her name is Poppy. Originally, I thought this was Poppy\u2019s story. And I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve written it until I realized, no, it\u2019s Zach\u2019s story, because you are asking the same questions Zach is asking.\n Do you know whose story it is before pen hits paper?\n Ideally, you know but that\u2019s not always how it happens. In the case of Doll Bones I\u2019d only written a very little bit before I realized it.\n In reading the \u201cHow I wrote . . . \u201d posts on your blog, it seems like you throw out a lot of what you write.\n I threw out the first three chapters of Coldtown and then I threw out thirty thousand words in the middle. It was really painful.\n Why?\n \u201cThe Coldest Girl in Coldtown\u201d was originally a short story. And I had some idea that what I was going to do in the novel was take the characters from the short story plus new characters and take them on an adventure. Great! I had a different idea for a different beginning where a girl woke up after a party where everyone was dead. But I thought I probably shouldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s probably a noir-ish leftover from my Curse Worker days. I wrote three chapters with a different beginning, and then I realized, no, that the other beginning is the beginning and when I started writing it I really, really liked it.\n You feel it in your body. It\u2019s like you have a limb that is out of place and you get it snapped back in. You can just tell when it\u2019s the right thing.\n Do you labor over cutting 30,000 words? Try to save them?\n What happened is the kids in Coldtown are on a sort of road trip to Coldtown, which is a desperate move. Once you go inside the gates you can\u2019t go unless you have this particular kind of marker which means you bounty hunted a vampire. It\u2019s pretty scary. It\u2019s been built up throughout most of the book and I was so excited to be in Coldtown that I wrote a lot of things in Coldtown, had a lot of fun in Coldtown at first, and that was just wrong. You don\u2019t have fun in the vampire city. It\u2019s terrifying! [Laughter] Well, maybe you can have a little fun. But not then. Not when you just go in. So I had all this really fun stuff that I had to take out because it wasn\u2019t pacing right.\n I had so much I wanted to show the characters! From a pacing point of view it was meant to be a misdirect. Look, I\u2019m going to lull you. But it didn\u2019t work that way. You guys can\u2019t not hang out in Coldtown! It didn\u2019t feel right. My friends were supportive but slightly horrified when I cut it. There were like, \u201cDo you really need to? It was fine! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t!\u201d But they\u2019re used to it by now.\n It was complicated. I had to take two kids out of the group. I had to change the dynamic of who met who when.\n To take out the middle do you have to go back to the beginning?\n Sometimes you do. I\u2019ve re-thought the book I am writing now, and I\u2019m back in the beginning, retyping every word, because there\u2019re too many changes. Re-typing the whole thing, then I have to write the rest. I really envy people who have a better process! [Laughter.] Someday I\u2019m going to have a better process. That\u2019s my goal. That\u2019s why I love reading these books about how write a book in like thirty days. I just feel someday someone is going to say the thing that\u2019s going to fix my process.\n What has been your most efficient book?\n I think Red Glove. That book was fast. I wrote the beginning of it in Mexico on a writing retreat. I\u2019d come right off the last Spiderwick tour and I knew the characters from writing White Cat. It was a direct sequel and I had thought a lot about the beginning. I was really excited to work on it. It went the most smoothly of any book I\u2019ve ever written. Pretty fast. Pretty painless. Not entirely painless. Coldtown, for all I had to gut it twice, it was a lot of fun to write.\n What was fun about Coldtown?\n I took every single thing about vampires that I liked in my misspent youth and jammed them into this book. It\u2019s full of decadence and buckets of blood. All the things I like.\n Vampires have gone through a lot of changes since you and I were teenagers.\n Whenever you write a book, you are in dialogue with what came before it and certainly there\u2019s no way to write a vampire book now and not have people think of Twilight. It\u2019s just not possible, because Twilight has loomed so large in the public consciousness.\n You know, I thought, \u201cReally? Am I really going to do this? Am I really going to write a vampire book now?\u201d Part way through, I turned to my friends and said, \u201cWho let me do this?\u201d In all the time I\u2019ve been around, vampires have only ever been \u201cso over\u201d that someone would be crazy to write one or so popular that someone would be crazy to write one. I figured that there\u2019s no time that they\u2019re not going to fall into one of those two categories so I might just as well write it now.\n But I had to ask myself, \u201cDo I have anything to bring to the genre? Do I have anything to add?\u201d In Coldtown, there are these quarantined areas, but people are able to broadcast out of them with live feeds. They\u2019re able to update their Tumbler pages from the inside.\n When I was writing Coldtown, I was thinking a lot about reality television. I watch some truly crappy reality television, by the way, so I\u2019m not writing a book judging reality television. But I was interested in the way that real reality is inevitable in reality television. A few years ago on VH-1 there was a show called \u201cMegan Wants a Millionaire,\u201d which was an off-shoot of Brett Michael\u2019s \u201cRock of Love,\u201d you may recall which in itself was an off-shoot of Flavor Flav\u2019s show. They had to pull the plug on \u201cMegan Wants a Millionaire\u201d because one of the contestants had allegedly killed his girlfriend. I say \u201callegedly\u201d because he never went to trial. He killed himself. They cancelled the show halfway through the season. Like, \u201cLet\u2019s pretend this show never happened.\u201d Several years later on \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d one of the husbands killed himself. Who knows why anyone does anything, but . . . Some of his sketchy financial dealings had come to light. And they didn\u2019t cancel the show. They broadcast it. They re-cut it to pull that into the storyline. At the re-union show, someone said, \u201cWell, maybe we shouldn\u2019t have shown this?\u201d And I thought, \u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d But I watched all of it and didn\u2019t feel culpable.\n So, what would it be like if you could watch kids in this quarantined area, going to vampire parties, wanting to become vampires, killing and dying? How far away would it seem like it was happening?\n How do your long-time readers feel about a vampire novel from you?\n I think that they\u2019re \u201cin.\u201d I was asked by fans if I\u2019d ever write a vampire novel. People like vampires.\n Why, though?\n Why? [Laughter.] Vampires are an endlessly flexible metaphor. We go through a cycle with vampires. We have vampire as as villain force that we fight, then we have vampire as anti-hero, then we have vampire as romantic obsession, then we have vampire as hero. And we cycle right back around.\n Yeah, but\u2014\n Everybody\u2019s got their thing. For years, I\u2019ve been having people telling me they don\u2019t like fairy books. So now I go and write a vampire book.\n When I was a kid, the first vampire book I read may have been Interview with a Vampire [by Anne Rice], which I bought for 25 cents at a garage and it had this old cover of the characters on the back with their faces painted white. They looked ridiculous\u2014a really amazing cover. I read that book over and over again. I loved it so much. Then I read Les Daniels who had that series about a vampire who traveled through time, I believe, by going back into his silver skull. He was some kind of alchemist or magician in addition to being a vampire. Each time he traveled he romanced a different lady. One was [set in] the Dark Ages; one was set during the French Revolution, called Citizen Vampire, and then one was Aztec. Then I read Tanith Lee\u2019s Sabella, or the Blood Star, which is one of my favorite books ever.\n What was it about vampire books that appealed to the teenage and twenty-something you?\n Certainly, being in the monster\u2019s head the way you were with Interview felt real fresh at the time; it felt very shocking. The book was scary but I wasn\u2019t scared. And . . . it was very decadent! It\u2019s this fabulously decadent, debauched story\u2014that\u2019s what appealed to me! [Laughter.] Descriptions of wine and blood co-mingling, you know? I was into it. I was all for it.\n The thing about vampires is that they create an idealized version of us and they create a debased version of us in one being. They\u2019re us, staying as young as we are. We\u2019ll never get older. We\u2019ll never get less beautiful. We\u2019ll probably be able to manage our money situation because, let\u2019s face it, we can invest now. Vampires are the aristocrats if the undead, but they are also us in our most uncontrolled, debased state.\n Jeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

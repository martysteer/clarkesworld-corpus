So are stories. They intertwine. So when a story tackles time, and you invest your time in tackling that story . . . things get very interesting.\n Red and Blue slip along time threads. They\u2019re on different sides of a war unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen. They leave notes for one another, chiding and taunting each other over each bumble or successful mission. Cleverly told with each of their signature sensibilities on display, El-Mohtar and Gladstone weave a tale that hurdles through both space and time.\n Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone are the award-winning authors of dozens of short stories and novels. Their fiction has appeared everywhere from Clarkesworld Magazine to Tor.com, Fireside Fiction, Lightspeed, Uncanny, Strange Horizons, Apex, and more. Their new book written together is This Is How You Lose the Time War, which will be available July 16th from Tor Books.\n How did you two meet?\n Amal: We met at Readercon in 2014. I used to be on the programming committee, and was attending one of the panels for which I\u2019d written up a description. Max was on that panel, being characteristically brilliant, saying all the things that I\u2019d hoped someone would while designing it\u2014to the extent that I found myself frustrated that I wasn\u2019t just having the conversation with him myself! Later that evening we met properly at a party, and I remember saying something like \u201cHey, I think if we sat down and talked for a while we could solve some of the world\u2019s problems.\u201d And then within a year I was inviting him and his wife to my wedding, and within two years we were writing a novella together! Still working on those world problems, though.\n Max: Ad astra per et cetera!\n What made you want to write a book together?\n Max: Have you met Amal? I mean, really! From the earliest stages of our friendship we were always bouncing ideas off each other, sharing our own lives and points of view, and so often we\u2019d find ourselves approaching the same idea from different directions\u2014and getting excited by the pattern of each other\u2019s thought, our different angles on the world. And our writing felt complementary too\u2014different angles of approach, but all captured by the same black hole, all drawn down toward the same unseen destination. We knew we had to work on something together, and a novella seemed like the ideal form: small and focused enough to test us, but expansive enough to contain a multiverse with the right technique.\n What did your process for crafting this novel look like? Did each of you tackle one side of the time war?\n Amal: Ironically\u2014given the epistolary nature of the project\u2014we wrote the whole thing while in each other\u2019s company, over the course of a writing retreat, time stolen from a convention, and a visit I made to Boston. We knew we were coming into this project with very different styles and aptitudes, and chose letter writing to make a virtue of those differences. So we divided by character: One of us would write the letter, and the other would write the situation in which the letter was received. Then we\u2019d swap laptops, read what we\u2019d written, exclaim in delight, and move on to the next part.\n Max: Dividing the war like that made the writing process mimic the movement of our characters in a way that felt electric. As Red and Blue orbited one another in tighter and tighter circles, so did our writing.\n Did you ever play games or challenge each other to who could finish their sections first?\n Amal: Not exactly! Max writes roughly four times as fast as I do, and descriptions of space and action and movement come much more naturally to him than to me. So the first few exchanges involved him finishing his section and waiting (with genuine kind patience because he is the literal best human) for me to finish my painstaking canoodling through poetry and sensory affect.\n But as we went on, as we read each other\u2019s sections and got more excited and delighted by each other\u2019s work, we started learning from each other, and he slowed down while I sped up, so that by Act Two we were finishing at almost exactly the same time, so that swapping laptops and reading the work felt like this beautiful choreographed dance as we generated a positive feedback loop of encouragement and cheer.\n Max: In that way the whole process was a game!\n Did you edit each other\u2019s sections?\n Amal: Very little; we\u2019d catch typos and continuity errors in each other\u2019s sections, but mostly do the editing ourselves within what we\u2019d written.\n Max: Every once in a while we\u2019d drop a margin comment about continuity, but for the most part the \u201cediting\u201d took place in the form of long conversations about what needed to happen next, how we\u2019d have to revise our earlier work. Then we\u2019d break, work separately, and crow about our success.\n How did you deal with the paradoxes inherently associated with time travel stories?\n Amal: Part of that is spoilers, but most of it is many-worlds interpretation and quantum decoherence and just generally backgrounding mechanics in order to foreground character and feeling. We also lean into the resonance of how letters are their own kind of time travel, in which you\u2019re less concerned with moving forward or backward so long as you\u2019re moving towards each other.\n If you could slip along the time thread to any period, what would it be and why?\n Amal: So many variables here\u2014can I move in space? Is it a one-way trip? How long can I stay? Do I only get one shot? Am I universally translated? Am I always appearing as myself or do I get something like the Doctor\u2019s Psychic Paper to help me along? Can I affect proceedings?\n I think I\u2019ve often felt the desire to look backwards to a place or time that was Good, that was better in some way than our present moment, or that Could Have Been Good If. I\u2019m wary of that desire now. Sure I\u2019d love to have listened to Enheduanna recite her praise-verse to Inanna in Ur, or read any of the millions of books that have been lost or destroyed over millennia, or talk to Coleridge about The Arabian Nights, or go on a very long walk with Naomi Mitchison\u2014but I think the end of this kind of exercise is to realize what you care deeply about now, what you don\u2019t want to miss out on, what you want for the future. And I guess really what I want is to slip along the time thread to a place with a stable climate and the liberation of all sentient beings\u2014even if it\u2019s moving into the future a day at a time.\n What made you choose to have these characters on each side of the war interact in almost a playful manner by leaving hidden notes for each other?\n Max: We started writing letters to each other early in our friendship\u2014for many reasons, really. A letter is an utterly unique gift. It\u2019s untracked, unarchived, unsearched. There is no public, performative component of a letter\u2014as there is in so much of our lives these days, especially if you\u2019re in on social media in any active professional sense. Letter writing felt like something small and real snatched away from an increasingly mad world. I could fall into a letter knowing Amal would be there to catch me, and vice versa. And, as Amal has mentioned, letters have their own sort of time travel\u2014they\u2019re bits of time and soul spread across the writing of them, sent forward to a correspondent who may be in desperate need of just that time, just that soul. There\u2019s something of the secret agent to any writer of letters. In a way, the whole book came from that seed.\n Besides each other, what other writer, living or dead would you like to collaborate with?\n Amal: Bracketing all the amazing people with whom I\u2019ve already collaborated (C.S.E. Cooney, Nicole Kornher-Stace, Caitlyn Paxson, Cat Valente, Jessica P. Wick) or discussed collaborating (Fran Wilde, Arkady Martine)\u2014Lin-Manuel Miranda. I mean, why not. And Rebecca Sugar while I\u2019m at it. Actually, like, the three of us, maybe, in a room together, making things happen. And George Eliot.\n Max: Can I join?\n Amal: In my head we\u2019re already breaking narrative ground on the Queer Middlemarch Meets Moana in Space project of our dreams!\n Did the story grow out of the telling or did you both figure out the structure and plot before fleshing it out chapter by chapter?\n Amal: We had a rough act-based breakdown of story beats, and would discuss the situation in which the letter was to be received, but not the contents of the letters themselves, which were always a surprise, even when we were aware of what forward plot-motion they were supposed to accomplish. I remember there was one climactic point where we kept going back and forth trying to figure out how to denoue the ment of it all, and we paced across that tiny gazebo until we both lay down on the floor and stared at the ceiling for a while, full of the what but incapable of articulating the how.\n We got there eventually, though!\n What is one piece of writing advice that has stuck with you?\n Amal: I first encountered this anonymously on Tumblr, but some googling suggests it\u2019s attributed to Jane Smiley: \u201cEvery first draft is perfect, because all a first draft has to do is exist.\u201d I am fantastic at giving this advice and absolutely dreadful at internalizing it.\n Max: No one gave me this advice, but for years now I\u2019ve had on my desktop a Post-it note saying in all caps: YOU DO NOT NEED PERMISSION. Obviously not comprehensive life advice! I mean, permission is important for any activity that involves more than one person! But when creating in solitude or in a tight pair, it\u2019s important to remember that, yes, you can write this sentence, make this comparison, turn the scene in just this way. These characters can go that far over the line. You can make this work about something you love, rather than something you think other people want to read. The worst you\u2019ll get is a scene that does not work, a character that falls flat. (That\u2019s part of the relief of working with someone, too\u2014you can see instantly what works for them and what doesn\u2019t.) What exists that doesn\u2019t work can always be fixed. What doesn\u2019t exist, can\u2019t.\n What is one piece of writing advice that you gave each other?\n Amal: \u201cHey Max, maybe you should eat something.\u201d\n Max: \u201cJust keep going! It\u2019s amazing already, and if anything needs fixing we\u2019ll fix it in post!\u201d\n What projects are you working on next?\n Amal: We\u2019re working on scripting the pilot episode for a This Is How You Lose the Time War TV show! It\u2019s very early days yet but the process has been so exciting to me\u2014Max has a lot more experience with scripts and serialized fictions more generally, and it\u2019s been wonderful to get to learn this form alongside him. Speaking more singly\u2014and with the weary awareness of how often I\u2019ve said this in interviews over the last mumblety years\u2014I\u2019m finishing a doctoral dissertation and determining when exactly, between writing criticism and short fiction and teaching and traveling, I can knuckle down to a novel.\n Max: So much! This summer sees the release of This Is How You Lose The Time War and Empress of Forever. My main projects after that are still in motion but include the climactic conclusion of the Craft Sequence, another book I can\u2019t talk about much just yet, the Time War TV series of course, another video project I can\u2019t talk about yet, and, after all that, blue skies and the open sea.\n Chris Urie is a writer and editor from Ocean City, NJ.

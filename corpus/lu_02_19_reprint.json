You gather your things and exit back into the brightly lit hallway. Photos line the walls: the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu. The sun shines on each destination, the images brimming with wonder. You pause before the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\u201c\u53f3\u62d0\u5c31\u5230\u4e86,\u201d the attendant says. You look up. His blond hair is as standardized as his Mandarin, as impeccable as his crisp shirt and tie. You\u2019ve just proven your aptitude in English, but hearing Mandarin still puts you at ease in the way only a mother tongue does. You smile at the attendant, murmuring a brief thanks as you make your way down the hall.\nYou turn right and enter a consultation room. The room is small but welcoming, potted plants adding a dash of green to the otherwise plain creams and browns of the furniture and walls. A literature rack stands to one side, brochures in all kinds of languages tucked into its pockets, creating a mosaic of sights and symbols. The section just on English boasts multiple flags, names of different varieties overlaid on the designs: US English\u2014Standard. UK English\u2014Received Pronunciation. Singaporean English\u2014Standard. Nigerian English\u2014Standard . . . Emblazoned on every brochure is the logo of the Linguistic Grading Society of America, a round seal with a side view of a head showing the vocal tract.\nYou pick up a Standard US English brochure and take a seat in one of the middle chairs opposite the mahogany desk that sits before the window. The brochure provides a brief overview of the grading system; your eyes linger on the A-grade description: Speaker engages on a wide variety of topics with ease. (Phonology?) is standard; speaker has a broad vocabulary . . . You take a quick peek at the dictionary on your phone. Phonology-linguistic sound systems. You file the word away to remember later.\nThe door opens. A woman wearing a blazer and pencil skirt walks in, her heels clacking against the hardwood floor, her curled hair bouncing with every step. You stand to greet her and catch a breath of her perfume.\n\u201cDiana Moss,\u201d she says, shaking your hand. Her name tag also displays her job title: Language Broker.\n\u201cJiawen Liu,\u201d you reply. Diana takes a seat across from you; as you sit, you smooth out your skirt, straighten your sleeves.\n\u201cIs English all right?\u201d Diana asks. \u201cI can get an interpreter in if you\u2019d prefer to discuss in Mandarin.\u201d\n\u201cEnglish is fine,\u201d you reply. You clasp your hands together as you eye Diana\u2019s tablet. She swipes across the screen and taps a few spots, her crimson nails stark against the black barrel of the stylus.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, let\u2019s dive right in, shall we? I\u2019m showing that you\u2019ve been in the US for, let\u2019s see, fifteen years now? Wow, that\u2019s quite a while.\u201d\nYou nod. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you used to be an economics professor in China, is that correct?\u201d\nYou nod again. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d Diana says. \u201cJust one moment as I load the results; the scores for the oral portion always take a moment to come in . . . \u201d\nYour palms are clammy, sweaty; Diana twirls the stylus and you can\u2019t help feeling a little dizzy as you watch. Finally, Diana props the tablet up and turns it toward you.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to inform you that your English has tested at a C-grade,\u201d she says with a broad smile.\nYour heart sinks. Surely there\u2019s been some kind of error, but no, the letter is unmistakable: bright red on the screen, framed with flourishes and underlined with signatures; no doubt the certificate is authentic. Diana\u2019s perfume is too heady now, sickly sweet; the room is too bright, suffocating as the walls shrink in around you.\n\u201cI . . . \u201d you say, then take a breath. \u201cI was expecting better.\u201d\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, your scores on the written and analytical portions of the test were excellent, better than many native speakers of English in the US,\u201d Diana says.\n\u201cThen what brought my score down?\u201d\n\u201cOur clients are looking for a certain . . . profile of English,\u201d Diana says, apologetic. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested in retesting, I can refer you to an accent reduction course\u2014I\u2019ve seen many prospective sellers go through the classes and get recertified at a higher grade.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t mention how much the accent reduction course costs, but from your own research, you know it\u2019s more than you can afford.\n\u201cMs. Liu?\u201d Diana says. She\u2019s holding out a tissue; you accept it and dab at your eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re trying to accomplish? Maybe we can assist you.\u201d\nYou take in a deep breath as you crumple the tissue into your fist. \u201cMy daughter Lillian just got into Stanford, early decision,\u201d you say.\n\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but we can\u2019t afford it.\u201d C-grade English sells at only a fraction of A-grade English; you\u2019d rather keep your English than sell it for such a paltry sum that would barely put a dent in textbooks and supplies, never mind tuition and housing.\n\u201cThere are other tracks you can consider,\u201d Diana says, her voice gentle. \u201cYour daughter can go to a community college, for instance, and then transfer out to Stanford again\u2014\u201d\nYou shake your head.\n\u201cCommunity colleges in the San Gabriel Valley are among the top in the nation,\u201d Diana continues. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in it.\u201d\nYou\u2019re unconvinced. What if she can\u2019t transfer out? You and Lillian can\u2019t risk that; a good education at a prestigious school is far too important for securing Lillian\u2019s future. No, better to take this opportunity that\u2019s already been given to her and go with it.\nDiana stands and goes over to the literature rack. She flips through a few brochures.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Diana says as she strides back to you, \u201cChina\u2019s really hot right now\u2014with their new open-door policy, lots of people are (clamoring?) to invest there; I have people calling me all the time, asking if I have A-grade Mandarin.\u201d\nShe sets a brochure down on the desk and sits back in the executive chair across from you.\n\u201cHave you considered selling your Mandarin?\u201d\nYou trace your hands over the brochure, feeling the embossed logo. China\u2019s flag cascades down to a silhouette of Beijing\u2019s skyline; you read the Simplified characters printed on the brochure, your eyes skimming over them so much more quickly than you skim over English.\n\u201cHow much?\u201d you ask.\nDiana leans in. \u201cA-grade Mandarin is going for as much as $800,000 these days.\u201d\nYour heart skips a beat. That would be enough to cover Lillian\u2019s college, with maybe a little bit left over\u2014it\u2019s a tantalizing number. But the thought of going without Mandarin gives you pause: it\u2019s the language you think in, the language that\u2019s close to your heart in the way English is not; it\u2019s more integral to who you are than any foreign tongue. English you could go without\u2014Lillian\u2019s Mandarin is good enough to help you translate your way around what you need\u2014but Mandarin?\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . I\u2019m not sure,\u201d you say, setting down the brochure. \u201cSelling my Mandarin . . . \u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big decision, for sure,\u201d Diana says. She pulls a small, silver case out from the pocket of her blazer and opens it with a click. \u201cBut, if you change your mind . . . \u201d\nShe slides a sleek business card across the table.\n\u201c . . . call me.\u201d\nYou decide to go for a week without Mandarin, just to see if you can do it. At times, the transition feels seamless: so many of the people in the San Gabriel Valley are bilingual; you get by fine with only English. Your job as a librarian in the local public library is a little trickier, though; most of your patrons speak English, but a few do not.\nYou decide to shake your head and send the Mandarin-only speakers over to your coworker, who also speaks Mandarin. But when lunchtime comes around, she sits beside you in the break room and gives you a curious look.\n\u201c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4eca\u5929\u628a\u987e\u5ba2\u8f6c\u7ed9\u6211?\u201d she asks.\nYou figure that you might as well tell her the truth: \u201cI want to sell my Mandarin. I\u2019m seeing what it would be like without it.\u201d\n\u201c\u5356\u4f60\u7684\u666e\u901a\u8bdd?\u201d she responds, an incredulous look on her face. \u201c\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5!\u201d\nYou resent being called crazy, even if some part of you wonders if this is a foolish decision. Still, you soldier on for the rest of the week in English. Your coworker isn\u2019t always there to cover for you when there are Mandarin-speaking patrons, and sometimes you break your vow and say a few quick sentences in Mandarin to them. But the rest of the time, you\u2019re strict with yourself.\nConversation between you and Lillian flows smoothly, for the most part. Normally, you speak in a combination of English and Mandarin with her, and she responds mostly in English; when you switch to English-only, Lillian doesn\u2019t seem to notice. On the occasions when she does speak to you in Mandarin, you hold back and respond in English too, your roles reversed.\nAt ATMs, you choose English instead of Chinese. When you run errands, \u201cthank you\u201d replaces \u201c\u8c22\u8c22.\u201d It\u2019s only until Friday rolls around and you\u2019re grocery shopping with your mother that not speaking in Mandarin becomes an issue.\nYou\u2019re in the supermarket doing your best to ignore the Chinese characters labeling the produce: so many things that you don\u2019t know the word for in English. But you recognize them by sight, and that\u2019s good enough; all you need is to be able to pick out what you need. If you look at things out of the corner of your eye, squint a little bit, you can pretend to be illiterate in Chinese, pretend to navigate things only by memory instead of language.\nYou can cheat with your mother a little bit: you know enough Cantonese to have a halting conversation with her, as she knows both Cantonese and Mandarin. But it\u2019s frustrating, your pauses between words lengthy as you try to remember words and tones.\n\u201c\u5e72\u5417\u4eca\u5929\u8bf4\u5e7f\u4e1c\u8bdd?\u201d your mother asks in Mandarin. She\u2019s pushing the shopping cart\u2014she insists, even when you offer\u2014and one of the wheels is squeaking. She hunches over the handle, but her eyes are bright.\n\u201cNgo jiu syut Gwongdungwaa,\u201d you reply in Cantonese. Except it\u2019s not exactly that you want to speak Cantonese; you have to, for now. You don\u2019t know how to capture the nuance of everything you\u2019re going through in Cantonese, either, so you leave it at that. Your mother gives you a look, but she doesn\u2019t bring it up again and indulges you, speaking Cantonese as the two of you go around the supermarket and pile the shopping cart high with produce, meat, and fish.\nYou load the car with the groceries and help your mother into the passenger seat. As you adjust the mirrors, your mother speaks again.\n\u201c\u4f60\u5728\u62c5\u5fc3\u4ec0\u4e48?\u201d she asks. Startled, you look over at her. She\u2019s peering at you, scrutinizing you; you can never hide anything from her. Of course she can read the worry on your face, the tension in your posture; of course she knows something\u2019s wrong.\n\u201cNgo jau zou yat go han zungjiu dik kyutding,\u201d you respond, trying to communicate the weight on your shoulders.\n\u201c\u4ec0\u4e48\u51b3\u5b9a?\u201d Ma replies.\nYou can\u2019t find the words to express the choice you have to make in Cantonese. Every time you grasp for the right syllables, they come back in Mandarin; frustrated, you switch back to Mandarin and reply,\n\u201c\u6211\u8981\u7528\u6211\u7684\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u6765\u8d5a\u94b1\u53bb\u9001Lillian\u4e0a\u5927\u5b66\u3002\u201d\nYou expect your mother to scold you, to tell you about the importance of your heritage and language\u2014she\u2019s always been proud of who she is, where she\u2019s from; she\u2019s always been the first to teach you about your own culture\u2014but instead her expression softens, and she puts a hand over yours, her wrinkled skin warm against your skin.\n\u201c\u54ce\uff0c\u5609\u5609\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\u529e\u6cd5\u5417?\u201d\nYour nickname is so tender on her tongue. But you\u2019ve thought through all other avenues: you don\u2019t want Lillian to take out loans and be saddled with so much debt like your friends\u2019 children; you don\u2019t want her to bear such a burden her entire life, not while you\u2019re still paying off debts too. You can\u2019t rely on Lillian\u2019s father to provide for her, not after he left your family and took what little money you had. And although Lillian\u2019s been doing her best to apply for scholarships, they\u2019re not enough.\nYou shake your head.\nThe two of you sit in silence as you start the car and drive back to your mother\u2019s place. The sun sets behind you, casting a brilliant glow over the Earth, washing the sky from orange to blue. As you crest over a hill, the sparkling lights of the city below glitter in the darkness, showing you a million lives, a million dreams.\nWhen you get to your mother\u2019s house, you only have one question to ask her.\n\u201c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u505a\u540c\u6837\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a,\u201d you say, \u201c\u4f60\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u5417?\u201d\nYou don\u2019t know what it would have been like if you were in Lillian\u2019s shoes, if your mother had to make the same decision as you. But as your mother smiles at you, sadness tinging the light in her eyes, the curve of her lips, you know she understands.\n\u201c\u5f53\u7136,\u201d she says.\nOf course.\nThe waiting room is much starker than the consultation room you were in before: the seats are less comfortable, the temperature colder; you\u2019re alone except for a single TV playing world news at a low volume.\nYou read the paperwork, doing your best to understand the details of the procedure\u2014for all you pride yourself on your English, though, there are still many terms you don\u2019t understand completely:\nThe Company\u2019s (proprietary?) algorithms (iterate?) through near-infinite (permutations?) of sentences, extracting a neural map. The (cognitive?) load on the brain will cause the Applicant to experience a controlled stroke, and the Applicant\u2019s memory of the Language will be erased. Common side effects include: temporary disorientation, nausea. Less common side effects include partial (aphasia?) of nontarget languages and (retrograde?) amnesia. Applicant agrees to hold Company harmless . . .\nYou flip over to the Chinese version of the contract, and, while some of the terms raise concern in you, you\u2019ve already made your decision and can\u2019t back out now. You scan the rest of the agreement and sign your name at the bottom.\nThe lab is clinical, streamlined, with a large, complicated-looking machine taking up most of the room. An image of the brain appears on a black panel before you.\n\u201cBefore we begin,\u201d the technician says, \u201cdo you have any questions?\u201d\nYou nod as you toy with your hospital gown. \u201cWill I be able to learn Mandarin again?\u201d\n\u201cPotentially, though it won\u2019t be as natural or easy as the first time around. Learning languages is usually harder than losing them.\u201d\nYou swallow your nervousness. Do it for Lillian. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you make a copy of the language instead of erasing it?\u201d\nThe technician smiles ruefully. \u201cAs our current technology stands, the imaging process has the unfortunate side effect of suppressing neurons as it replicates them . . . \u201d\nYou can\u2019t help but wonder cynically if the reason why the neurons have to be suppressed is to create artificial scarcity, to inflate demand in the face of limited supply. But if that scarcity is what allows you to put Lillian through college, you\u2019ll accept it.\nThe technician hooks electrodes all over your head; there\u2019s a faint hum, setting your teeth on edge.\nAs the technician finishes placing the last of the electrodes on your head, certain parts of the brain on the panel light up, ebbing and flowing, a small chunk in the back active; you try to recall the areas of the brain from biology classes in university, and, while different parts of your brain start to light up, you still don\u2019t remember the names of any of the regions.\nThe technician flips a couple switches, then types a few commands. The sensation that crawls over you is less of a shock than a tingling across your scalp. Thoughts flash through your mind too fast for you to catch them; you glance up at the monitor and see light firing between the areas the technician pointed out, paths carving through the brain and flowing back and forth. The lights flash faster and faster until they become a single blur, and as you watch, your world goes white.\nThe technician and nurse keep you at the institute for a few hours to monitor your side effects: slight disorientation, but that fades as the time goes by. They ask if you have anyone picking you up; you insist that you\u2019re fine taking public transportation by yourself, and the technician and nurse relent. The accountant pays you the first installment of the money, and soon you\u2019re taking the steps down from the institute\u2019s main doors, a cool breeze whipping at your hair.\nThe bus ride home is . . . strange. As you go from west Los Angeles toward the San Gabriel Valley, the English-dominating billboards and signs starts to give way to Chinese. Although you can still understand the balance of the characters, know when they\u2019re backwards in the rearview mirrors, you can\u2019t actually read them\u2014they\u2019re no more than shapes: familiar ones, but indecipherable ones. You suck down a deep breath and will your heart to stop beating so quickly. It will take time to adjust to this, just as it took time to adjust to being thrown into a world of English when you first immigrated to the United States.\nA corner of the check sticks out of your purse.\nYou\u2019ll be okay.\nYour family is celebrating Chinese New Year this weekend. You drive with Lillian over to your mother\u2019s senior living apartment; you squeeze in through the door while carrying a bag of fruit. Your mother is cooking in the tiny kitchenette, the space barely big enough for the both of you. She\u2019s wearing the frilly blue apron with embroidered teddy bears on it, and you can\u2019t help but smile as you inhale the scent of all the food frying and simmering on the stove.\n\u201cBongmong?\u201d you say in Cantonese. It\u2019s one of the few words you can remember\u2014as the days passed, you realized that some of your Cantonese had been taken too, its roots intertwined and excised with your Mandarin.\n\u201c(???). (???????),\u201d your mother says, gesturing toward the couch. You and Lillian sit down. A period drama plays on the television. The subtitles go by too fast for you to match sound to symbol; Lillian idly taps away on her phone.\nA few moments pass like this, your gaze focused on the television as you see if you can pick up something, anything at all; sometimes, you catch a phrase that jogs something in your memory, but before you can recall what the phrase means, the sound of it and its meaning are already gone.\n\u201c(???)!\u201d\nLillian gets up, and you follow suit. The small dining room table has been decked out with all kinds of food: glistening, ruby-red shrimp with caramelized onions; braised fish; stir-fried lotus root with sausage; saut\u00e9ed vegetables . . . you wish you could tell your mother how good it looks; instead, you can only flash her a smile and hope she understands.\n\u201c(?????????), (?????????),\u201d your mother says.\nLillian digs in, picking up shrimp with her chopsticks; you scold her and remind her of her manners.\n\u201cBut (??????) said I could go ahead,\u201d Lillian says.\n\u201cStill,\u201d you reply. You place some food on your mother\u2019s plate first, then Lillian\u2019s; finally, you set some food on your own plate. Only after your mother\u2019s eaten do you take a bite.\nLillian converses with your mother; her Mandarin sounds a little stilted, starting and stopping, thick with an American accent, but her enthusiasm expresses itself in the vibrant conversation that flows around you. You stay quiet, shrinking into yourself as your mother laughs, as Lillian smiles.\nYou\u2019re seated between Lillian and your mother; the gap across the table from you is a little too big, spacing the three of you unevenly around the table. As the syllables cascade around you, you swear the spaces between you and your mother, between you and Lillian, grow larger and larger.\nAfter dinner, as your mother washes up the dishes\u2014again, she refuses your help\u2014you and Lillian watch the Spring Gala playing on the television. An invited pop star from the US, the only white person on the stage, sings a love ballad in Mandarin. You don\u2019t need to know what she\u2019s saying to tell that she doesn\u2019t have an American accent.\n\u201cI bet she bought her Mandarin,\u201d Lillian says. It\u2019s an offhanded comment, but still you try to see if you can detect any disgust in her words.\n\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; it just seems a little . . . (appropriative?), you know?\u201d\nYou don\u2019t know. Lillian doesn\u2019t know. You were planning on telling her the instant you came home, but you didn\u2019t know how to bring it up. And now . . . you want to keep your sacrifice a secret, because it\u2019s not about you\u2014it was never about you. But it\u2019s only a matter of time before Lillian finds out.\nYou don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll react. Will she understand?\nLillian rests her head on your shoulder. You pull her close, your girl who\u2019s grown up so fast. You try to find the words to tell her what you\u2019d do for her, how important it is that she has a good future, how much you love her and want only the best for her.\nBut all you have is silence.\nOriginally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, January/February 2018."}

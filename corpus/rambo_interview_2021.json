In elementary school, Rambo was reading Heinlein and Norton, hiding science fiction novels inside textbooks. Rambo attended Indiana University for a year, then took a break and worked in a bookshop, ultimately earning an English degree and a certificate in Gender Studies from the University of Notre Dame. They earned a master\u2019s from \u201cthe second-oldest creative writing program in the United States\u201d: Writing Seminars at Johns Hopkins University; then they began a PhD program at Indiana University, eventually pursuing a career in computer security. They worked in New York before moving to Seattle, and they worked as a manager for Microsoft.\nIn 2005 Rambo quit their job and attended the Clarion West Writers Workshop. That was the year they decided to focus on writing. In 2007 they began a four-year term as editor of Fantasy Magazine, and in 2014 became vice president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA). In 2015 they began their two-term run as SFWA president.\nBesides being one of the most recognizable \u201cfriendly faces\u201d in the industry, and being a seriously prolific short fiction author with works out in most of the venues SFWA defines as professional, Rambo has also garnered a number of accolades. Rambo\u2019s stories have appeared on Locus Recommended Reading lists since the 2000s, and they received a 2012 World Fantasy Award nomination for editing Fantasy. Other notable nods include collection Eyes Like Sky and Coal and Moonlight as a 2010 Endeavor Award nominee, \u201cFive Ways to Fall in Love on Planet Porcelain\u201d as a 2012 Nebula Award finalist, a 2016 Compton Crook Award nomination for their debut novel, Beasts of Tabat, and a 2020 Nebula Award win for novelette Carpe Glitter/\nRambo has lectured and taught at a variety of respected venues, including Clarion West. For more than a decade Rambo has also run their own series of classes: The Rambo Academy for Wayward Writers. Their latest novels are the third book in the Tabat series, Exiles of Tabat (WordFire Press); and You Sexy Thing (Tor).\nISFDB lists well over a hundred short stories\u2014and is probably incomplete (your website says 200+). How did COVID-19 impact your writing processes or habits, and how did you deal with those disruptions?\nI think it\u2019s closer to 300 now, definitely if we\u2019re counting Patreon stuff and/or reprints! It helps that I\u2019ve primarily been a short story writer, which makes the fact that I\u2019ve got not one but two novels coming out in 2021 a little extra weird. There should be another two in 2022 if I stay on target.\nCOVID\u2019s isolation, paradoxically, ended up keeping me productive by connecting me more deeply to other writers on a day-to-day basis. I used the Discord channel associated with my Patreon to create a community where we set up multiple daily coworking sessions as well as social events, like a group to discuss classic science fiction stories, or a \u201cclean and chat\u201d where we meet and clean our working spaces while talking about our lives. Those sessions kept\u2014and continue to keep\u2014me going, but 2020 was definitely a year where it was often hard to get started.\nAt those times, I had to remind myself, more than once, that in 2020, just existing was a victory. In this perilous and interesting era, staying buoyant is sometimes hard to achieve. Turning to my online community was a move that kept me from stagnating. I finished a number of stories as well as a novel in 2020\u2014but I couldn\u2019t have done it without my community.\nLooking at your years of writing, were there times when you struggled to be productive, when you couldn\u2019t sell work, or when you weren\u2019t sure about writing as a career?\nI came to F&SF writing a little later in life than a lot of my fellow writers, which means I\u2019ve had a chance to witness how unpredictable life can be and how much luck can affect one\u2019s existence. I think that gives me a better perspective on what success is\u2014to me if I\u2019m writing and happy about what I\u2019m writing, that\u2019s a successful day. And my superpower is my sense of humor\u2014if you can laugh at a punch, it\u2019s going to affect you a lot less.\nAs a full-time writer/teacher, I have the luck to be able to focus on writing rather than working at a day job, but it\u2019s also an obligation. When you\u2019re your own boss, it\u2019s easy to be a lot harder on yourself than any boss could be.\nBut yeah\u2014there\u2019s always those moments where one wakes in the middle of the night, thinking \u201cHow did I get here and what the hell am I doing?\u201d But I suspect they\u2019re there no matter what field you\u2019re in. If you can\u2019t sleep at all, maybe you get up and do something. And you always know the next day will come and there will probably be some other moments in it that will be pretty enjoyable. That\u2019s what keeps me going.\nFor people who haven\u2019t read your short fiction, if they were to look at one or two of your pieces, which would want them to look at, and why?\nI have a lot of different flavors of fiction! A few that I am particularly proud of are \u201cRed in Tooth and Cog\u201d (near future SF, appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction), \u201cClockwork Fairies\u201d (steampunk), and \u201cMagnificent Pigs\u201d (fantasy, Strange Horizons). I was lucky enough to have LeVar Burton read the last of those on his podcast, which was a huge thrill.\nI do keep a page on my website that includes links to everything that\u2019s available. Two favorite stories from this year are \u201cCrazy Beautiful\u201d (near future SF, appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction) and \u201cEvery Breath a Question, Every Heartbeat an Answer\u201d (fantasy novelette, appeared in Beneath Ceaseless Skies).\nYour debut novel was Beasts of Tabat, published with WordFire Press in 2015, which saw two sequels: Hearts of Tabat and Exiles of Tabat. What were some of the things you learned, in the process of writing and publishing these books, that went into You Sexy Thing?\nOne major thing that I\u2019ve had to learn is how to revise. I hate editing my own work and finding out how to grapple with a manuscript despite that feeling of mingled loathing and terror has been invaluable. By now I\u2019ve got a road map in my head of what the stages look like. I know, for example, that the draft of the sequel that I\u2019m working on will be done at the end of the month and enter the next stage, where it gets put aside for a bit before I come back and begin the first edit, and I know what to look for in that first edit in order to do things as efficiently and effectively as possible.\nAnother thing I\u2019ve learned over time is working with points of view. Beasts of Tabat originally was something like six or seven points of view, which ended up getting pared down to two. You Sexy Thing was my answer to Ann Leckie\u2019s saying she\u2019d love to see a space opera in omniscient point of view, and I am pretty sure that would have been a total nightmare if I hadn\u2019t been used to sorting out plot threads according to which character(s) they\u2019re attached to.\nBut most importantly, the earlier novels have taught me to trust myself, to know that I can turn ideas into a (sometimes incoherent) draft, and that I\u2019ll be able to take that and make something worthwhile. Writing depends greatly on being able to trust yourself, and by now I\u2019ve done it enough to know that I can face a blank page and fill it in a way that pleases me.\nWhere the Tabat books are fantasy, You Sexy Thing is marketed as space opera. What, for you, are the hallmarks of excellent space opera?\nI love space opera! For me, excellent space opera involves an enthralling, surprising, engaging cast of characters, plenty of action and twists and eyeball kicks, and universe-spanning plotlines.\nThere\u2019s a Brian Aldiss quote I ran across at one point, talking about space opera and its sense of fun: \u201cWhat space opera does is take a few lightyears and a pinch of reality and inflate thoroughly with melodrama, dreams, and a seasoning of screwy ideas.\u201d So lots of sense of wonder\u2014but also plenty of people stuff getting enacted in front of that backdrop.\nYou Sexy Thing also wanders into the realm of hopepunk, and my hope is for more and more hopepunk space operas, because they\u2019re just plain fun.\nWhat was the journey with You Sexy Thing? What was the inspiration, how did it all start, and how did it develop?\nAnn Leckie has taught a space opera class a few times for my online school, and in talking about omniscient point of view, she inspired me to try something along that vein, using an ensemble of characters rather than a single point of view.\nThe book was a bit of an experiment for me with a new writing process, inspired by Chris Fox\u2019s 5,000 Words Per Hour. I am not capable of that word rate, but I found if I got up at 5:30 a.m., went and worked out while thinking about what I was going to write, and then came home and got butt in chair and writing while avoiding the Internet entirely (no email, no social media, no texts, no web browsing), I could put out a solid 5,000 words a day. I wrote the book over the course of a month, thinking that I would self-publish it and make it the first of a series. My agent, Seth Fishman, had different ideas about it, and sold it to Macmillan imprint Tor as the first title in a three-book deal, and it\u2019s been a pretty exciting ride since then.\nDid the project change in significant ways from the initial draft?\nSeth suggested a major change that broke my heart and also made it a better book, but I can\u2019t tell you what it was because it\u2019s a bit of a spoiler. I will say that change also had a pretty major effect on the sequel and is part of the plot engine driving it.\nOverall, the draft didn\u2019t change that much. My theory is that the 5k a day method keeps me so immersed in the story that I track it better and make fewer mistakes, and it\u2019s been my approach to the current book as well.\nBack in your 2015 Clarkesworld interview, when asked about editing Fantasy Magazine you spoke about the experience \u201cinspiring an irrational hatred of pirates . . . \u201d Is there an irony in the antagonist of this novel being a pirate?\nThat is totally by design, and you have delighted my heart by noticing it.\nIn the book, Niko and her crew are former military personnel who get pulled into action. What is the appeal of military characters in stories, why do we so often come back to soldiers of various kinds?\nGiven my surname, the narrative of the former soldier, placed in conflict with the system they\u2019ve worked to protect, has a certain resonance. This is something I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about in the last year or so because how do we achieve peace while valorizing violence in the way that our media really seems to? This discussion is so timely\u2014police narratives sure don\u2019t read the same once one understands how complicit American police have been in brutalizing many groups.\nMilitary heroes please us because one version of the stories about them is that they are often people who place the collective good over their own to the point where they are willing to give their bodies, and possibly their lives, in its service. Viewed through another lens, we can see these stories as redemption narratives, where swords are beaten into ploughshares, and those who have destroyed, now protect. Old soldiers don\u2019t just have skills\u2014they have the experience to know how and when and why to use them, and they know that violence may sometimes be unavoidable, but it\u2019s usually not the best solution.\nMilitary characters are also a great place for the story of found family, of finding a place among people who understand and value you. That\u2019s a timely story, but also one that will never get old.\nWhat are your favorite things about Niko and Atlanta?\nThey are two sides of the same coin; Atlanta is Niko at a younger age, trying to find out her place in the world. At the same time, her inexperience and na\u00efvet\u00e9 let me explain things to the reader; the universe outside Pax is wide and full of new things for her. Both, though, are trying to do their best in an often-bewildering world, which is one of the most endearing things any character can do.\nWhat was the hardest or most challenging aspect of writing this book, and how did you deal with the challenge?\nThe hardest part was ignoring the Internet while I wrote those daily 5k word installments, particularly at first, because I was worried I\u2019d miss an important email. But I did learn that the world would not implode if I didn\u2019t answer an email until the afternoon.\nFocus is, I think, one of the most common problems for a writer and it does take being able to envision the end you\u2019re trying to get to. I set a goal of 80k words and rewarded myself with something that I wouldn\u2019t have bought for myself except as a major reward. I collect Breyer horses, and the one that represents having finished the novel is pretty sparkly, both in reality and my perception.\nWhat is important or special about this book for you, what do you want readers to know about it, beyond blurbs and reviews?\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve written a book where the characters are so alive for me that I can talk to them in my head. (When the book deal came through, they were quite excited.) I know Niko and her crew and they\u2019re part of my life now. Book two introduces another character that I just adore, and I hope that readers love my characters as much as I do.\nWhat else are you working on, what do you have coming up that you\u2019d like folks to know about?\nI\u2019m finishing up Devil\u2019s Gun, the sequel, right now and already have a (very) rough outline of the third book as well as an even rougher sketch of the overall series arc, which I tentatively have drawn out as ten books total. I love reading long-running series, and I want to create one where, by the final book, readers are beside themselves to find out how it all ends, particularly the love story.\nI\u2019m also drafting the final book of the Tabat Quartet, Gods of Tabat, and thinking that I might collect all the Tabat short stories and novelettes into one book to come out around the same time. After that, I think I\u2019m done with Tabat for a little while, although another idea for a novel set there has been sidling up in recent months. Jenn Brozek and I also have an anthology coming out in 2022, The Reinvented Heart, which I think is the strongest anthology I\u2019ve edited yet.\nI\u2019d like to get back and finish up a serial project, Baby Driver, for my Patreon supporters. Another book that\u2019s in the pipeline is a middle-grade novel that I\u2019m about to do a pretty major revision of. I\u2019ve also got a baseball novella that I want to get finished up in the next couple of years, and a literary horror novel that is partially written and would like to be completed. So\u2014lots of projects, all of them highly enjoyable to work on! The only real problem is getting them all done. \ud83d\ude42\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

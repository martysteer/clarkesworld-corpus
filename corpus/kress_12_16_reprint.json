She does that a lot now.\n\u201cJulie,\u201d Mommy said, real quiet, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have to share.\u201d\n\u201cYes, she does. Just because she\u2019s now some sort of . . . oh, God, I wish none of this had happened!\u201d Then Aunt Julie was crying, too.\nGrown ups aren\u2019t supposed to cry. I looked at Aunt Julie, and then at stupid Kyra, still bawling, and then at Aunt Julie again. Nothing was right.\nMommy took me by the hand, led me into the kitchen, and sat me on her lap. The kitchen was all warm and there were chocolate-chip cookies baking, so that was good. \u201cAmy,\u201d Mommy said, \u201cI want to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too big to sit on your lap,\u201d I said.\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Mommy said, and held me closer, and I felt better. \u201cBut you are big enough to understand what happened to Kyra.\u201d\n\u201cKyra says she doesn\u2019t understand it!\u201d\n\u201cWell, in one sense that\u2019s true,\u201d Mommy said. \u201cBut you understand some of it, anyway. You know that Kyra and you were in the cow field, and a big spaceship came down.\u201d\n\u201cCan I have a cookie?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not done yet. Sit still and listen, Amy.\u201d\nI said, \u201cI know all this! The ship came down, and the door opened, and Kyra went in and I was far away and I didn\u2019t.\u201d And then I called Mommy on the cell phone and she called 911 and people came running. Not Aunt Julie\u2014Mommy was baby-sitting Kyra at Kyra\u2019s house. But police cars and firemen and ambulances. The cars drove right into the cow field, right through cow poop. If the cows hadn\u2019t been all bunched together way over by the fence, I bet the cars would have driven through the cows, too. That would have been kind of cool.\nKyra was in there a long time. The police shouted at the little spaceship, but it didn\u2019t open up or anything. I was watching from an upstairs window, where Mommy made me go, through Uncle John\u2019s binoculars. A helicopter came but before it could do anything, the spaceship door opened and Kyra walked out and policemen rushed forward and grabbed her. And then the spaceship just rose up and went away, passing the helicopter, and ever since everybody thinks Kyra is the coolest thing in the world. Well, I don\u2019t.\n\u201cI hate her, Mommy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. But Kyra is getting all the attention and\u2014\u201d She sighed and held me tighter. It was nice, even though I\u2019m too big to be held tight like that.\n\u201cIs Kyra going to go on TV?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Aunt Julie and I agreed to keep both of you off TV and magazines and whatever.\u201d\n\u201cKyra\u2019s been on lots of magazines.\u201d\n\u201cNot by choice.\u201d\n\u201cMommy,\u201d I said, because it was safe sitting there on her lap and the cookies smelled good, \u201cwhat did Kyra do in the spaceship?\u201d\nHer chest got stiff. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. Kyra can\u2019t remember. Unless . . . unless she told you something, Amy?\u201d\n\u201cShe says she can\u2019t remember.\u201d\nI twisted to look at Mommy\u2019s face. \u201cSo how come they still send presents? It was last year!\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Mommy put me on the floor and opened the oven to poke at the cookies. They smelled wonderful.\n\u201cAnd,\u201d I demanded, \u201chow come Uncle John doesn\u2019t come home anymore?\u201d\nMommy bit her lip. \u201cWould you like a cookie, Amy?\u201d\n\u201cYes. How come?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes people just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre Aunt Julie and Uncle John getting a divorce? Because of Kyra?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Kyra is not responsible here, and you just remember that, young lady! I don\u2019t want you making her feel more confused than she is!\u201d\nI ate my cookie. Kyra wasn\u2019t confused. She was a cry-baby and a Barbie hog and I hated her. I didn\u2019t want her to be my cousin anymore.\nWhat was so great about going into some stupid spaceship, anyway? Nothing. She couldn\u2019t even remember anything about it!\nMommy put her hands over her face.\n2008\nWhispers broke out all over the cafeteria. \u201cThat\u2019s her . . . her . . . her!\u201d\nOh, shit. I bent my head over my milk. Last year the cafeteria used to serve fizzies and Coke and there were vending machines with candy and chips, but the new principal took all that out. He\u2019s a real bastard. Part of the \u201cClean Up America\u201d campaign our new president is forcing down our throats, Dad said. Only he didn\u2019t say \u201cforcing\u201d because he thinks it\u2019s cool, like all the Carter Falls High parents do. Supervision for kids. School uniforms. Silent prayer. A mandatory class in citizenship. Getting expelled for everything short of breathing. It all sucks.\n\u201cIt is her,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI saw her picture online.\u201d\nHannah said, \u201cWhat do you suppose they really did to her in that ship when she was a little kid?\u201d\nAngie giggled and licked her lips. She has a really dirty mind. Carter, who\u2019s sort of a goody-goody even though he\u2019s on the football team, said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of our business. And she was just a little kid.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d Angie smirked. \u201cYou never heard of pedophiles?\u201d\nHannah said, \u201cPedophile aliens? Grow up, Angie.\u201d\nJack said, \u201cShe\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you wanted a virgin, Jack,\u201d Angie said, still smirking.\nCarter said, \u201cOh, give her a break. She just moved here, after all.\u201d\nI watched Kyra walk uncertainly toward the cafeteria tables. The monitors were keeping a close eye on everybody. We have monitors everywhere, just like the street has National Guard everywhere. Clean up America, my ass. Kyra squinted; she\u2019s near-sighted and doesn\u2019t like to wear her contacts because she says they itch. I ducked lower over my milk.\nAngie said, \u201cSomebody told me Kyra Lunden is your cousin.\u201d\nEverybody\u2019s head jerked to look at me. Damn that bitch Angie! Where had she heard that? Mom had promised me that nobody in school would know and Kyra wouldn\u2019t say anything! She and Aunt Julie had to move, Mom and Dad said, because Aunt Julie was having a rough time since the divorce and she needed to be close to her sister, and I should understand that. Well, I did, I guess, but not if Kyra blasted in and ruined everything for me. This was my school, not hers, I spent a lot of time getting into the good groups, the ones I was never part of in junior high, and no pathetic famous cousin was going to wreck that. She couldn\u2019t even dance.\nJack said, \u201cKyra Lunden is your cousin, Amy? Really?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cOf course not.\u201d\nAngie said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I heard.\u201d\nCarter said, \u201cSo it\u2019s just gossip? You can hurt people that way, Angie.\u201d\n\u201cGod, Carter, don\u2019t you ever let up? Holier-than-thou!\u201d\nCarter mottled red. Hannah, who likes him even though Carter doesn\u2019t know it, said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice that some people at least try to be kind to others.\u201d\n\u201cSpit it in your soup, Hannah,\u201d Angie said.\nJack and Hannah exchanged a look. They really make the decisions for the group, and for a bunch of other groups, too. Angie\u2019s too stupid to realize that, or to realize that she\u2019s going to be oozed out. I don\u2019t feel sorry for her. She deserves it, even if being oozed is really horrible. You walk through the halls alone, and nobody looks directly at you, and people laugh at you behind your back because you can\u2019t even keep your own friends. Still, Angie deserves it.\nHannah looked at me straight, with that look Jack calls her \u201cpolice interrogation gaze.\u201d\n\u201cAmy, is Kyra Lunden your cousin?\u201d\nKyra sat alone at one end of a table. A bunch of kids, the really cobra ones that run the VR lab, sat at the other end, kind of laughing at her without laughing. I saw Eleanor Murphy, who was elected Queen of VR Gala even though she\u2019s only a junior, give Kyra a long cool level look and then turn disdainfully away.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI already told you. She\u2019s not my cousin. In fact, I\u2019ve never even met her.\u201d\n2018\nI stared at the villa with disbelief. Not at the guards\u2014everywhere rich is guarded now, we\u2019re a nation of paranoids, perhaps not without reason. There seems no containing the lunatic terrorists, home-grown patriotic militias, White Supremacists, and Black Equalizers, not to mention the run-of-the-mill gangs and petty drug lords and black-market smugglers. Plus, of course, the government\u2019s response to these, which sometimes seems to involve putting every single nineteen-year-old in the country out on the streets in camouflage\u2014except, of course, those nineteen-year-olds who are already bespoken as lunatic terrorists, home-grown militia, White Supremacists, et al. The rest of us get on with our normal lives.\nSo the guards didn\u2019t surprise me\u2014the villa did. It was a miniaturized replica of a Forbidden City palace\u2014in Minnesota.\nThe chief guard caught me gaping at the swooping curved roof, the gilded archways, the octagonal pagoda. \u201cPapers, please?\u201d\nI pulled myself together and looked professional, which is to say, not desperate. I was desperate, of course. But not even Kyra was going to know that.\n\u201cI am Madame Lunden\u2019s cousin,\u201d I said formally, \u201cAmy Parker. Madame Lunden is expecting me.\u201d\nForget inscrutable Chinese\u2014the guard looked as suspicious as if I\u2019d said I was a Muslim Turkic Uighur. He examined me, he examined my identity card, he ran the computer match on my retina scan. I walked through metal detectors, explosive residue detectors, detector detectors. I was patted down thoroughly but not obscenely. Finally he let me through the inner gate, watching me all the way through the arch carved with incongruous peacocks and dragons.\nKyra waited in the courtyard beyond the arch. She wore an aggressively fashionable blue jumpsuit with a double row of tiny mirrors sewn down the front. Her hair was dyed bright blonde and cut in the sharp asymmetrical cut popularized by that Dutch online model, Brigitte. In the traditional Chinese courtyard, set with flowering plum trees in porcelain pots and a pool with golden carp, she looked either ridiculous or exotic, depending on your point of view. Point of view was why I was here. We hadn\u2019t seen each other in eight years.\n\u201cHello, Amy,\u201d Kyra said in her low, husky voice.\n\u201cHello, Kyra. Thank you for seeing me.\u201d\n\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d\nWas there mockery in her tone? Probably. If so, I\u2019d earned it. \u201cHow is Aunt Julie?\u201d\n\u201cI have no idea. She refuses to have any contact with me.\u201d\nMy eyes widened; I hadn\u2019t known that. I should have known that. A good journalist does her homework. Kyra smiled at me, and this time there was no mistaking the mockery. I had stepped in it, and oh God, I couldn\u2019t afford to ruin this interview. My job depended on it. Staff was being cut, and Paul had not axed me only because I said, with the desperation of fear, Kyra Lunden is my cousin. I know she\u2019s refused all other interviews, but maybe . . .\nKyra said, \u201cSit down, Amy. Shall we start? Which service do you write for, again?\u201d\n\u201cTimes online.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. Well, what do you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cI thought we\u2019d start with some background. How did you and General Chou meet?\u201d\n\u201cAt a party.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Where was the party held?\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to help me at all.\nKyra crossed her legs. The expensive blue fabric of the jumpsuit draped becomingly. She looked fabulous; I wondered if she\u2019d had any body work done. But, then, she\u2019d always been pretty, even when she\u2019d been ten and the most famous little girl in the world, blinking bewildered into the clunky TV equipment of sixteen years ago. My robocam drifted beside me, automatically recording us from the most flattering angles.\n\u201cThe party was at Carol Perez\u2019s,\u201d Kyra said, naming a Washington hostess I\u2019d only seen in the society programs. \u201cI\u2019d met Carol at Yale, of course. I met a lot of people at Yale.\u201d\nYes, she did. By college, Kyra had lost her shyness about what had happened to her when we were ten. She\u2019d developed what sounded like a superb act\u2014we had mutual friends\u2014composed of mystery combined with notoriety. Subtly she reminded people that she had had an experience unique to all of mankind, never duplicated since, and that although she was reluctant to talk about it, yes, it was true that she was undergoing deep hypnosis and it was possible she might remember what actually happened.\nBy her junior year, she\u2019d \u201cremembered.\u201d Tastefully, shyly, nothing to make people label her a lunatic. The aliens were small and bipedal, they\u2019d put a sort of helmet on her head and she\u2019d watched holograms while, presumably, they recorded her reactions. No, she couldn\u2019t remember any specifics. Not yet, anyway.\nYale ate it up. Intellectuals, especially political types, debated the aliens\u2019 intentions in terms of future United States policy. Artsy preppies\u2019 imaginations were stirred. Socialites decided that Kyra Lunden was an interesting addition to their parties. She was in.\n\u201cCarol\u2019s party was at their Virginia home,\u201d Kyra continued. \u201cDiplomats, horse people, the usual. Ch\u2019un-fu and I were introduced, and we both knew right away this could be something special.\u201d\nI peered at her. Could she really be that naive? Chou Ch\u2019un-fu had already had two American mistresses. The Han Chinese, Chou\u2019s party, and the United States were now allies, united in their actions against terrorists from the western part of China, the Muslim Turkic Uighurs, who were destabilizing China with their desperate war for independence. The Uighurs would lose. Everyone knew this, probably even the Uighurs. But until they did, they were blowing up things in Peking and Shanghai and San Francisco and London, sometimes in frantic negotiation for money, sometimes with arrogant political manifestos, sometimes, it seemed, out of sheer frustration. The carnage, even in a century used to it, could make a diplomat pale. General Chou was experienced in all this. Press drudges like me don\u2019t get insider data, but rumor linked him with some brutal actions. He maintained a home in Minnesota because it was easy to reach on the rocket flights over the pole.\nAnd Kyra believed they had a \u201cspecial\u201d romantic relationship?\nIncredibly, it seemed she did. As she talked about their meeting, about her life with Chou, I saw no trace of irony, of doubt, of simple confusion. Certainly not of anything approaching shame. I did detect anger, and that was the most intriguing thing about her demeanor. Who was she angry with? Chou? Her mother, that straight-laced paragon who had rejected her? The aliens? Fate?\nShe deflected all political questions. \u201cKyra, do you approve of the way the Chinese-American alliance is developing?\u201d\n\u201cI approve of the way my life is developing.\u201d Tinkly laugh, undercut with anger.\nWe toured the villa, and she let me photograph everything, even their bedroom. Huge canopied bed, carved chests, jars of plum blossoms. Chou, or some PR spinner, had decided that a Chinese political partner should appear neither too austere nor too American. China\u2019s past was honored in her present, even as she looked toward the future\u2014that was clearly the message I was to get out. I recorded everything. Kyra said nothing as we toured, usually not even looking at me. She combed her hair in front of her ornate carved mirror, fiddled with objects, sat in deep reverie. It was as if she\u2019d forgotten I was there.\nKyra\u2019s silence broke only as she escorted me to the gate. Abruptly she said, \u201cAmy, do you remember Carter Falls High? The VR Gala?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said cautiously.\n\u201cYou and I and our dates were in the jungle room. There was a virtual coconut fight. I tossed a coconut at you, it hit, and you pretended you didn\u2019t even see it.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. Out of all the shunning I\u2019d done to her in those horrible, terrified, cruel teenage years, she picked that to recall!\n\u201cBut you did see it. You knew I was there.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry, Kyra.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said, with such a glittering smile that all at once I knew who her anger was directed at. She had given me this interview out of old family ties, or a desire to show off the superiority of our relative positions, or something, but she was angry at me. And always would be.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said again, with spectacular inadequacy. Kyra didn\u2019t answer, merely turned and walked back toward her tiny Forbidden City.\nMy story was a great success. The Times ran it in flat-screen, 3D, and VR, and its access rate went off the charts. It was the first time anyone had been inside the Chou compound, had met the American girlfriend of an enigmatic general, had seen that particular lifestyle up close. Kyra\u2019s mysterious encounter with aliens sixteen years ago gave it a unique edge. Even those who hated the story\u2014and there were many, calling it exploitative, immoral, decadent, symptomatic of this or that\u2014noticed it. My message system nearly collapsed under the weight of congratulations, condemnations, job offers.\nThe next day, Kyra Lunden called a press conference. She denied everything. I had been admitted to the Chou villa, yes, but only as a relative, for tea. Our agreement had been no recorders. I had violated that, had recorded secretly, and furthermore had endangered Chinese-American relations. Kyra had tears in her eyes. The Chinese Embassy issued an angry denunciation. The State Department was not pleased.\nThe Times fired me.\nStanding in my apartment, still surrounded by the masses of flowers that had arrived yesterday, I stared at nothing. The sickeningly sweet fragrances made me queasy. Wild ideas, stupid ideas, rioted in my head. I could sue. I could kill myself. Kyra really had been altered by the aliens. She was no longer human, but a VR-thriller simulacrum of a human, and it was my duty to expose her.\nAll stupid. Only one idea was true.\nKyra had, after all these years, found a way to get even.\n2027\nIn the second year of the war, the aliens came back.\nDavid told me while I was bathing the baby in the kitchen sink. The twins, Lucy and Lem, were shrieking around the tiny apartment like a pair of banshees. It was a crummy apartment, but it wasn\u2019t too far from David\u2019s job, and we were lucky to get it. There was a war on.\n\u201cThe Blanding telescope has picked up an alien ship heading for Earth.\u201d David spoke the amazing sentence flatly, the way he speaks everything to me now. It was the first time he\u2019d initiated conversation in two weeks.\nI tightened my grip on Robin, a wriggler slippery with soap, and stared at him. \u201cWhen . . . how . . . \u201d\n\u201cIt would be good, Amy, if you could ever finish a sentence,\u201d David said, with the dispassionate hypercriticism he brings these days to everything I say. It wasn\u2019t always like this. David wasn\u2019t always like this. Depression, his doctor told me, unfortunately not responding to available medications. Well, great, so David\u2019s depressed. The whole country\u2019s depressed. Also frightened and poor and gray-faced with anxiety about this unpredictable war\u2019s bio-attacks and Q-bomb attacks and EMP attacks, all seemingly random. We\u2019re all depressed, but not all of us take it out on the people we live with.\nI said with great deliberation, \u201cWhen did the Blanding pick up the aliens, and do the scientists believe they\u2019re the same aliens that came here in July of 2002?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday. Yes. You should either bathe Robin or not bathe him, instead of suspending a vital parental job in the middle like that.\u201d He left the room.\nI rinsed Robin, wrapped him in a large, gray-from-age towel, and laid him on the floor. He smiled at me; such a sweet-natured child. I gave Lucy and Lem, too frenetic for sweetness, a hoarded cookie each, and turned on the Internet. The Trumpeter avatar, whom someone had designed to subtly remind viewers of Honest Abe Lincoln, was in the middle of the story, complete with what must have been hastily assembled archival footage from obsolete media.\nThere was the little pewter-colored spaceship in my Uncle John\u2019s cow field twenty-five years ago, and Kyra walking out with a dazed look on her small face. God\u2014she\u2019d been only a few years older than Lucy and Lem. There was the ship lifting straight up, passing the Army helicopter. That time, no watching telescopes or satellites had detected a larger ship, coming or going . . . either our technology was better now, or the aliens had a different game plan. Now the screen showed pictures from the Blanding, which looked like nothing but a dot in space until computers enhanced it, surrounded it with graphics, and \u201cartistically rendered\u201d various imaginary appearances and routes and speculations. In the midst of the hype given somberly in Abraham Lincoln\u2019s \u201cvoice,\u201d I gathered that the ship\u2019s trajectory would intersect with the same cow pasture as last time\u2014unless, of course, it didn\u2019t\u2014and would arrive at Earth in thirteen hours and seven minutes.\nA Chinese general appeared on screen, announcing in translation that China was prepared to shoot the intruder down.\n\u201cMommy!\u201d Lucy shrieked. \u201cMy cookie\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\u201cNot now, honey.\u201d\n\u201cBut Lem gots some of his cookie and he won\u2019t share!\u201d\n\u201cIn a minute!\u201d\n\u201cBut Mommy\u2014\u201d\nThe Internet abruptly cut out. The Internet.\nInto the shocking, eerie silence came Lem\u2019s voice, marginally quieter than his sister\u2019s. \u201cMommy. I hear some sirens.\u201d\nThree days of chaos. I had never believed panic\u2014old-style Roman rioting in the streets, totally out of control, murderous panic\u2014could happen in the United States, in gray cities like Rochester, New York. Yes, there were periodic race riots in Atlanta and looting spells in New York or war hysteria in San Francisco, but the National Guard quickly contained them in neighborhoods where violence was a way of life anyway. But this panic took over the whole city in a cold February and watching on the Internet, when a given site\u2019s coverage was up anyway, was to know a surreal horror. This was supposed to be America.\nPeople were publicly beheaded on the lawns of the art museum, their breath frozen on the winter air a second before the blood leapt from their severed heads toward the camera. No one could say why they were being executed, or even if there was a reason. Buildings that the National Guard had protected from being bombed by Chinese terrorists were bombed by crazed Americans. Anyone Chinese-American, or appearing Chinese-American, or rumored to be Chinese-American, was so savagely assaulted that the fourteenth century would have been disgusted. A dead, mangled baby was thrown onto our fourth-floor fire escape, where it lay for the entire three days, pecked at by crows.\nI kept the children huddled in the bathroom, which had no windows to shatter. Or see out of. The electricity went off, then on, then off for good. The heat ceased. David stayed by the living room window in case the building caught fire and we had no choice but to evacuate. Even during this horror he belittled and criticized: \u201cIf you\u2019d had more food stockpiled, Amy, maybe the kids wouldn\u2019t have to have cereal again.\u201d \u201cYou never were any good at keeping them soothed and quiet.\u201d\nSoothed and quiet. The crows on the fire escape had plucked out the dead infant\u2019s eyes.\nWhenever Lucy, Lem, and Robin were finally asleep, I turned on the radio. The riots were coming under control. No, they weren\u2019t. The President was dead. No, he wasn\u2019t. The President had declared martial law. Massive bio-weapons had been unleashed in New York. No, in London. No, in Peking. The Chinese were behind these attacks. No, the Chinese were having worse riots than we were, their present chaos merging with their previous chaos of civil war. It was that civil war that had broken the American-Chinese alliance three years ago. And then during their civil upheavals, the Chinese had attacked Alaska. Maybe. Not even the international intelligence network was completely sure who\u2019d released the bubonic-plague-carrying rats in Anchorage. But, announced the White House, the excesses of China had become too much for the Western world to stomach.\nI didn\u2019t see how those excesses could be worse than this.\nAnd then it was over. The Army prevailed. Or maybe the chaos, self-limiting as some plagues, just ran its course. Everyone left alive was immune. After another week, David and I\u2014but not the kids\u2014emerged from our building into the rubble to start rebuilding some sort of economic and communal existence. We never left the children alone, but even so David had found an isolated moment to say, resentment in every line of his body, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to have children. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can go on paying for your bad judgment.\u201d\nIt was then that I got the email from Kyra.\n\u201cWhy did you come?\u201d Kyra asked me.\nWe faced each other in a federal prison in the Catskill Mountains northeast of New York City. The prison, built in 2022, was state-of-the-art. Nothing could break in or out, including bacteria, viruses, and some radiation. The Kyra sitting opposite me, this frightened woman, was actually two miles away, locked in some cell that probably looked nothing like the hologram of her I faced in the Visitors\u2019 Center.\nI said slowly, \u201cI can\u2019t say why I came.\u201d This was the truth. Or, rather, I could say but only with so much mixed motive that she would never understand. Because I had to get away from David for these two days. Because the childhood she and I shared, no matter how embittered by events, nonetheless looked to me now like Arcadia. Because I wanted to see Kyra humbled, in pain, as she had once put me. Because I had some insane idea, as crazy as the chaos we had lived through two weeks ago, that she might hold a key to understanding the inexplicable. Because.\nShe said, \u201cDid you come to gloat?\u201d\n\u201cIn part.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, you\u2019re entitled. Just help me!\u201d\n\u201cTo tell the truth, Kyra, you don\u2019t look like you need all that much help. You look well-fed, and bathed, and safe enough behind these walls.\u201d All more than my children were. \u201cWhen did you land in here, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cThey put me in the second the alien ship was spotted.\u201d Her voice was bitter.\n\u201cOn what charges?\u201d\n\u201cNo charges. I\u2019m a detainee for the good of the state.\u201d\nI said levelly, \u201cBecause of the alien ship or because you slept with the Chinese enemy?\u201d\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t the enemy then!\u201d she said angrily, and I saw that my goading was pushing her to the point where she wanted to tell me to fuck off. But she didn\u2019t dare.\nShe didn\u2019t look bad. Well-fed, bathed, as I\u2019d said. No longer pretty, however. Well, it had been nine hard years since I\u2019d seen her. That delicate skin had coarsened and wrinkled much more than mine, as if she\u2019d spent a lot of time in the sun. The hair, once blazingly blonde, was a dull brown streaked with gray. My Aunt Julie, her mother, had died five years ago in a traffic accident.\n\u201cAmy,\u201d she said, visibly controlling herself, \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll just quietly keep me here forever. I don\u2019t have any ties with the Chinese any more, and I don\u2019t know anything about or from that alien ship. I was just living quietly, under an alias, and then they broke in to my apartment in the middle of the night and cuffed me and brought me here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you contact General Chou?\u201d I said cruelly.\nKyra only looked at me with such despair that I despised her. She was, had always been, a sentimentalist. I remembered how she\u2019d actually thought that military monster loved her.\n\u201cTell me what happened since 2018,\u201d I said, and watched her seize on this with desperate hope.\n\u201cAfter your news story came out and\u2014I\u2019m sorry, Amy, I . . . \u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said harshly, and she knew enough to stop.\n\u201cI left Chun\u2019fu, or rather he threw me out. It hit me hard, although I guess I was pretty much a fool not to think he\u2019d react that way, not to anticipate\u2014\u201d She looked away, old pain fresh on her face. I thought that \u201cfool\u201d didn\u2019t begin to cover it.\n\u201cAnyway, I had some old friends who helped me. Most people wanted nothing to do with me, but a few loyal ones got me a new identity and a job on a lobster farm on Cape Cod. You know, I liked it. I\u2019d forgotten how good it can feel to work outdoors. It was different from my father\u2019s dairy farm, of course, but the wind and the rain and the sea . . . \u201d She trailed off, remembering things I\u2019d never seen.\n\u201cI met a lobster farmer named Daniel and we lived together. I never told him my real name. We had a daughter, Jane.\u201d\nI thought I\u2019d seen pain on her face before. I\u2019d been wrong.\nI said, and it came out gentle, \u201cWhere are Daniel and Jane now?\u201d\n\u201cDead. A bio-virus attack. I didn\u2019t think I could go on after that, but of course I did. People do. Are you married, Amy?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I hate him.\u201d I hadn\u2019t planned on saying that. Something in her pain drew out my own. Kyra didn\u2019t look shocked.\n\u201cKids?\u201d\n\u201cThree wonderful ones. Five-year-old twins and a six-month-old.\u201d\nShe leaned forward, like a plant hungry for sun. \u201cWhat are their names?\u201d\n\u201cLucy. Lem. Robin. Kyra . . . how do you think I can help you?\u201d\n\u201cWrite about me. You\u2019re a journalist.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. You ended my career.\u201d Did Kyra really not know that?\n\u201cThen call a press conference. Send data to the news outlets. Write letters to Congress. Just don\u2019t let me rot here indefinitely because they don\u2019t know what to do with me!\u201d\nShe really had no idea how things worked. Still an innocent. I wasn\u2019t ready yet to tell her that all her anguish was silly. Instead I said, \u201cDid the aliens communicate with you from their ship in some way?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d\n\u201cThe ship left, you know.\u201d\nFrom her face, it was clear she didn\u2019t know. \u201cThey left?\u201d\n\u201cTwo weeks ago. Came no closer than the moon. If we had any sort of decent space program left, if anyone did, we might have tried to contact them. But they just observed us, or whatever, from that distance, then took off again.\u201d\n\u201cFuck them to bloody hell! I wish we had shot them down!\u201d\nShe had surprised me, with both the language\u2014Kyra had always been a bit prissy, despite her sexual adventures\u2014and the hatred. My surprise must have shown on my face.\n\u201cAmy,\u201d Kyra said, \u201cthey ruined my life. Without that abduction\u2014\u201d the word didn\u2019t really seem appropriate\u2014\u201cwhen I was ten, my parents would never have divorced. I wouldn\u2019t have been an outcast in school. I never would have met Chou, or behaved like . . . and I certainly wouldn\u2019t be in this fucking prison now! They came here to ruin my life and they succeeded!\u201d\n\u201cYou take no responsibility for anything,\u201d I said evenly.\nKyra glared at me. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare judge me, Amy. You with your beautiful living children and your life free of any suspicion that you\u2019re somehow deformed and dangerous because of a few childhood hours you can\u2019t even remember\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Can\u2019t remember\u2019? What about the helmet and the flickering images and the observing aliens? Did you make those all up, Kyra?\u201d\nEnraged, she lunged forward to slap me. There was nothing there, of course. We were only virtually together. I stood to leave my half of the farce.\n\u201cPlease, Amy . . . please! Say you\u2019ll help me!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fool, Kyra. You learn nothing. Do you think the prison officials would be letting you have this \u2018meeting\u2019 with me if they were going to keep you here hidden away for good? Do you think you\u2019d even have been permitted to send me email? You\u2019re as good as out already. And when you are, try this time to behave as if you weren\u2019t still ten years old.\u201d\nWe parted in contempt and anger. I hoped to never see or hear from her again.\n2047\nThe next time the aliens returned, they landed.\nI was at JungleTime Playland with my granddaughter, Lehani. She loved JungleTime Playland. I was amused by it; in the long, long rebuilding after the war, VR had finally reached the commercial level that Robin and Lucy and Lem, Lehani\u2019s father, had also played in. Of course, government applications of VR and holo and AI were another matter, but I had nothing to do with those. I led a very small, contented life.\n\u201cI go Yung Lan,\u201d Lehani said, looking up at me with the shining, whole-hearted hope of the young on her small face. Every wish granted is paradise, every wish crushed is eternal disappointment.\n\u201cYes, you can go into JungleLand, but we have to wait our turn, dear heart.\u201d\nSo she stood in line beside me, hopping from foot to foot, holding my hand. Nobody ever told me grandmotherhood was going to be this sweet.\nWhen we finally reached the head of the line, I registered her, put the tag on her neck that would keep me informed of her every move as well as the most minute changes in her skin conductivity. If she got scared or inattentive, I would know it. No adults are allowed in Jungle Playland; that would spoil the thrill. Lehani grinned and ran through the virtual curtain. I accepted the map tuned to her tag and sat at a table in the lobby, surrounded by lines of older children registering for the other VR playlands.\nSipping tea, I was checking my email when the big lobby screen abruptly came on.\n\u201cNews! News! An alien ship has been sighted moving toward Earth. Government sources say it resembles the ship that landed in Minnesota in 2002 and traveled as far as lunar orbit in 2027 but so far no\u2014\u201d\nPeople erupted all around me. Buzzing, signaling for their children, and, in the case of one stupid woman, pointless shrieking. Under cover of the noise I comlinked Central, before the site was hopelessly jammed.\n\u201cLibrary,\u201d I keyed in. \u201cPublic Records, State of Maine. Data search.\u201d\n\u201cSearch ready,\u201d the tiny screen said.\n\u201cDeath certificate, first name Daniel, same date as death certificate, first name Jane, years 2020 through 2026.\u201d\n\u201cSearching.\u201d\nChildren began to pour out of the playlands, most resentful at having their VR time interrupted. Kyra had never told me Daniel\u2019s last name. Nor did I have any idea what name she was using now. But if she simply wanted to pass unnoticed among ordinary people, his name would do, and Kyra had always been sentimental. The government, of course, would know exactly where she was, but they would know that no matter what name she used or what paper trails she falsified. Her DNA was on record. The press, too, could track her down if they decided to take the trouble. The alien landing meant they would take the trouble.\nMy handheld displayed, \u201cDaniel Ethan Parmani, died June 16, 2025, age forty-two, and Jane Julia Parmani, died June 16, 2025, age three.\u201d\n\u201cSecond search. United States. Locate Kyra Parmani, ages\u2014\u201d What age might Kyra think she could pass for? In prison, twenty years ago, she had looked far older than she was. \u201cAges fifty through seventy.\u201d\n\u201cSearching.\u201d\nLehani appeared at the JungleLand door, looking furious. She spied me and ran over. \u201cLady sayed I can\u2019t play!\u201d\n\u201cI know, sweetie. Come sit on Grandma\u2019s lap.\u201d\nShe climbed onto me, buried her head in my shoulder, and burst into angry tears. I peered around her to see the handheld.\n\u201cSix matches.\u201d It displayed them. Six? With a name like \u201cParmani\u201d coupled with one like \u201cKyra\u201d? I sighed and shifted Lehani\u2019s weight.\n\u201cCall each of them in turn.\u201d\nKyra was the second match. She answered the call herself, her voice unconcerned. She hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cKyra. It\u2019s Amy, your cousin. Listen, they\u2019ve just spotted an alien ship coming in. They\u2019ll be looking for you again.\u201d Silence on the other end. \u201cKyra?\u201d\n\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d\n\u201cLucky guesswork. But if you want to hide, from the feds or the press . . . \u201d They might put her in jail again, and who knew this time when she would get out? At the very least, the press would make her life, whatever it was now, a misery. I said, \u201cDo you have somewhere to go? Some not-too-close-but-perfectly-trusted friend\u2019s back bedroom or strange structure in a cowfield?\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t laugh. Kyra never had had much of a sense of humor. Not that this was an especially good time for joking.\n\u201cYes, Amy. I do. Why are you warning me?\u201d\n\u201cOh, God, Kyra, how do I answer that?\u201d\nMaybe she understood. Maybe not. She merely said, \u201cAll right. And thanks. Amy . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting married again. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\nThat was certainly like her: blurting out the personal that no one had asked about. For a second I, too, was the old Amy, bitter and jealous. I had not remarried since my terrible divorce from David, had not even loved any one again. I suspected I never would. But the moment passed. I had Robin and Lem and Lehani and, intermittently when she was in the country, Lucy.\n\u201cCongratulations, Kyra. Now get going. They can find you in about forty seconds if they want to, you know.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I\u2019ll call you when this is all over, Amy. Where are you?\u201d\n\u201cPrince George\u2019s County, Maryland. Amy Suiter Parker. Bye, Kyra.\u201d I broke the link.\n\u201cWho on link?\u201d Lehani demanded, apparently having decided her tears were not accomplishing anything.\n\u201cSomebody Grandma knew a long time ago, dear heart. Come on, let\u2019s go home, and you can play with Mr. Grindle\u2019s cat.\u201d\n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d\nIt is always so easy to distract the uncorrupted.\nThe alien ship parked itself in lunar orbit for the better part of three days. Naturally we had no one up there; not a single nation on Earth had anything you could call a space program any more. But there were satellites. Maybe we communicated with the aliens, or they with us, or maybe we tried to destroy them, or entice them, or threaten them. Or all of the above, by different nations with different satellites. Ordinary citizens like me were not told. And of course the aliens could have been doing anything with their ship: sampling broadcasts, scrambling military signals, seeding clouds, sending messages to true believers\u2019 back teeth. How would I know?\nOn the second day, three agents from People\u2019s Safety Commission, the latest political reincarnation of that office, showed up to ask me about Kyra\u2019s whereabouts. I said, truthfully, that I hadn\u2019t seen her in twenty years and had no idea where she was now. They thanked me politely and left. News cams staked out her house, a modest foamcast building in a small Pennsylvania town, and they dissected her current life, but they never actually found her, so it made a pretty lackluster story.\nAfter three days of lunar orbit, a small alien craft landed on the upland savanna of East Africa. Somehow it sneaked past whatever surveillance we had as if it didn\u2019t exist. The ship set down just beyond sight of a Kikuyu village. Two small boys herding goats spotted it, and one of them went inside.\nBy the time the world learned of this, from a call made on the village\u2019s only comlink, the child was already inside the alien ship. News people and government people raced to the scene. East Africa was in its usual state of confused civil war, incipient drought, and raging disease. The borders were theoretically sealed. This made no difference whatsoever. Gunfire erupted, disinformation spread, ultimata were issued. The robocams went on recording.\n\u201cDoes it look the same as the ship you saw?\u201d Lem said softly, watching the news beside me. His wife Amalie was in the kitchen with Lehani. I could hear them laughing.\n\u201cIt looks the same.\u201d Forty-five years fell away and I stood in Uncle John\u2019s cow field, watching Kyra walk into the pewter-colored ship and walk out the most famous little girl in the world.\nLem said, \u201cWhat do you think they want?\u201d\nI stared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019ve wondered that for four and a half decades? That everyone has wondered that?\u201d\nLem was silent.\nA helicopter appeared in the sky over the alien craft. That, too, was familiar\u2014until it set down and I grasped its huge size. Troops began pouring out, guns were leveled, and orders barked. A newsman, maybe live but probably virtual, said, \u201cWe\u2019re being ordered to shut down all reporting on this\u2014\u201d He disappeared.\nA black cloud emanated from the helicopter, but not before a robocam had shown more equipment being off-loaded. Lem said, \u201cMy God, I think that\u2019s a bombcase!\u201d Through the black cloud ripped more gunfire.\nThen no news came through at all.\nThe stories conflicted wildly, of course. At least six different agencies, in three different countries, were blamed. A hundred and three people died at the scene, and uncounted more in the senseless riots that followed. One of the dead was the second little boy that had witnessed the landing.\nThe first child went up with the ship. It was the only picture that emerged after the government erected visual and electronic blockage: the small craft rising unharmed above the black cloud, ascending into the sky and disappearing into the bright African sunlight.\nThe Kikuyu boy was released about a hundred miles away, near another village, but it was a long time before ordinary people learned that.\nKyra never called me after the furor had died down. I searched for her, but she was more savvy about choosing her aliases. If the government located her, and I assumed they did, no one informed me.\nWhy would they?\n2075\nSometimes the world you want comes too late.\nIt was not really the world anyone wanted, of course. Third world countries, especially but not exclusively in Africa, were still essentially ungovernable. Fetid urban slums, disease, and terror from local warlords. Daily want, brutality, and suffering, all made orders of magnitude worse by the lunatic compulsion to genocide. Much of the globe lives like this, with little hope of foreseeable change.\nBut inside the United States\u2019 tightly guarded, expensively defended borders, a miracle had occurred. Loaves from fishes, something for nothing, the free lunch there ain\u2019t supposed to be one of. Nanotechnology.\nIt was still an embryonic industry. But it had brought burgeoning prosperity. And with prosperity came the things that aren\u2019t supposed to cost money but always do: peace, generosity, civility. And one more thing: a space program, the cause of all the news agitation I was pointedly not watching.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to say that nano brought civility,\u201d Lucy protested. She was back from a journalism assignment in Sudan that had left her gaunt and limping, with half her hair fallen out. Lucy didn\u2019t volunteer details and I didn\u2019t ask. From the look in her haunted eyes, I didn\u2019t think I could bear to hear her answers.\n\u201cCivility is a by-product of money,\u201d I said. \u201cStarving people are not civil to each other.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes they are,\u201d she said, looking at some painful memory I could not imagine.\n\u201cOften?\u201d I pressed.\n\u201cNo. Not often.\u201d Abruptly Lucy left the room.\nI have learned to wait serenely until she\u2019s ready to return to me, just as she has learned to wait, less serenely, until she is ready to return to those parts of the world where she makes her living. My daughter is too old for what she does, but she cannot, somehow, leave it alone. Injured, diseased, half bald, she always goes back.\nBut Lucy is partly right. It isn\u2019t just America\u2019s present riches that have led to her present civility. This decade\u2019s culture\u2014optimistic, tolerant, fairly formal\u2014is also a simple backlash to what went before. Pendulums swing. They cannot not swing.\nWhile I waited for Lucy, I returned to my needlepoint. Now that nano has begun to easily make us anything, things that are hard to make are back in fashion. My eyes are too old for embroidery or even petit point, but gros point I can do. Under my fingers, roses bloomed on a pair of slippers. A bird flew to the tree beside me, lit on a branch, and watched me solemnly.\nI\u2019m still not used to birds in the house. But, then, I\u2019m not used to this house of my son\u2019s, either. All the rooms open into an open central courtyard two stories high. Atop the courtyard is some sort of invisible shield that I don\u2019t understand. It keeps out cold and insects, and it can be adjusted to let rain in or keep it out. The shield keeps in the birds who live here. What Lem has is a miniature, climate-controlled, carefully landscaped, indoor Eden. The bird watching me was bright red with an extravagant gold tail, undoubtedly genetically engineered for health and long life. Other birds glow in the dark. One has what looks like blue fur.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d I told it. I like the fresh air; the genemod birds give me the creeps.\nWhen Lucy returned, someone was with her. I put down my needlework, pasted on a smile, and prepared to be civil. The visitor used a walker, moving very slowly. She had sparse gray hair. I let out a little cry.\nI hadn\u2019t even known Kyra was still alive.\n\u201cMom, guess who\u2019s here! Your cousin Kyra!\u201d\n\u201cHello, Amy,\u201d Kyra said, and her voice hadn\u2019t changed, still low and husky.\n\u201cWhere . . . how did you . . . \u201d\n\u201cOh, you were always easy to find, remember? I was the difficult one to locate.\u201d\nLucy said, \u201cAre they looking for you now, Kyra?\u201d\nKyra. Lucy was born too soon for the new civil formality. Lem\u2019s and Robin\u2019s children would have called her Ms. Lunden, or ma\u2019am.\n\u201cOh, probably,\u201d Kyra said. \u201cBut if they show up, child, just tell them my hearing implant failed again.\u201d She lowered herself into a chair, which obligingly curved itself around her. That still gives me the creeps, too, but Kyra didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nWe stared at each other, two ancient ladies in comfortable baggy clothing, and I suddenly saw the twenty-six-year-old she had been, gaudily dressed mistress to an enemy general. Every detail was sharp as winter air: her blue jumpsuit with a double row of tiny mirrors sewn down the front, her asymmetrical hair the color of gold-leaf. That happens to me more and more. The past is so much clearer than the present.\nLucy said, \u201cI\u2019ll go make some tea, all right?\u201d\n\u201cYes, dear, please,\u201d I said.\nKyra smiled. \u201cShe seems like a good person.\u201d\n\u201cToo good,\u201d I said, without explanation. \u201cKyra, why are you here? Do you need to hide again? This probably isn\u2019t the best place.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hiding. They\u2019re either looking for me or they\u2019re not, but I think not. They\u2019ve got their hands full, after all, up at Celadon.\u201d\nCeladon is the aggressively new international space station. When I first heard the name, I\u2019d thought, why name a space station after a color? But it turns out that\u2019s the name of some famous engineer who designed the nuclear devices that make it cheap to hoist things back and forth from Earth to orbit. They\u2019ve hoisted a lot of things. The station is still growing, but it already houses one hundred seventy scientists, techies, and administrators. Plus, now, two aliens.\nThey appeared in the solar system three months ago. The usual alarms went off, but there was no rioting, at least not in the United States. People watched their children more closely. But we had the space station now, a place for the aliens to contact, without actually coming to Earth. And maybe the New Civility (that\u2019s how journalists write about it, with capital letters) made a difference as well. I couldn\u2019t say. But the aliens spent a month or so communicating with Celadon, and then they came aboard, and a few selected humans went aboard their mothership, and the whole thing began to resemble a tea party fortified with the security of a transnational bank vault.\nKyra was watching me. \u201cYou aren\u2019t paying any attention to the aliens\u2019 return, are you, Amy?\u201d\n\u201cNot really.\u201d I picked up my needlepoint and started to work.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a switch, isn\u2019t it? It used to be you who were interested in the political and me who wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nIt seemed an odd thing to say, given her career, but I didn\u2019t argue. \u201cHow are you, Kyra?\u201d\n\u201cOld.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. I know that feeling.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your children?\u201d\nI made myself go on stitching. \u201cRobin is dead. Cross-fire victim. His ashes are buried there, under that lilac tree. Lucy you saw. Lem and his wife are fine, and their two kids, and my three great-grandchildren.\u201d\nKyra nodded, unsurprised. \u201cI have three step-children, two step-grandchildren. Wonderful kids.\u201d\n\u201cYou married again?\u201d\n\u201cLate. I was sixty-five, Bill sixty-seven. A pair of sagging gray arthritic honeymooners. But we had ten good years, and I\u2019m grateful for them.\u201d\nI knew what she meant. At the end, one was grateful for all the good years, no matter what their aftermath. I said, \u201cKyra, I still don\u2019t know why you\u2019re here. Not that you\u2019re not welcome, of course, but why now?\u201d\n\u201cI told you. I wanted to hear what you thought of the aliens\u2019 coming to Celadon.\u201d\n\u201cYou could have comlinked.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t say anything to that. I stitched on. Lucy brought tea, poured it, and left again.\n\u201cAmy, I really want to know what you think.\u201d\nShe was serious. It mattered to her. I put down my teacup. \u201cAll right. On Mondays I think they\u2019re not on Celadon at all and the government made the whole thing up. On Tuesdays I think that they\u2019re here to do just what it looks like: make contact with humans, and this is the first time it looks safe to them. The other three times we met them with soldiers and bombs and anger because they landed on our planet. Now there\u2019s a place to interact without coming too close, and we aren\u2019t screeching at them in panic, and they were waiting for that in order to establish trade and/or diplomatic relations. On Wednesdays I think they\u2019re worming their way into our confidence, gathering knowledge about our technology, in order to enslave us or destroy us. On Thursdays I think that they\u2019re aliens, so how can we ever hope to understand their reasons? They\u2019re not human. On Fridays I hope, and on Saturdays I despair, and on Sundays I take a day of rest.\u201d\nKyra didn\u2019t smile. I remembered that about her: she didn\u2019t have much of a sense of humor. She said, \u201cAnd why do you think they took me and that Kikuyu boy into their ships?\u201d\n\u201cOn Mondays\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Amy!\u201d\n\u201cAlways. All right, I guess they just wanted to learn about us in person, so they picked out two growing specimens and knocked them out so they could garner all the secrets of our physical bodies for future use. They might even have taken some of your DNA, you know. You\u2019d never miss it. There could be small culture-grown Kyras running around some distant planet. Or not so small, by now.\u201d\nBut Kyra wasn\u2019t interested in the possibilities of genetic engineering. \u201cI think I know why they came.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Once she had told me that the aliens came just to destroy her life. But that kind of hubris was for the young.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Kyra said. \u201cI think they came without knowing the reason. They just came. After all, Amy, if I think about it, I can\u2019t really say why I did half the things in my life. They just seemed the available course of action at the time, so I did them. Why should the aliens be any different? Can you say that you really know why you did all the things in your life?\u201d\nCould I? I thought about it. \u201cYes, Kyra. I think I can, pretty much. That\u2019s not to say my reasons were good. But they were understandable.\u201d\nShe shrugged. \u201cThen you\u2019re different from me. But I\u2019ll tell you this: Any plan the government makes to deal with these aliens won\u2019t work. You know why? Because it will be one plan, one set of attitudes and procedures, and pretty soon things will change on Earth or on Celadon or for the aliens, and then the plan won\u2019t work anymore and still everybody will try desperately to make it work. They\u2019ll try to stay in control, and nobody can control anything important.\u201d\nShe said this last with such intensity that I looked up from my needlepoint. She meant it, this banal and obvious insight that she was offering as if it were cutting edge knowledge.\nAnd yet, it was cutting edge, because each person had to acquire it painfully, in his or her own way, through loss and failure and births and plagues and war and victories and, sometimes, a life shaped by an hour in an alien spaceship. All fodder for the same trite, heart-breaking conclusion. Everything old is new again.\nAnd yet\u2014\nSudden tenderness washed over me for Kyra. We had spent most of our lives locked in pointless battle. I reached over to her, carefully so as not to aggravate my creaky joints, and took her hand.\n\u201cKyra, if you believe you can\u2019t control anything, then you won\u2019t try for control, which of course guarantees that you end up not controlling anything.\u201d\n\u201cNever in my whole life have I been able to make a difference to\u2014what the fuck is that!\u201d\nThe furry blue bird had landed on her head, its feet tangling briefly in her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s one of Lem\u2019s genemod birds,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s been engineered to have no fear of humans.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a stupid idea!\u201d Kyra said, swatting at it with surprising vigor. The bird flew away. \u201cIf that thing lands on me again, I\u2019ll strangle it!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and laughed, and didn\u2019t bother to explain why.\nOriginally published in Sci Fiction, May 8, 2002.\nNancy Kress is the author of thirty-five books, including twenty-seven novels, four collections of short stories, and three books on writing.

By the time he emerged from the clouds, the world had become an azure convex surface, a hint of the enormous sphere it belonged to. Behind, North America was but a smear against the horizon, and Asia was still hidden below the curvature of the Earth in front. The whole globe was wrapped in a hazy glow: the atmosphere. Above him, pinpricks of starlight peeked out of the onyx firmament.\nAs gravity\u2019s pull diminished, he felt the effects of weightlessness. Though his body was firmly strapped into the pilot\u2019s seat, he still experienced the sensation of floating. The spacecraft seemed to be cruising upside down, the infinite waters of the Pacific Ocean hanging over his head and the bottomless abyss of space suspended below. It was as though he weren\u2019t in space, but sleeping under the sea, everything at peace and very far away. For a few seconds, Charles Mann felt he was the man farthest from the hubbub of society, a permanent free-floating consciousness destined to merge with Nature\u2019s pure essence.\nBut soon he remembered\u2014no, it would be more accurate to say that he always knew\u2014that this was an impossible fantasy. Even though he was freed from the gravity of this planet, the whole world was watching him. At least a hundred million people were tuned into his livecast.\nPegasus was in the most prestigious aerospace competition of them all: the Trans-Pacific Championship Race. Freed from the atmosphere, his ship was hurtling at Mach 9.7 toward the western edge of the Pacific. Destination: Tokyo.\nLike ballistic missiles, racing ships entered space for part of their flight so as to minimize air drag, conserve fuel, and coast on inertia, only re-igniting their engines upon reentry. For a few minutes, Charles languidly admired the blue planet slowly spinning outside the porthole, listened to some jazz, and broadcast a mental microblog entry:\nI have never been so far from Earth. At this moment, The World and I are antipodes: I am Self, no longer a member of life\u2019s multitudes on Earth, but a lone wanderer in the universe . . .\nThe cockpit display of Pegasus revealed his position: above the Aleutians. A flock of blue dots drifted westward over the isles, and a bright red dot flashed near the leading edge\u2014his ship. Behind him were more than a hundred spacecraft, and only three in front. This was a decent spot, but not enough to place in the race.\nThe frontrunner was more than sixty miles away, and even the third-place ship led him by more than six miles. As though to remind him of his poor showing, a silver saucer-shaped spacecraft caught up, sweeping past like a meteor less than three hundred meters to this left. That was Andromeda, piloted by George Steele.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Charles? Did you party too hard last night with some groupie?\u201d Steele\u2019s voice burst from the radio.\n\u201cGeorge, I\u2019m just taking a break to enjoy the scenery before I start the race.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid the race is already over for you, buddy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to think so, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Charles pushed a button.\nAbruptly, Pegasus cast off its entire tail section like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis. A bright blue glow flared from the newly-revealed tailpipes, indicating that the fusion engines had been activated. The sudden acceleration pressed Charles against the seat, making it difficult to breathe, but the familiar sensation made him feel more alive than ever. Having discarded almost half of its mass, Pegasus\u2019s velocity shot up by 2.2 Mach, and easily overtook Andromeda.\n\u201cSurprise!\u201d Charles whistled.\n\u201cImpossible! How did you manage to get up to Mach 12?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you in Tokyo, my friend,\u201d said Charles, \u201cthat is, assuming your little flying saucer can get there. Whatever you do, try not to fall into the ocean. I don\u2019t want to break a tooth on your ring when I savor the sashimi at my celebration dinner.\u201d He smiled as he imagined millions hanging on his every word.\nAs if to prove his point, behind him, Andromeda began to shake, clearly being pushed to its limits. Struggling, it managed to accelerate for a brief stretch, a last desperate attempt that had to be abandoned.\n\u201cJust you wait, Charles Mann! One day . . . \u201d\nCharles laughed as his ship pulled farther ahead. The fusion engines were operating at their maximum, pushing his velocity to unprecedented heights.\n\u201cKrinsky, Hamill, Tanaka, let the game begin!\u201d\nLike a figment of a dream, Pegasus passed one craft after another, and soon reentered the atmosphere. The ship\u2019s heat shields activated as the air around it grew incandescent. Like a fiery meteor, Charles\u2019s ship swept across the sky over the western Pacific and descended toward the Japanese islands.\nSomewhere above the ocean not far from Tokyo, Pegasus finally overtook Tanaka Takayuki\u2019s1 Amaterasu, which was decelerating in anticipation of landing. Pegasus, on the other hand, didn\u2019t slow down at all as it brazenly swept over Amaterasu and then Tokyo itself.\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, Mann?\u201d The voice of Charles\u2019s coach warned in his earpiece. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be in Siberia if you don\u2019t stop.\u201d\nCharles began to decelerate only when he had gone beyond Tokyo, sketching a graceful arc as he circled back and landed on the lawn of the Tokyo Olympic Stadium just before Amaterasu touched down. The crowd in the sold-out stadium cheered wildly as Charles glanced around, satisfied.\n\u201cCongratulations on successfully defending your title!\u201d said his coach through the earpiece. \u201cThe medal ceremony is in an hour, so you have some time to prepare a speech.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you accept the medal for me? I\u2019ve got a date with the cherry blossoms.\u201d\n\u201cWould you stop kidding around? Empress Aiko is going to hand out the medals personally! You\u2019ve also got a meet-and-greet with Japanese readers this evening. If you really want to see the cherry blossoms, we\u2019ll arrange something for you tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the empress.\u201d Charles laughed. \u201cWhy should I waste my life on such boring conventions? I\u2019m far more excited by Aoi Masa.\u201d He knew that the empress would be utterly enraged by his mentioning her in the same sentence as the famous AV idol, while Masa would grin, and the millions tuned into the livecast would be laughing along with him. His quote would become the front page headline in all the world\u2019s major newspapers\u2014well, at least the entertainment sections.\n\u201cCharles, you\u2019ve got to\u2014\u201d\nBut Pegasus had already taken off, and as millions watched, it rose into the air and disappeared among the jungle of towering skyscrapers that was Tokyo.\n2.\nSudden pinpricks of pain made Takumi Naoto open his eyes. For a long while he wasn\u2019t sure where he was.\nHe was in his room, of course, about seven or eight meters square. A tatami mat took up half of it, with the other half occupied by a computer desk. There was no other furniture in the room, but then again, these two things were all he needed.\nNaoto sat up, the painful pressure in his bladder making him keenly aware that he had been lying immobile for almost eight hours. Not having eaten for the duration, his blood sugar level was dangerously low, which set off the health monitor on his wrist. If he didn\u2019t eat soon, the monitor was going to conclude that he was in a coma and send out a distress call to the hospital nearby.\nNaoto went to the washroom to relieve himself, filled a cup with mineral water, and returned to the computer desk where he opened a bottle of concentrated nutrition pills. The pills contained almost all nutrients needed by the body and suppressed the secretion of stomach acid\u2014taking five pills was equivalent to eating a full meal. Of course the pills lacked something in the taste department, being closer to plastic foam than actual food, but given that Naoto experienced the joys of foie gras, shoro mushrooms, and caviar every day, he paid it little mind.\nNaoto stuffed ten pills into his mouth and washed them down with gulps of cold water. He turned on his computer and brought up a window into which he tapped a series of apparently meaningless numbers and symbols, his fingers flying over the keyboard. He was, in fact, writing code for a financial management application, an utterly boring job whose only redeeming feature was paying relatively well. However, he limited himself to working no more than two hours each day, an amount of time sufficient to earn the funds to cover his rent and nutrition pills. He wasn\u2019t interested in wasting even a minute of his life on such lowly concerns beyond the absolute minimum.\nI\u2019ve got to work faster, Naoto thought as he typed away. I can\u2019t afford so much separation. This is going to ruin the hard-earned psycho-coordination link . . . I\u2019ve got to get back to it . . . Just five more minutes . . .\nBut someone was calling him. Frowning, Naoto switched over to the chat window, where a chubby girl with short hair appeared: his neighbor, Asakura Minami. She showed him an expression intended to be kawaii. \u201cNaoto! Are you there?\u201d\nSuch useless chatter! \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI have something cool to tell you: Charles is here!\u201d\nMore wasted words. \u201cYes, I\u2019m aware of that. And?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cha-ru-zu!\u201d Minami emphasized every syllable deliberately. \u201cCharles Mann, your idol! Just now, he turned down the medal ceremony to go on a date with Aoi Masa. It\u2019s all over the web. Still, I heard that he was going to be signing books in Ginza and meeting fans tonight. What an opportunity! Why don\u2019t we go see him together? I have a copy of his The Other Shore of the Pacific and I\u2019m going to get it signed\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSorry, no can do.\u201d Naoto didn\u2019t even wait for her to finish. \u201cI\u2019m busy. Work.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re holed up in your room all day working. Can\u2019t you take a two-hour break and go out? And it\u2019s Charles\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on deadline.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSorry. Bye!\u201d He closed the window.\nWhat a silly woman. She just wasted a whole minute of my precious time. Naoto knew that Minami liked him, but after he\u2019d been with famous actresses and models like Elizabeth White, Mariana Kingston, Paula Claudia, and Yang Ziwei, it was impossible for him to be excited by Minami\u2019s round, plain face.\nMoreover, the presence of Minami always reminded him of who he really was, and the last thing he needed was himself.\nNo, it was impossible to stay in this room any longer; even a second more would drive him crazy. Naoto finished his job in a rush, pushed the computer away, and lay down on his tatami mat, closing his eyes. His body was starting to digest the nutrition pills. Even though his stomach protested at the artificial nutriment, he no longer felt so hungry. He could go another eight hours.\nHe initiated the connection and sensory data began to flow over the link. Neural pulses were converted into electromagnetic waves, which were converted into neutrino beams, and then back to electromagnetic waves and neural pulses again.\nVestibular systems synchronized: I am standing where he stands; tactile sensations synchronized: a breeze caresses my skin, full of the warmth of spring and the moisture of the Pacific; hearing synchronized: the susurration of the wind and the sensual twitter of birds; sight synchronized: patches of lively pink and translucent white, coalescing into thousands of blooming cherry trees.\nThe lovely kimonoed female figure kneeling under that cherry tree turns and smiles, her perfect features even more beautiful than the blossoms: Masa Aoi!\nAnd I am Charles, the one and only Charles.\n3.\nPegasus landed next to a small lake near Hakone.\nMasa was waiting for him in a shore-side cherry grove where the flowers were as magnificent as the clouds at sunset. A pure white picnic blanket was spread on the ground, on which were laid plates of refined sashimi and flasks of sake. Dressed in a loose green satin kimono, the kneeling Masa greeted him in perfect English, her voice as sensual and soft as the fabric draped around her.\n\u201cHello, Charles.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Masa-chan.\u201d Charles sat down next to her, his arm wrapping around her slender waist possessively.\n\u201cI saw the livecast,\u201d Masa said. \u201cShall we drink to another championship?\u201d She raised an elegant small sake cup.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Charles accepted the cup and drained it in one gulp. Then he kissed her perfect cheek. \u201cThe only reason I flew so fast, of course, was to see you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh, please!\u201d Masa laughed.\n\u201cI swear. It\u2019s been how many months since we last saw each other? I\u2019ve really missed you.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Masa\u2019s expression was halfway between a smile and a frown. \u201cHow do you explain Claudia then?\u201d\nCharles grinned awkwardly. \u201cUm . . . she\u2019s a lovely girl, of course. Both of you are! You\u2019re both so close to my heart . . . \u201d\nHaving had her fun, Masa switched topics. \u201cHave you seen my new film? I sent you tickets to the premier, but you didn\u2019t show up.\u201d She waited a beat. \u201cIt\u2019s called Hokkaido Love Story, remember?\u201d\n\u201cOf course! You were magnificent, baby.\u201d Charles caressed her hair, which gave off the fragrance of cherry blossoms. \u201cI absolutely loved it.\u201d He struggled to remember the name of Masa\u2019s character, but came up empty. \u201cOh my God, you displayed such emotional range and authenticity in the portrayal.\u201d\nThe corners of Masa\u2019s mouth curved up. She knew that at least ten million people had heard the endorsement, and soon, hundreds of millions would be looking up her film on the web. She could already envision Hollywood beckoning at her. \u201cSo, tell me Charles, which scene was your favorite?\u201d\n\u201c . . . The ending, definitely the ending. I thought it was so . . . moving.\u201d Charles hurried to change the subject. \u201cI thought this was a famous tourist spot. How come there\u2019s no one else here?\u201d\n\u201cThis lake is private. The owner is the head of the Asao Group. He\u2019s providing the spot for our date free of charge.\u201d\n\u201cPlease thank him for me. It\u2019s so beautiful here.\u201d Charles looked around him. The snowy peak of Mount Fuji glistened in the distance, and all around branches laden with cherry blossoms swayed in the breeze, soft, pink petals falling to the placid jade lake surface like rain. Every scent in the air was pure, refreshing.\n\u201cI bet Thoreau would be jealous of us.\u201d Charles took a deep breath. \u201cI think if I were to live here, I\u2019d write something even better than Walden.\u201d\n\u201cWalden? What\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s . . . never mind.\u201d Charles\u2019s grin turned feral as he leaned in toward his companion. \u201cMasa-san, have you ever tried to . . . \u201d His voice was now an inaudible whisper, but of course innumerable audience members around the world shared the revelation in livecast with Masa.\nMasa giggled. \u201cOh, such an adventurer!\u201d\nThe two of them were now entwined on the ground. How the hell am I supposed to get this thing off her? Oh, the knot is back here . . .\nThe noise of an approaching engine broke the tranquility of the lake. Charles twisted his head around and saw a tiny blue dot above the horizon. \u201cOh, I hope it\u2019s not those crazy fans again,\u201d he muttered.\nThe dot rapidly grew in size, and a pair of wings appeared around it. Charles soon saw the Japanese flag painted on the fuselage as well as the English text beneath it: a patrol vehicle from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.\nThe tiny aircraft landed next to Pegasus, and a police officer emerged and strode over to them.\n\u201cSir, are you Charles Mann?\u201d Her English was heavily accented.\n\u201cYes, are you looking for an autograph, sweetheart?\u201d Charles examined the officer. She was young and not classically beautiful, but her fit figure and serious mien gave her an air that commanded attention.\n\u201cMr. Charles Mann,\u201d the officer spoke without expression. \u201cYou\u2019re suspected of engaging in terrorist activities. Pursuant to Japanese law, I ask that you return with us and cooperate with our investigation. You have the right to remain silent . . . \u201d\nMe? Terrorism? What kind of stupid joke is this? Charles turned to look at Masa, but she looked equally puzzled.\n\u201cWait just a minute! What are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cExceeding the speed limit at low altitudes,\u201d the officer explained. \u201cSpeeding beyond Mach 2 is illegal, and beyond Mach 5 is considered a serious threat against the city and a potential terrorist attack. Your speed just now exceeded Mach 10. According to Chapter Seven, Article Eighty-Two of the Japanese Special Anti-Terrorism Provisions, you must be detained and interrogated.\u201d\n\u201cAre you nuts? Don\u2019t you know there was a championship race today?\u201d\n\u201cYes, the race was subject to certain exemptions. However, after the race was over, you took off again, still exceeding the speed limit and outside the race area. I have no choice but to arrest you.\u201d\n\u201cArrest me for speeding? That\u2019s utter bull\u2014\u201d Charles forced himself to calm down. Remember, millions are behind me.\n\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Masa quickly pulled the kimono around herself, got up, and began to speak to the officer in rapid-fire Japanese, gesticulating wildly.\nBut Charles could tell that this officer wasn\u2019t going to budge; he also noticed several other muscular officers in the patrol vehicle by Pegasus. \u201cAll right.\u201d He gestured for Masa to stop and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an opportunity to visit a Japanese detention center. But sweetheart, I\u2019m going to write you into my next novel. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cYou may do as you like.\u201d The officer seemed relieved that he wasn\u2019t making a fuss. \u201cIf you wish to retain an attorney\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlready taken care of,\u201d Charles said, pointing at his head to indicate that his lawyer was monitoring his livecast. \u201cOh, may I have the pleasure of your name?\u201d He saw the name tag on her chest, but he couldn\u2019t read kanji.\nThe officer hesitated for a second. \u201cHosokawa Homi.\u201d\n\u201cHosokawa . . . Homi,\u201d Charles repeated the name. \u201cCan you promise me something?\u201d\nShe looked at him questioningly.\nCharles grinned. \u201cYou ruined my date. When this is all over, you will have to give me another one as compensation.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Charles,\u201d Homi said, blushing furiously. She was so flummoxed that she had temporarily forgotten that Westerners put their given names first. \u201cLet me remind you that it is a crime to harass a police officer in Japan!\u201d\nBut Charles was sure he had seen a hint of delight in her eyes as well.\nThe pleasure of the hunt!\n4.\nIn accordance with standard procedures, Charles was handcuffed and brought into the patrol vehicle under the watchful eyes of multiple officers, who refused to let Masa Aoi accompany him on the ride back to Tokyo.\nThe whole flight back, Charles tried to chat up Homi, who pretended to ignore him, though from time to time she couldn\u2019t help but smile. The expressions on the other officers\u2019 faces grew uglier by the minute.\nBy the time they approached the landing pad at the top of the Metropolitan Police Headquarters building, multiple aerial vans from local news agencies had already surrounded the place. A group of fans chanting \u201cFree Charles!\u201d were attempting to land forcefully, and the police had to divert half a dozen additional patrol vehicles with dozens of officers to maintain order. Everything was chaotic.\nSurrounded by a group of police officers, Charles strode toward the entrance. Homi walked right next to him, and couldn\u2019t avoid being pressed against his muscular body.\n\u201cAt my last signing in Manila,\u201d Charles said to her, \u201cthe crowd was just as crazy as this one. Being pressed against so many bodies was no fun, of course, but something interesting did happen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Homi, unable to resist.\n\u201cThe crowd was mad, shoving and pushing. I was fine, of course, but they managed to squeeze a baby out of a pregnant woman.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s terrible!\u201d\n\u201cAh, but then they managed to squeeze the baby into another woman next to me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d It took a moment for Homi to get it. \u201cYou need better jokes.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth!\u201d Charles insisted earnestly. \u201cWorst of all, she said the baby was mine.\u201d\nHomi snorted and said something to him, but Charles didn\u2019t hear it. A complete, eerie silence suddenly enveloped him, and he watched the crowd squirm around him in the flickering light helplessly. Then, the perception of weight vanished, and Charles felt himself suspended in his own body, as though he was about to float off. All sensation of touch ceased.\nFade to white.\nSlowly, he opened his eyes, his head numb and heavy. Above him was the stained ceiling of his efficiency apartment, and the fan in the computer next to him hummed.\nIt took him a while to remember that he wasn\u2019t Charles. He was only Takumi Naoto.\nNaoto had no idea what had happened. He got up and stumbled to his computer. The web was filled with confused chatter, and countless fans were cursing the police for creating trouble. Not only did they interrupt a hot session with Aoi Masa, but they even managed to somehow break off the livecast altogether.\nSoon, the answer emerged. Out of confidentiality considerations, the Metropolitan Police had blocked the neutrino beam transmission. The world was temporarily cut off from Charles\u2019s livecast.\n\u201cBaka! Baka! Don\u2019t the cops have anything better to do than mess with our lives?\u201d Naoto let out a string of curses and paced around the room. Who knew how long the livecast would be interrupted? Two hours? Eight? More than a day? What was he supposed to do? If he was supposed to spend a whole day not as Charles, then they might as well have poked out his eyes and eardrums.\nFinally, he managed to calm himself down enough to open the programming interface and try to get some work done, but he couldn\u2019t focus, and made multiple errors in a single line of code. In despair, he slammed his keyboard down and returned to the tatami mat to sleep. Tossing and turning, he couldn\u2019t get comfortable; he was like a junkie needing his fix. Every sensation was alien. The feeling of being Charles was leaving him, and his soul, which ought to be soaring through the empyrean, was imprisoned in the disgusting body of Takumi Naoto.\nThe doorbell rang, finally giving Naoto something else to focus his attention on. He jumped up and rushed to the door. The display screen showed his visitor: short, pear-shaped, female. Asakura Minami.\nNaoto opened the door. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d His tone was impatient.\n\u201cI . . . \u201d Awkwardly, Minami lifted a bento box. \u201cI made lunch, and I wanted to see if you want some.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Seeing Minami\u2019s flushed face, Naoto swallowed his ready refusal. \u201cAll right. Thanks.\u201d\nHe reached out to take the bento, but he was so clumsy that he managed to drop it. The box fell on the ground, spilling hot unadon and tempura all over the floor.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d Minami squatted to clean up the mess. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I just didn\u2019t hold on\u2014\u201d\nA pang of guilt struck Naoto. \u201cNo. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d He squatted down to help her.\nIt took a while for the two of them to clean up the floor. Minami was distraught. \u201cI made all this for you.\u201d\n\u201cNo worries. Actually, I\u2019ve already eaten, and I\u2019m not hungry at all.\u201d After hesitating for a moment, Naoto added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come in?\u201d\nMinami walked in and looked around. Naoto felt his cheeks heat up. \u201cI apologize. My place is a mess.\u201d\nBut Minami giggled. \u201cAll men are like this\u2014well, at least that\u2019s what I hear. Takumi-kun, do you spend all day working at home?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Naoto handed her a glass of mineral water. \u201cLots of people work from home now, and my job just requires a computer.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever go out? Or talk to anyone? Don\u2019t you get lonely?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I can . . . go on the web. Everything is on the web.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d Minami gazed at him, her eyes full of concern. \u201cYou should be more active. I think you look a bit too pale. You need fresh air.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\nMinami noticed the massive hexagonal black box at the head of Naoto\u2019s bed. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Just a computing peripheral.\u201d Naoto didn\u2019t want to explain.\nBut Minami had already recognized it. \u201cThis is . . . a neutrino receiver and converter! Are you into livecasts?\u201d\n\u201cHow . . . did you know?\u201d\n\u201cMy friend Rimi has one in her home, and it looks just like this. She told me it\u2019s for livecasts, but I don\u2019t know how it works exactly.\u201d\n\u201cIt receives neutrino beams and converts them into electromagnetic waves,\u201d Naoto explained. \u201cBecause neutrino beams can go right through the Earth, it\u2019s the fastest way to transmit information and minimize delay. But the equipment for neutrino transmission can\u2019t be miniaturized, and it\u2019s impossible to add one to a cranial implant. The only solution is to relay the electromagnetic signal to one of these, convert it to a neutrino beam, and then reverse the conversion at the other end. Have you ever tuned into a livecast?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Minami sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been terrified of them.\u201d\n\u201cTerrified? Why?\u201d\n\u201cTo have another person\u2019s senses take over your brain! I think that must be like being possessed by a demon.\u201d\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d Naoto chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it backwards. It\u2019s more like you\u2019re possessing someone else. You get to see what they see, hear what they hear, experience every detail of their life. What fun!\u201d\n\u201cI guess so. I love Yan Zhenxu and Kim Dong-jun. It would be fun to know what they\u2019re doing at this moment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Yan hasn\u2019t opened a livecast channel. As for Kim . . . let me look up his info.\u201d Naoto tapped away at his keyboard for a while. \u201cAha! He started his livecast last year. He casts for about two hours every day.\u201d\nMinami squeezed in next to Naoto and read the large font text scrolling in the window. \u201c\u2018Do you want to share a body with Dong-jun? Do you want to touch his soul in the vast deep of his mind? Do you want to live with him and work with him, get to know all the secrets of Korean stars?\u2019 Wow! This sounds amazing!\u201d\nBut a fearful expression soon crept back on her face. \u201cI heard that you have to get a surgery where they cut open your brain if you want to receive livecasts. That\u2019s got to hurt!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. The surgery is to implant a chip with a small transmitter, and to hook it up to all your sensory nerves in the pons. Without it, you can\u2019t receive the sensory information in the livecast and can\u2019t build the psycho-coordination link. Over a billion people have had the surgery, almost nine million right here in Japan.\u201d\n\u201cIs it expensive?\u201d\n\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m sure you can afford it. But to subscribe to Kim Dong-jun\u2019s livecast will cost you. Look, the price is listed\u2014ignore the so-called deals they tout here, they\u2019re all scams\u2014998 yen per hour. If you want to tune in for two hours a day, you need more than sixty-thousand yen every month.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot!\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think Kim Dong-jun decided to start a livecast?\u201d Naoto gave a contemptuous snort. \u201cSo many fans are dying to know what the life of an idol is like, to see the world through his eyes and ears, to experience his sensations. Even if he charged a hundred thousand yen an hour there would still be plenty of fans signing up\u2014he\u2019s basically printing money. And Kim Dong-jun is just a K-Pop star. The prices charged by Hollywood stars are straight out of this world. And you can\u2019t even get anything real during their designated livecast sessions anyway. All those parties, trips to exotic locales, charity events, and so on are scripted and sanitized. It\u2019s just another performance for them.\u201d\n\u201cIf that\u2019s true, what\u2019s the point of a livecast then?\u201d\n\u201cLivecasts by professional entertainers are boring\u201d\u2014Naoto\u2019s eyes now flashed with a rare fervor\u2014\u201cbut there are livecasts worth the money. There\u2019s one superstar in particular who basically livecasts twenty-four hours every day, and it\u2019s all free! You can experience every detail of his life, and everything is reality, not reality TV. He\u2019s not one of those empty-headed celebrities famous for being famous. He comes up with brilliant ideas, has impeccable taste, and is a talented writer. He\u2019s also a leading aviator who\u2019s deeply involved in philanthropy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHey, wait a minute. You\u2019re talking about Charles, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m talking about\u201d\u2014with an effort Naoto managed to swallow the me\u2014\u201cthe one and only Charles Mann. Charles, the Man.\u201d He sighed, and his face dimmed.\nCharles, my true self, what is happening to you?\n5.\n\u201cYou are free to go now.\u201d The slender figure of Homi appeared at the door to the detention cell, her tone chilly.\nCharles got up from his chair, his expression indifferent, as though this development was entirely expected. He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s not even seven yet. Why don\u2019t we have dinner together?\u201d\n\u201cI have work to do.\u201d Homi\u2019s voice was still emotionless. \u201cCome this way, please.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you told me that bail is impossible. Why are you letting me go?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of your devoted fans.\u201d Annoyance flashed across Homi\u2019s face. \u201cAt least a hundred thousand of them are protesting in front of the headquarters building, threatening to tear this place down. They\u2019re demanding that you immediately resume your livecast. Half of Tokyo is now paralyzed. I don\u2019t get it: how can so many people worship someone like you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re letting me go because of my supporters?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re apparently not a terrorist, and the brass isn\u2019t interested in pursuing this matter further. We won\u2019t charge you. Now, will you please get out of here?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Charles shook his head. \u201cIf you\u2019re not planning to charge me, why did you arrest me in the first place? I demand an explanation, otherwise I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Homi glared at him.\nJust then, a tall blonde appeared behind her. \u201cThis entire incident was caused by the incompetence of the Japanese police. You must apologize to Mr. Mann.\u201d\n\u201cLisa!\u201d Charles called to his manager. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. What took you so long?\u201d\n\u201cMacDonald is taking care of it.\u201d Lisa nodded at him. \u201cCharles, since you never left Pegasus at the stadium, you were still officially in the race. The proper interpretation for what happened was that you deviated from the race course and were forced to land in Hakone . . . Anyway, the point is you didn\u2019t violate Japanese law, and they had no right to detain you. Since the Japanese police wasted your valuable time, they must offer you a formal apology. We will publish the demand in every major media outlet and reserve the right to pursue compensation through the legal system.\u201d\n\u201cOh, we don\u2019t need to make such a fuss,\u201d Charles said generously. \u201cAs long as this beautiful woman is willing to have dinner with me, I\u2019m willing to forgive the police and let bygones be bygones.\u201d\nHomi was about to offer some sarcastic retort when her phone buzzed. She picked up and listened, the expression on her face shifting subtly. It was a call from the chief of police.\nLisa pulled Charles to the side and whispered, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of here right away and resume the livecast. There are millions complaining on the web already.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? It\u2019s rare for me to get a few moments to myself.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got to resume as soon as possible.\u201d Lisa\u2019s tone brook no objections.\nCharles looked at Lisa, whose expression remained superficially calm. That only made Charles uneasy. When he first started his career, everything had gone wrong. At that crucial juncture, Lisa Goldstone had come to his aid and pulled him through. Everything he did\u2014racing, writing, charity work, publicity\u2014she arranged. Her contribution to Charles\u2019s meteoric rise could not be overstated. But even so, Charles never felt very close to Lisa; indeed, he was a bit intimidated by her, though he also acknowledged that he depended on her. In recent years, as Charles\u2019s stock had risen higher and higher, Lisa had come to manage his affairs with more input from him. Still, whenever Lisa insisted that something had to be done a certain way, Charles felt powerless to resist.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he said with no enthusiasm.\nLisa shifted to a more mollifying tone. \u201cYou know that at least ten million people are tuned into your livecast at any moment, and more than 1.2 million choose to spend more than five hours a day in your stream. About three hundred thousand are practically living in your body and mind twenty-four hours a day. This is mainly because your livecast is almost never off. Your fans have come to trust you and rely on you. Now that you\u2019ve been off air for an unprecedented two hours, many are finding your absence intolerable.\u201d\n\u201cBut they can tune into other livecasts! There must be at least a hundred thousand to pick from.\u201d\nLisa laughed. \u201cHow can they compare to you? You are the one and only Charles. But don\u2019t let that go to your head. More celebrities are getting into the livecasting business every day, and many want to take over your place. If you don\u2019t get back on air soon, I imagine more than a few will turn for their fix elsewhere. Your career depends on that not happening.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . understand.\u201d Homi hung up her phone, and, scowling, turned back to Charles. \u201cMr. Charles, on behalf of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, I hereby offer you our sincerest apologies.\u201d She bowed deeply.\nCharles grinned. \u201cI\u2019ve already forgotten it. But I do have a craving for Japanese food. Would you take me somewhere good?\u201d\nHomi gritted her teeth. \u201cPlease, come this way.\u201d\nLisa smiled knowingly as she leaned over to whisper in Charles\u2019s ear, \u201cThe whole world is watching. If you can capture her heart, I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll double your subscribers.\u201d\n6.\n\u201cTakumi-kun, are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Naoto\u2019s mind had been wandering. He saw that Minami was gazing at him with a look of concern. \u201cSorry. What did you say?\u201d\n\u201cI asked you how it felt to tune into a livecast.\u201d\n\u201cAn interesting question.\u201d Naoto pondered his answer. \u201cAt first, you go through a period of adjustment\u2014that happens no matter whose livecast you tune into. The beginning is a bit frustrating: the colors and sounds all feel wrong somehow, as though you\u2019re watching some 2-d film from the twentieth century. It\u2019s just odd. Although all human beings share similar biological sensory organs, there are subtle differences in the neural wiring, and so you have to put in an effort to interpret the signals being projected into your brain, and all subtleties are at first lost. For several days you\u2019ll feel as though you\u2019re perceiving everything through a film, and nothing feels immediate or real. But then, one day, you\u2019ll have a breakthrough and everything will feel just like your own senses.\u201d\n\u201cCan you feel everything the livecaster feels?\u2019\n\u201cAlmost everything: sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, heat and cold, the sensation of weight . . . and pain. For example, if the livecaster is pricked by a needle, you\u2019ll feel the same sharp pang of pain. However, since the signal is filtered for safety reasons, the magnitude of the pain is diminished. Do you remember the British singer Philip Bolt? Three years ago during a livecast a deranged fan stabbed him more than ten times in the stomach, and he died almost instantaneously. Twenty thousand subscribers who were tuned into the cast suffered along with him, and close to five hundred fainted, with more than thirty dying from shock. Everybody was talking about it back then. After that, they put in safeguards for subscribers to prevent such traumatic experiences.\u201d\n\u201cOh . . . Then, what about joy? Can livecasts transmit the feeling of joy?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . complicated.\u201d Naoto tried to find the right words. \u201cUsually, it\u2019s not possible to directly transmit joy because the emotional experience involves the whole body and isn\u2019t a distinct sensation. However, biological sensations of pleasure can be transmitted: such as the pleasure of eating a gourmet meal.\u201d\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t really know what the livecaster is thinking either.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you don\u2019t. Each sense is limited to a specific region of the brain, but not thought. Cognition, as we\u2019ve learned, emerges from the coordinated actions of all regions of the brain and cannot be isolated to specific areas. Also, since our thoughts require access to uniquely encoded memories, it\u2019s very difficult to translate each thought for transmission. Indeed, it\u2019s precisely because thoughts cannot be tapped into that livecasters are willing to open up their senses to others. This way, they can still maintain their inner privacy.\u201d\nMinami grew even more curious. \u201cI still don\u2019t quite understand what it\u2019s like to tune into a livecast. So you can see everything they see, hear everything they hear, just like if you were living in their body, and yet you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re thinking and can\u2019t control what they do? It seems as though you\u2019d feel like a puppet whose string is being pulled by someone else. That must feel really awkward.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d Naoto was enjoying this conversation, and he was suddenly seized by a desire to share with her everything he had learned about livecasts. \u201cBut remember, feeling like you\u2019re really in the livecaster\u2019s body is only the second stage. The next stage requires you to build the psycho-coordination link. That is, you have to synchronize your thoughts to theirs, and match your actions to theirs, so that it feels as though you\u2019re moving the livecaster\u2019s body yourself.\u201d\n\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s a learnable skill. You have to experiment a bit. First, you need to purge yourself of all distracting thoughts, and habituate yourself to the livecaster\u2019s lifestyle and their way of doing things. Of course you also have to really understand the way they use language. After you\u2019ve accomplished these steps, it\u2019s possible for you to think and act just like the livecaster in most situations. This isn\u2019t as hard as you might imagine. Most of our thoughts and actions are triggered by sensory inputs. Once you\u2019ve accepted the sensory input as your own, you hold the key to the thoughts and actions as well. For examples, if you see and smell a hot mug of delicious coffee in front of you, isn\u2019t it natural to pick up the mug and take a sip?\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . but there must be some things that cannot be anticipated by the subscriber, right? For examples, any sort of high-level thinking or decision-making?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yes . . . that\u2019s why you have to stay focused. But there are tricks. For example, try to empty your mind and think of nothing at all; let your senses guide you. After a while, you\u2019ll feel yourself building a kind of psychic resonance with the livecaster, as though you really are the livecaster.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can build such a deep link with only one livecaster?\u201d\n\u201cTheoretically, there\u2019s no such limit. But ideally, you want to build such a link with only one subject. If you switch between multiple livecasters, it\u2019s very hard to maintain multiple psycho-coordination links.\u201d\n\u201cBut why?\u201d asked Minami.\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you want to be the livecaster? Isn\u2019t that . . . a bit much? You want to understand the livecaster, but that doesn\u2019t mean you want to give up your life to live theirs. And that\u2019s an impossible dream anyway.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is it impossible?\u201d Naoto felt a surge of anger. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even tried it, so of course you know nothing about the fantastic experience of the link, that sensation of the soul melding with the flesh. You would really be living a different life, really be someone else. If you knew what that felt like you wouldn\u2019t be asking such questions.\u201d\n\u201cAll right, I guess I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Minami wasn\u2019t interested in arguing. \u201cBut Naoto-kun, I think you should get out of your apartment more. A gym just opened near us, and I go there every day to swim or play ball. Why don\u2019t we go together?\u201d\nNaoto found the suggestion ridiculous. Earlier today he had flown thousands of miles, traversing half the globe in the process. And now this silly girl wanted him to go exercise with her? What does she know?\nBut it appeared as if Charles\u2019s livecast wouldn\u2019t be resuming any time soon. He needed some way to pass the time. Maybe going to the gym wasn\u2019t a bad idea. It certainly was better than being cooped up at home, bored.\n\u201cAll right.\u201d Naoto nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014\u201d\nPing! The alert ring in his ear was accompanied by a flood of signals into his implant. OMG, Charles has just resumed his livecast!\n\u201c\u2014try to figure out something in another couple of days. Thanks!\u201d Naoto yawned exaggeratedly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m feeling really tired, and I\u2019d like to take a nap.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Minami protested, but Naoto made it clear that he wanted to be alone.\nAfter shutting the door behind her, Naoto lay down on the tatami mat, his whole body tingling with excitement. The bare, cramped apartment now seemed lovely and comfortable.\nWhat\u2019s going to happen next? Will I be with Aoi Masa, Hosokawa Homi, or some other beauty? What will we be doing? How will I spend this lovely night?\nNo matter what, my real life is about to resume.\n7.\nWearing a pair of shades and nibbling on takoyaki in a roadside stall in Akihabara, Charles was thoroughly enjoying himself. Homi sat across from him, the steaming bowl of tonkotsu ramen before her untouched. Even though he was making an effort at a disguise, many of the establishment\u2019s patrons soon recognized Charles. He waved at them in acknowledgement, and from time to time, fans approached for a wefie or an autograph\u2014at least everyone was polite.\nHomi looked around and finally relaxed a bit. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of being mobbed by your fans, just sitting here in the open?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid? My fans would much rather be tuning into my livecast. Even if they could come here and see me in the flesh, I doubt many of them would choose to. Oh, don\u2019t you like your noodles?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I\u2019m just uncomfortable.\u201d Homi\u2019s cheeks reddened. \u201cThe idea that millions are watching us is so strange.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not watching me.\u201d Charles grinned at her. \u201cThey\u2019re enjoying the sight of you through my eyes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like it!\u201d\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t so nervous when we first met.\u201d\n\u201cThat was because I didn\u2019t really understand what livecasting involved. You had to explain it to me. This technology only became popular in the last few years, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s been around for ten years. I was one of the first to start a cast.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. But it only spread to East Asia recently. We Japanese prize our privacy. I can\u2019t imagine having strangers watch everything I do.\u201d\n\u201cNot everything.\u201d Charles chuckled. \u201cI always pause the cast when I\u2019m sitting on the toilet. Nobody wants to deal with the smell. Trust me.\u201d\n\u201cBut everything about your life . . . even . . . even . . . \u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about sex? That\u2019s a biological need and part of our social repertoire. I don\u2019t need to hide that.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s private!\u201d\n\u201cHa! Having the whole world watch you enjoy yourself is a pretty fantastic feeling.\u201d Charles winked at her. \u201cMasa told me she adores it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course she would! That\u2019s how she makes her living.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t kill you to try something new. I\u2019ve heard that nudism is gaining popularity in Japan, and I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen, Mr. Charles.\u201d Homi\u2019s gaze was now infused with a mixture of annoyance and embarrassment. \u201cNot everyone subscribes to your life philosophy. I\u2019m here because my superiors asked me to be polite and play the hostess, but after this meal, we will never have anything to do with each other again. Do you understand?\u201d\nI understand that you\u2019re playing hard to get. Charles spread his hands in a conciliatory manner. \u201cOf course. You\u2019ve got to do what feels right to you.\u201d\nYou\u2019re certainly not the first woman to say something like that to me, Charles thought. Many seemed to have an instinctive fear of being exposed before strangers, but soon, his lovers learned to crave the delightful sensation of being the center of the world\u2019s attention. They fell in love with this way of life and abandoned their old prejudices. Maybe Homi will be like that . . . but if she isn\u2019t, maybe that will make things even more exciting . . .\nThree boys about eight years old approached the pair excitedly and broke the awkward silence between them. They said to Charles, \u201cKonbanwa, Charuzu-sama!\u201d\n\u201cKonbanwa!\u201d Charles replied to their greeting happily. This was about the extent of his Japanese, however.\nThe children continued in rapid-fire Japanese. Charles looked at Homi helplessly, and she was forced to play interpreter. \u201cThey said that they saw you win the race this afternoon, and they really like you. When they grow up, they hope to become just like you, a great aviator and author.\u201d\nCharles gently patted one of the boys on the head. \u201cKid, it\u2019s not that important to fly very fast or publish a book. What really matters is being yourself and doing what you desire in your heart.\u201d\nThe boy replied, and Homi continued to translate. \u201cBut I want to be an aviator. So cool!\u201d\n\u201cThen start as a junior aviator. You can first try a full-body simulator and race in VR.\u201d\n\u201cVirtual reality is pointless. I want to fly the real thing, just like Pegasus.\u201d\n\u201cSlow down, kid.\u201d Charles explained patiently. \u201cIf you really love the sport, you\u2019ll enjoy learning what the simulator can teach you. You can also subscribe to livecasts from me and other aviators, and you\u2019ll learn a lot\u2014well, except the parts that require parental approval to view.\u201d\nAfter answering a few more questions, the children left happily with autographed pictures of Charles.\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly good at dazzling children,\u201d said Homi.\nCharles laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just saying what I really think. This has always been my belief: everyone should be themselves, and realize their own worth. I\u2019m not some idol on a high pedestal demanding to be worshipped. I started a livecast for a reason perhaps different from most: I just want everyone to know the real Charles.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bit rich,\u201d said Homi. \u201cDon\u2019t you depend on your subscribers for your income?\u201d\nCharles frowned. He hated this kind of cynicism. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Whether it\u2019s from my racing or my writing, I make more than enough to live comfortably. My livecast is completely free, and I\u2019ve never earned a single cent from it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Charles shrugged. \u201cMany people think like that, and I can\u2019t change their minds. I just don\u2019t want my friends to misunderstand me. If you know me, you\u2019ll know that before I started the livecast, I had already been published and won third place in the Trans-Pacific Championship Race. I didn\u2019t need a livecast to increase my fame at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that these days there are millions tuned into my stream at all times, but I\u2019ve always believed that I\u2019m not very important as an individual; rather, I represent the concept of livecasting. The practice isn\u2019t about destroying personal privacy, but about sharing\u2014sharing of information, sharing each other\u2019s sufferings and joys, until the entire human race becomes one Man. As subscribers enrich their own lives with livecasts, they gain a deeper understanding of themselves and discover their own worth.\u201d\n\u201cThat does sound . . . reasonable.\u201d Homi was thoughtful. \u201cBut having so many people watch every move you make must make you feel . . . not free.\u201d\n\u201cThat kind of thinking is evidence of lack of self-confidence. I\u2019m Charles, the one and only. Even if billions are watching me, my freedom isn\u2019t diminished by one iota.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re an American,\u201d said Homi. \u201cAmericans are always brimming with self-confidence. This is not the Japanese way. From childhood we\u2019re taught by our parents to live within rules and expectations, to learn to regulate our behavior in anticipation of what everyone watching us may think. The desire for privacy is thus even stronger.\n\u201cI remember playing with my friends every day in a tiny garden when we were in kindergarten. I say \u2018play,\u2019 but in reality we still had to follow all kinds of rules. At the end of the garden was a row of trees, and behind the trees was a wall. But there was a gap between the trees and the wall, though most people did not notice it. I discovered this hidden space one day, populated only by a few clusters of wildflowers. Even though it was a patch of grass no different from the rest of the garden, my joy was indescribable. Every day, I made my way there in secret to play by myself. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to share my discovery with my friends, but it was only when I was there, alone, that I could relax and feel at peace. I could laugh or cry without anyone bothering me.\n\u201cUnfortunately, not long after that my refuge was discovered by others. Many came and trampled over the grass and picked the wildflowers. That tiny world I had to myself was ruined.\u201d\nHomi felt depressed. She had no idea why she chose to say these things to Charles. She had never told anyone else about this memory from childhood, and now the whole world knew her secret.\nCharles was moved. After a moment, he said, \u201cThe others did destroy your secret garden. But they weren\u2019t motivated by the desire to watch you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. It didn\u2019t really matter whether they wrecked my garden. The moment they were in that space, my peace was gone, and I was no longer myself. Have you never felt that way?\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I suppose I did when I was very young.\u201d For the first time, Charles had trouble coming up with what to say. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t felt like that in a long time.\u201d\nHomi gazed at him, a complicated set of emotions flitting through her eyes. \u201cThen I have a suggestion: turn off your livecast. Try to experience your individual world, where every sensation belongs to you and you alone. I believe you\u2019ll feel a distinction.\u201d\n\u201cTurn off the livecast?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you just need a minute to feel the difference.\u201d\n\u201cNo. That would be a breach of my promise to my subscribers\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCharles, I thought you advocated for the belief that you should do only what you want to do.\u201d Homi\u2019s tone was now mocking. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t kill you to try something new.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if I\u2014\u201d\nCharles, ignore her! A translucent text window popped into his view. This was Lisa communicating with him directly over the cranial implant. The text was only visible to him as the livecast software filtered it out from subscriber feeds.\nI was thinking of trying it for just a couple minutes. Charles sent his thoughts back to Lisa over the cranial implant.\nNot even one second. You\u2019re being watched by the planet! This could severely tarnish your image. Charles could practically see Lisa\u2019s no-nonsense scowl.\nHomi noticed Charles\u2019s subtle shifts in gaze and guessed that he was communicating with someone over his neural implant. She challenged him, \u201cI\u2019m guessing your boss is telling you no, right? Oh well\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoss?\u201d Charles instantly felt his cheeks heat up. \u201cI\u2019m my own man. No one tells me what to do!\u201d\nHe commanded his implant to cease livecasting, and mentally recited the passcode to confirm the order. Instantly, it seemed as if a background buzz had stopped, and everything seemed extra quiet. This wasn\u2019t the first time he had ever halted the livecast, of course, but it was the first time he had stopped livecasting for the sake of experiencing what it was like to be by himself. The sensation was distinct. Now, no matter what he said or did, only the woman across from him would be his audience. There seemed to be a marvelous, intimate bond that drew them closer.\n\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Homi asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Charles said, deliberately trying to underplay it. \u201cI\u2019m okay with it.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t that simple at all. The world seemed to have vanished, leaving only him and her, but it also felt as if a new dimension had been opened up to him, leading into a new space that extended into infinity.\n8.\nTakumi Naoto panted as he scampered through a dense fern jungle, a rampaging T-rex in hot pursuit. The very ground quaked with the massive beast\u2019s every step. The dinosaur wasn\u2019t running very fast, however, just keeping pace with him like a cat playing with a mouse. Naoto could almost feel the hot breath of the saurian on the back of his neck.\nNaoto struggled to put one leg in front of the other, desperate to escape from the monster\u2019s jaws. He was winded, sweat-drenched, and his legs were filled with lead. Soon, the T-rex took a giant stride and overtook him; it turned its gigantic body around and opened its colossal jaws, aiming to crush Naoto\u2019s skull with its dagger-like teeth. Naoto screamed and collapsed into a heap on the ground.\nThe jungle and the T-rex vanished; floating lines of data took their place. Total distance: 546 meters. Time: 116 seconds. Average speed: 4.7 meters / second. Measured lung capacity: 1250cc. Health rating: B\u2014 . . .\nMinami\u2019s round face loomed before him. Naoto was draped over the guardrails of the three-dimensional immersion treadmill, so exhausted that he couldn\u2019t speak a word.\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even manage 600 meters?\u201d Minami giggled. \u201cEven I can run a kilometer with no problems. Naoto, you really need some exercise.\u201d\nFinally, Naoto managed to climb up. Gasping, he said, \u201cIt takes . . . time . . . for anything . . . \u201d\n\u201cThen let\u2019s keep going. I\u2019ll make the dinosaur even slower this time. Ready?\u201d\n\u201cNo! . . . I\u2019ve got to . . . take a break . . . \u201d\nThey went over to the lounge chairs. As soon as they sat down, a cool breeze caressed their faces, and the immersion displays around them showed a turquoise ocean whose gentle waves caressed the cerulean sky. Next to the chairs were two chilled glasses of lemonade\u2014the real deal, not simulation.\nThe lemonade and the breeze relaxed Naoto so much that he felt as if all his pores yawned. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt this good in ages. It feels amazing to drink something cold after physical exertion.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you also exercise when you were tuned into Charles\u2019s livecast\u2014no, let me rephrase: didn\u2019t you also experience the sensations of exercise?\u201d\n\u201cYes . . . But Charles has so much energy and such a toned body\u2014nothing like mine. Also, because of the safety filtering that tamps down extreme sensations, I never felt very tired.\u201d\n\u201cYou should definitely come with me more often.\u201d Minami laughed guilelessly. \u201cLet\u2019s go swimming!\u201d\nBut before Naoto could reply, a loud cry arose to the side: \u201cHey! It\u2019s that bastard Charles! He\u2019s finally shown himself!\u201d\nNaoto looked over to the source of the commotion. The projection screen on the wall was showing the news. \u201cAfter disappearing in Akihabara yesterday and being incommunicado for over seventeen hours, the renowned American aviator Charles Mann has reappeared today at noon, accompanied by his rumored new flame, Miss Hosokawa Homi . . . \u201d\nCharles is back!\nLast night, Charles never resumed his livecast after turning it off at Homi\u2019s urging. Completely at a loss, Naoto finally decided to go to Akihabara. But as soon as he emerged from the subway, he saw countless other fans had had the same idea and all the streets leading to that roadside stall were jammed. Eventually, he saw Pegasus taking off and disappearing into the night sky. Rumor had it that Charles had taken Homi away on a pleasure cruise in space, just the two of them. All night, there was no more news. Naoto waited and waited without any result, and finally, utterly bored, came to the gym with Minami. He certainly wasn\u2019t expecting to receive news of Charles now.\n\u201c . . . Charles is declining all interview requests. His only statement is that Pegasus lost power. But according to media sources, his ship had been in low-Earth orbit overnight, and Miss Hosokawa was aboard as well . . . \u201d\n\u201cDo you think they did it?\u201d Naoto overheard someone ask.\n\u201cAre you an idiot? Of course they did it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat difference does it make if they did it? The bastard isn\u2019t casting, and so we can\u2019t enjoy it anyway.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the girl is just shy . . . \u201d\n\u201cLet me tell you, this has finally shown me the truth. Charles may talk all the time about sharing and freedom and all that bullshit, but in the end, he gets to turn off his livecast anytime he wants to. He doesn\u2019t think of us at all. In the end, he\u2019s no different from the rest of the celebrities.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with you at all.\u201d Naoto had finally had enough. He jumped up to defend Charles.\nThe man who criticized Charles was also in his twenties. He gave Naoto a contemptuous look. \u201cMind your own business if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\n\u201cIf you are really a fan of Charles, how can you talk about him like that? Don\u2019t you know him at all? This was most likely the result of an implant malfunction.\u201d\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re one of those fans. A malfunction? Please. Weren\u2019t you tuned in yesterday? He said he stopped the livecast on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but . . . it\u2019s only temporary. There had been pauses in the cast before, when he was visiting Prague and Yangon, for instance. Don\u2019t you understand that everyone needs some privacy from time to time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t worship that poseur like you do.\u201d The young man harrumphed. \u201cThe only reason I subscribe to his cast is to see him in bed with those supermodels. But not only did he not sleep with Masa, he went and found himself a chick cop and didn\u2019t even have the decency to cast the bedroom scene. What\u2019s the point of watching then?\u201d\n\u201cYou are not fit to appreciate Charles\u2019s livecast. How can you understand his ideals and beliefs?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I see, you understand him, do you? Well, looks like he kicked you to the curb when it suited him just the same. I\u2019m through with wasting my breath on dumbasses like you.\u201d The young man turned around and left.\nNaoto sat down, full of rage that he didn\u2019t know where to direct.\nThe news broadcast continued. \u201c . . . Charles\u2019s manager, Lisa Goldstone, released a statement that the interruption in the livecast was due to a technical glitch. Full livecasting has been resumed, and on behalf of Charles, she apologizes to all the fans for the inconvenience . . . \u201d\n\u201cNaoto, are you going to rush home for the livecast?\u201d Minami asked, careful to keep her tone neutral.\n\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Naoto shouted at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\u201cI was just asking,\u201d Minami muttered. \u201cWhy are you screaming at me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Naoto forced himself to calm down. \u201cI\u2019m just . . . \u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say and collapsed back onto the lounge chair.\nSilently, Naoto fumed at Charles. Why did you stop the livecast? Why did you cut off the psychic link between us? Recently, he could almost feel himself completely melding with Charles soul to soul, and when Charles said that he wanted to stop the livecast, Naoto had almost wanted to cheer, not realizing that it meant that he would also be shut out. And a second later, he had been tossed back into his bare efficiency apartment, all alone.\nOnly then did the painful realization come that he was never going to be Charles, just a ghostly parasite attached to Charles.\nFor the last three years, Naoto was tuned into Charles\u2019s cast almost continuously. Every day, he lived Charles\u2019s life, facing everything he faced, participating in his races, planning and drafting and revising his books, until he could speak American English better than Japanese, until he had almost forgotten who he was. As long as he thought of himself as Charles, it was possible to scale one life\u2019s peak after another, be a guest at the world\u2019s most exclusive parties, travel the world, live in seven-star hotels, bathe in the fervor of fans, hop from the bed of one hot woman to another . . .\nBut these were not the most important. The real joys were the sense of personal worth, the spirit of freedom, and a lifestyle enabled by boundless self-confidence embodied by Charles Mann. Only when he was in Charles\u2019s body did he feel he was alive. In his own life, he was just Takumi Naoto, a programmer in a dead-end job, a failure whose life was devoid of excitement, who was estranged from his parents, whose girlfriend had left him for another man, who didn\u2019t even have a single real friend. A few years ago, he had contemplated suicide. If Charles\u2019s livecast hadn\u2019t come along to save him, Naoto would have long passed the slope of Yomotsu Hirasaka and entered the underworld.\nCharles gave him a new life and hope, and resculpted his soul so that he believed that he could possess a life with value and dignity. But everything had changed. Yesterday made Naoto realize that Charles could cease livecasting at any moment, cut off this link that to him was inseverable. Everything he had thought about Charles had just been his own fantasy. Even if he possessed a soul just like Charles\u2019s, he could never have his life.\nHe was still just Takumi Naoto, just himself. However, today\u2019s experiences made him feel that being Naoto from time to time wasn\u2019t so bad. Of course, he would still tune into Charles\u2019s cast, but not right now.\nHaving made his decision, he got up and stretched. \u201cMinami, let\u2019s run some more. My goal is three kilometers today.\u201d\n\u201cAll right!\u201d She laughed in delight.\n9.\n\u201cCharles, I\u2019m going to say it just one more time: You cannot do this!\u201d Lisa was screaming at him through the phone.\n\u201cLisa, I\u2019ve already told you at least ten times: my time with Homi will never be livecast. This is my decision.\u201d\n\u201cThat means you\u2019re livecasting for no more than eight hours a day. This is going to break the bond between you and your fans. Your ratings have taken a nosedive this month, and last week the number of viewers tuned into your livecast fell below two million. You were once alone at the top of the ratings, and now you\u2019re not even in the top ten. Wake up, Charles! Even that Chinese clown, Baby Phoenix, has more subscribers than you.\u201d\n\u201cFine, let them go follow Baby Phoenix. What does it matter to me?\u201d\n\u201cCharles.\u201d With visible effort, Lisa managed to contain her impatience. \u201cListen, we need to have a real discussion, as soon as possible.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it another day,\u201d Charles said. \u201cHomi and I are celebrating our 100-day anniversary tonight. I don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\nCharles disconnected.\nHomi, who was standing across from him, asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. Just work stuff.\u201d\n\u201cThen let\u2019s continue. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\nHomi grabbed hold of him. Charles went for her waist, and she leaned into him compliantly. Watching her shy, smiling face, Charles\u2019s concentration wavered. Suddenly, Homi wriggled out of his grasp, and he felt her weight pushing him off balance over her leg as he collapsed to the mat.\n\u201cHa! You lost again!\u201d\nCharles was glad that there was no livecast to show his humiliating wrestling defeat at the hands of someone weighing at least 80 pounds less than he did. Of course, these were hardly fair contests, as Homi was a professionally trained fighter.\n\u201cI think you need to admit defeat, and it\u2019s \u2018pony time!\u2019\u201d said Homi, her eyes flashing mischievously.\nCharles sighed and got on all fours, and with a delighted whoop Homi jumped on his back and guided her new mount around the room.\nWhat had happened to the suave, slick Charles who once boasted of never sleeping with the same woman two nights in a row?\nOn that day more than three months ago, after Charles shut off the livecast, confused fans had surrounded Charles and Homi in Akihabara. In the end, the pair had to escape by taking off in Pegasus. But Charles had forgotten the fact that his ship was almost out of fuel, and once they reached orbit they were stuck. Charles then turned on the livecast to call for aid, only to realize that there wasn\u2019t even enough juice to power the neutrino converter, cutting them off from the rest of the world. A simple postprandial stroll had thus turned into a little castaway adventure in space.\nFortunately, the experience brought the pair together. Homi had never been to space, and as they drifted in near-weightlessness, she didn\u2019t even know how to take a sip of water, leading to many embarrassing situations. They did not, in fact, \u201cdo it\u201d on that first night together. But after they returned to Earth, Charles arrived in Japan several days later with a Pegasus full of roses, and finally managed to convince Homi to go on a second date with him . . .\nHomi imposed one condition: no livecasting while they were on dates. Charles agreed right away. And soon, he discovered a novel pleasure in this secret relationship. He ended up doing many things he had never thought of doing before: meowing at Homi like a cat, whispering ridiculous lovers\u2019 prattle that made even him blush, horsing around like a couple of kids, doing whatever felt fun and relaxing at the moment instead of trying to perform as the perfect lover while the whole world watched.\nYears earlier, Charles had lived in such a carefree manner, but he had forgotten that past self during the years of continuous livecasting.\nTonight, in the new cabin that Charles had bought on the shore of the lake in Hakone, they were just a relaxed couple enjoying their time together. It wasn\u2019t particularly romantic or exciting, but they were free to be as silly as they wanted.\n\u201cListen, baby, your ride needs a break,\u201d Charles said. He twisted, dislodging the protesting Homi from his back, and then rolled until she was under him. He kissed her neck with fervor. \u201cAnata,\u201d he whispered\u2014the \u2018pony\u2019s\u2019 Japanese had been improving under expert guidance\u2014\u201cLet me . . . \u201d\nHomi moaned and her eyes lost focus as she licked her lips in anticipation. The whole night lay ahead, and this cabin belonged just to the two of them with no stranger\u2019s gaze . . .\nHe reached out to unfasten her gi. But his hand stopped and pulled back\u2014\n\u2014and slapped hard against Homi\u2019s cheek.\nHomi\u2019s smile was frozen. She was stunned and unable to speak, staring at him in utter disbelief.\n\u201cWhat in the world is wrong with you?\u201d she finally managed after a few seconds.\nCharles\u2019s features twisted into a hideous, savage expression, the muscles of his face twitching. He lifted an arm and pointed at the door. \u201cGet out of here. Now!\u201d\n\u201cHow can you speak to me\u2014\u201d\nHe shoved at her roughly. \u201cGet out!\u201d\nAfter staring at him for an interminable moment, Homi got up and put on her coat. \u201cCharles, you really are an asshole.\u201d She kicked him hard in the crotch and then hurried out the door.\nThe pain from his lower body doubled Charles over, and then he fell to his hands and knees. His throat spasmed and he coughed violently, as if he needed to expectorate his innards. His eyes filled with tears, and his limbs jerked uncontrollably in cramped agony. He didn\u2019t know how long he was seized by such physical suffering. It was only after he had recovered that he saw a pair of slender legs in a pair of bright red high heels in front of him.\nHe looked up and saw a familiar face.\n\u201cLisa?\u201d He struggled to get up. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cSince you wouldn\u2019t see me, I had no choice but to come to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut how did you know I was here? I shut off all location services and\u2014\u201d\nLisa didn\u2019t answer his query but posed a question of her own. \u201cHow does it feel to get rid of your girlfriend with a good, hard slap to the face?\u201d\nCharles\u2019s vision blurred. \u201cHow did you know\u2014wait, did you . . . did you\u2014\u201d\nGently caressing his face, Lisa said in a pitying tone, \u201cCharles, my dear Charles, don\u2019t blame me. You made me do it. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d\nHis worst fear had been confirmed. Eyes wide in shock, Charles muttered, \u201cOh my God, I didn\u2019t know you could control my body through the implant . . . But, how could the chip . . . I thought it was just a transmitter.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018just a transmitter.\u2019 Others are able to receive your brain activities through neutrino beams, and you\u2019re also able to receive brain activity signals.\u201d\n\u201cBut I thought it was limited to sensory input\u2014\u201d\nLisa\u2019s look was a mixture of pity and contempt. \u201cThere are so many things you don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s start from the beginning. Do you remember the autumn ten years ago? That was the year after your first race, when you did unexpectedly well. You had spent hundreds of thousands to outfit your ship, thinking that you could win a championship. The result? You didn\u2019t even place, losing all your investment. You were on the verge of giving up your dream of being an aviator and returning home to Tennessee to be a farmer just like your father.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I remember.\u201d Charles said. Lisa had found him, almost passed out, in a little dive bar. She told him that she worked for an experimental neural research institute, where they were testing a new cranial implant device that could allow different people to share sensory perceptions. If Charles volunteered to be a subject, they\u2019d pay him two hundred thousand dollars. And if the experiments caused irreversible damage to his health, they\u2019d compensate him with even more money. In order to raise the funds for the next race, Charles accepted. And soon, they began the first trial livecast with him.\n\u201cIn reality, what I told you was not the real experiment at all,\u201d said Lisa. \u201cFifteen years ago, Bell Labs invented a new direct neural interface chip capable of being implanted into the pons. The original intent was to implement a mind-machine interface, but the results were less than ideal. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that the implant did allow the sharing of brain activity patterns between different subjects. Before you, we had already conducted multiple trials on animals and humans with excellent results. But this transformative technology lacked a suitable application. No one wanted to cut open their brain to insert a metal box that would transmit their brainwaves to other people, though they weren\u2019t against tapping into other people\u2019s brainwaves.\n\u201cIn order to popularize this technology, we found a few subjects and compensated them handsomely to become livecasters. But once that was done, no more than a few extremely curious individuals were interested in the constant goings on in the lives of ordinary people\u2014especially since the cost involved surgery.\n\u201cWe needed a celebrity livecaster to present a compelling use case for the technology. The celebrity\u2019s fans could bring along more early adapters until a market emerged.\n\u201cWe got in touch with multiple movie stars, athletes, and prominent authors, but unfortunately, no one wanted to do it. This wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected. If you were already famous and successful with a good life, why would you take the risk of drilling a hole in your skull to add some gizmo just so that strangers could peek into your head? We needed to create someone specifically for the purpose of catalyzing this new technology revolution. The management decided that we had to find a young person with potential and then package him, craft him, and advertise him until he became the spokesperson for livecasting.\u201d\n10.\n\u201cAnd so you found me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lisa said. \u201cYou were already semi-famous, but your career was stalled in a tough spot. You needed money, and you were willing to undergo surgery to get it. You craved the feeling of being worshipped by the crowd, and so you wouldn\u2019t be opposed to the idea of livecasting. You are blessed with good looks as well as easy and open manners. As long as your career took off, it was easy to see that more and more people would be attracted to your life. To be able to become the coolest and most relevant person in the world with little effort is a temptation few can resist.\u201d\n\u201cI see. But how did you know that I would be so successful in the future?\u201d\n\u201cHa!\u201d Lisa was shaking her head. \u201cMy dear Charles, you\u2019re such a narcissist. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d\nA cold sweat broke out on Charles\u2019s back as the truth pressed against an old, insecure wound in his psyche, but Lisa ripped off the last bandage concealing the truth without mercy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know, of course. You were just one of many candidates who made it through our selection process. The fact that you were chosen was purely by accident. Had we picked any of the others, we would have been able to engineer their incredible success as well. Charles, you were never successful because of your own efforts\u2014without us, you would be nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. Of course the livecasting has helped my career, but I worked hard for my success!\u201d\n\u201cYou worked hard?\u201d Lisa chortled. \u201cCharles, you\u2019ve been enjoying a marvelous fantasy for ten years, but it\u2019s time to wake up to reality. Do you really think you\u2019re some once-in-a-century aviation genius? Your experience and skill as a pilot are only secondary contributors to your numerous racing trophies\u2014the real reason you won is because you possessed the most expensive and advanced racing craft. You can afford to hire the world\u2019s foremost aviation experts and engineers. Your victories are bought. I bet if you left Pegasus on autopilot it would still win most races.\u201d\nCharles\u2019s face was now crimson and throbbing, but he couldn\u2019t find an effective retort. \u201cEven if . . . even if that were true, I used my own money! I\u2019m the spokesperson for several spacecraft and aircraft manufacturers, and I earn plenty of sponsorships for my races.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just arguing the question of whether the chicken or the egg came first. Who arranged those sponsorships for you? Who got you in front of the advertising executives? Who convinced them to back you instead of a rival? Think about it: you get the newest prototypes for experimental craft as soon as they emerge from the wind tunnel; you have access to the latest engine technology and avionics; you enjoy the most ergonomic hull interior design and air filtration systems, customized and assembled by the most experienced engineers on the planet\u2014do you really think you\u2019re entitled to all these advantages with no hustle from anyone? Charles, you\u2019re not stupid, but years of being surrounded by applause and constant praise have blinded you to the way things really are.\u201d\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just a puppet . . . with you and Bell Labs pulling the strings?\u201d Charles felt his world crumble around him. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought you more than a bit odd. At first you told me you were a representative from Bell Labs, and then you worked at the implant start-up before becoming my professional manager\u2014who\u2019s the one giving you orders?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pointless question, and the answer won\u2019t mean a thing to you anyway. Bell Labs, Cartel Nanotech, Connally Entertainment, Griffin Media, Douglas Astronautics, Springer Publishing, Time Media, Pacific TV & VR, Foundation for Democracy in America . . . the companies and organizations who have invested in you are members of a common interest community, but no single entity calls the shots. If you insist on identifying a puppeteer, it\u2019s neither the US government nor Wall Street\u2014it\u2019s capital itself. You\u2019re the most important link in the system, but you\u2019re not independent. Your pathetic attempt to make your own decisions is harming the interests of the entire community.\u201d\n\u201cJust because I stopped my livecast?\u201d Charles laughed helplessly. \u201cBut you\u2019ve already gotten your technology revolution and new market. There are more than a hundred thousand livecasting right now. Why don\u2019t you let me go?\u201d\n\u201cBut no one can compare to you, Charles. Even though we now have many livecasters, few are willing to do so 24 hours a day, and among them you\u2019re the most significant. You\u2019re the first idol we created for the livecasting age. People might go view a third-rate fad like Baby Phoenix out of curiosity for the exotic, but you embody the dream of billions with your life. There is no substitute for you in the livecasting industry. Your book My So-Called Livecast Life has sold more than three hundred million copies! You symbolize a new way of life.\n\u201cIf you go back to casting only from time to time, then livecasting will never be more than mere entertainment, and not nearly as many would be infatuated with it. It might take us ten, twenty years to recover from such a setback.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were very good at building up idols,\u201d said Charles. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just make another Charles?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should we repeat the work we\u2019ve already done? You\u2019re now the world\u2019s most prominent brand. Take your novels, for example: every one of them sells at least thirty million copies. But if the name of Jackson Smith were on the covers, I don\u2019t imagine we\u2019d move more than a few thousand.\u201d\n\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Charles was unnerved by where this was going. He stared at Lisa. \u201cWho\u2019s Jackson Smith?\u201d\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t know him.\u201d Lisa waved his question away like a buzzing fly. \u201cJackson Daniel Smith, graduate of UT Austin, a failed novelist and former Hollywood scriptwriter, was the author of two novels published under his own name whose total sales never broke ten thousand. You can also find his name attached to a few B movies that no one has heard of. Twice divorced and bald by the time he was forty\u2014oh, let me just add that he\u2019s also the author of most of your novels.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!?\u201d Charles was sure Lisa had gone too far. \u201cWhat kind of bullshit is this?\u201d\n\u201cCalm down. Think about it: before you got the cranial implant, you thought of yourself as a connoisseur of literature and published some online essays and short stories, but you never managed to even finish a novel. How could you have published your breakout debut, The Parthenon, the very next year?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does when I began writing have to do with you? What are you trying to prove?\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to your composition process, shall we? For every one of your acclaimed novels, don\u2019t you remember how the key plot points and wonderful twists seemed to just appear in your brain out of nowhere? Did you think you were communing with your muse? In reality, inspiration is also a sensory phenomenon. There\u2019s a part of your brain, right here in the frontal lobe, which is the site of your sense of self and integrated cognition. That part is generally thought of as inviolable\u2014not that we can\u2019t get into it, but if we did, you\u2019d become a patient in the psych ward. The rest of your brain, whether we\u2019re talking about the sensory or motor cortices, or even the language center, can be stimulated with neural patterns from corresponding regions of other brains. We took Smith\u2019s ideas and beamed the same patterns into your language center, where they triggered similar concepts. When the neural impulses were combined in the frontal lobe, your consciousness chooses to interpret the inspirations as your own.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201d Charles was now screaming at her. \u201cThose inspired strokes . . . they were mine! I stayed up late and got up early for them . . . that feeling of creativity . . . how . . . how can they belong to this Smith?\u201d\n\u201cIn the future, there will no longer be any so-called \u2018self,\u2019\u201d said Lisa. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing more than an illusion created by a small cluster of decision neurons in the frontal lobe, but we, naively, thought of it as the soul that encompassed the senses, emotions, and all cognition. The livecasting age is going to tear away these illusions. You\u2019re the pioneer of this brave new age, Charles, the apostle of a fresh epoch.\u201d\nCharles was now curled up in a corner. A bout of hysterical laughter burst from him. \u201cOh, you\u2019re a real comedian, aren\u2019t you? You spend half the night ripping me apart and telling me that I\u2019m a useless puppet, all my proud accomplishments nothing more than illusions. Yet now you call me an apostle?\u201d\n\u201cReality is frequently painful,\u201d said Lisa. \u201cBut you must press on down this path. Very soon you will come to understand that whether you\u2019re a genius or a fool isn\u2019t so important. What matters is who do you feel you are? Even if those ideas came from Jackson Smith, as long as you really felt that you came up with them, that was enough to satisfy your need to be creative, wasn\u2019t it?\n\u201cIn our world, there are tens of millions who can feel that they are you, Charles, the Man. They couldn\u2019t care less who they really are. Millions have become you, melding completely with you. You endow their meaningless lives with hope. Their ranks will continue to swell because no one can resist the temptation. As we improve and perfect the technology for translating and transmitting neural patterns, millions more\u2014billions\u2014will join the livecasting revolution, and they won\u2019t be able to stop. In the not too distant future, I\u2019m certain we can enable the transmission and reception of more complicated senses and emotions, or even fully formed thoughts. No one can predict how far the technology will ultimately develop, but this is surely the beginning of a true singularity. The traditional life of an individual will be swept away, replaced by a new world we have yet to imagine.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not my ideal. I\u2019ve always wanted everyone to become their true selves, to pursue their own values.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lisa shook her head emphatically. \u201cEven your most devoted fans, deep down, want to become you. Not many of them want to be themselves. This is human nature.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Charles gritted his teeth. \u201cSince everything about me is false, illusory, at least my beliefs are real. I won\u2019t give that up. I will reveal everything you\u2019ve told me to the world.\u201d\nHe tried to turn on the livecast, but nothing happened.\n\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d said Lisa. \u201cWe always have more than a dozen people monitoring everything you do. No matter where you are or when, as soon as you even say more than three words that we don\u2019t like, we\u2019ll activate our remote control and make you babble utter nonsense that will get you committed. Have you forgotten how you drove your girlfriend away?\u201d\nCharles dropped his face into his hands and collapsed back to the floor. \u201cIf you\u2019re so powerful, why not just take over my body and start pulling on the strings? You can then make me say what you want and dance to your tune.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t yet have that level of technology. The sensory cortices and the motor cortices are distinct, and the necessary inputs and computations to fully direct your limbs are complicated. It took almost everything we had to make you say those words to Homi just now, and you didn\u2019t sound natural at all.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that Homi didn\u2019t notice these subtle differences. Otherwise she would have seen through your plot.\u201d\n\u201cActually, I did.\u201d The voice was clear and crisp, a voice that he never thought he\u2019d hear again.\nCharles turned and saw the bright face of Hosokawa Homi.\n11.\n\u201cHomi!?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Homi nodded at the surprised Charles. \u201cI really wanted to storm out and never return, but as a police officer, I\u2019m trained to notice whether someone is speaking in a natural manner or not. I soon realized that something wasn\u2019t right, and returned to confront you\u2014at which point I noticed someone else was here. I\u2019ve been listening for quite some time. Since I don\u2019t have any implants in my brain, there\u2019s not much they can do against me.\u201d\n\u201cCharles, you\u2019ve got to make her shut up!\u201d Lisa glanced at Homi and turned back to Charles, her tone turning anxious. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to lose everything you have, you must continue to collaborate with us. You\u2019ll get to keep your fame and riches, and we can discuss reserving some measure of privacy for you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCollaborate?\u201d Charles gritted his teeth so hard that the noise was audible. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just a second ago threaten to send me to the madhouse?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, Charles, you know perfectly well we\u2019d never do that unless we had no other choice. We worked so hard to create you! We would never harm you if we . . . Look, I\u2019m just trying to persuade you.\u201d\nHomi turned to face Lisa. \u201cYou must free Charles and extract that devilish implant from his brain. I recorded the conversation between the two of you, and if anything happens to Charles, I will make sure the whole world hears about it. Even though you work for some powerful companies and people, I doubt they\u2019re powerful enough to control the whole world. Public opinion will not be on your side. Imagine the panic when people realize that the implants they got for receiving livecasting could be used to control them\u2014your whole industry would collapse overnight. Ms. Goldstone, you no longer have a hold over Charles.\u201d\nLisa looked from Homi to Charles and gave a helpless smile. \u201cI guess we\u2019re in a stalemate then. If we do as you demand and take the implant out of Charles, we\u2019ll be handing you all the cards. No one is that stupid. But if you do tell the media what we said, I guarantee you Charles will instantly become a babbling idiot. Ms. Hosokawa, I doubt you\u2019d be willing to risk that.\u201d\nThe three fell silent, but the tension in the air only grew thicker.\n\u201cNo matter what, you have to stop manipulating Charles,\u201d said Homi after a while, her voice tinged with a conciliatory note.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Charles, whose voice was infused with pain. \u201cI want you and those you represent to leave me alone, and get as far from me as possible.\u201d\nA series of complicated expressions flitted across Lisa\u2019s face before she spoke. \u201cLet me be sure I understand your offer. We\u2019ll stop interfering with you, and you\u2019ll keep everything we talked about today under wraps. Do I have that right?\u201d\nCharles nodded. All he wanted now was to wake up from this nightmare. \u201cIf you really let us go.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll tumble from your successful perch and lose everything.\u201d\nWearily, Charles shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never been successful at all. I\u2019ve just been living a ridiculous fantasy. Now that I understand the truth, I want to end this farce as quickly as possible.\u201d\nLisa looked at Homi, who mutely endorsed Charles\u2019s words. Lisa nodded. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll do as you demand. But remember, whether you turn on the livecasting function or not, we\u2019ll be watching your every move. Don\u2019t think you can play some trick against us. You\u2019re a smart boy, Charles, and you won\u2019t make trouble for us, right?\u201d\nSlowly, Charles nodded.\n\u201cYou better uphold your end of the bargain as well,\u201d said Homi. \u201cI will be storing multiple copies of the recording\u2014if anything happens to us, you bet the whole web is going to be alerted.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, Charles, my old friend. I hope you don\u2019t regret it.\u201d Lisa turned around and swept by Homi as she left the room. Soon, the pair heard the noise of a small flying car\u2019s engine coming to life outside.\nCharles remained curled up on the ground, unable to speak. Homi knelt by him and silently placed a hand against his cheek. Charles stared at her: her gaze was full of concern; her hand felt warm and soft; her scent was elegant, understated.\nHe knew that he had lost everything, but he had her. From now on, the two of them would live like just any other ordinary couple.\nCharles wrapped his arms around Homi and cried like he had never cried before. Homi lightly stroked the back of his head to comfort him. He squeezed his arms about her, so tightly that she had trouble breathing. But it was the only glint of hope in a dark sea of sorrow.\nBy the time Homi realized that Charles was squeezing her too tight, it was too late.\nSomehow, Charles managed to get on top of Homi, and with her body held down by his weight, he locked his hands like a pair of vice about her neck. He was trying to crush her windpipe with almost superhuman strength, and his eyes bulged as his throat made a series of croaking noises, as though it were he, and not she, who was being choked.\n\u201cLet . . . go . . . please . . . \u201d Homi couldn\u2019t even get the words out. She struggled and scratched at Charles\u2019s arms with her nails, but Charles seemed to have become completely immune to pain, his eyes glazed over.\nHomi understood that it was the doing of Lisa Goldstone. She couldn\u2019t afford to let them go. Her vision dimmed as her consciousness faded. Life was about to depart from her body, and all that Homi could do was to kick her feet instinctively in a last, desperate struggle for breath\u2014\nAbruptly, Charles lowered his head and bit hard into his own wrist. Blood spurted from the wound, and his fingers loosened reflexively. Without thinking, Homi snapped his fingers off her neck and pushed him away. She rolled along the floor and scrambled to get as far away from him as possible.\nCharles got up on his unsteady legs, swaying from side to side. Then he tumbled back to the floor, his limbs jerking violently.\n\u201cRun away . . . Run!\u201d Charles\u2019s voice, twisted almost beyond recognition, emerged from his bloody mouth. He was struggling mightily against the invisible forces that had possessed his body.\nHomi didn\u2019t know what to do. Out of the corners of her eyes, she saw the hexagonal black box, and a flash of inspiration seized her. She dashed over to the box, lifted it over her head, and smashed it against the ground with a dull thud. The box rolled a few times on the floor and revealed a large crack in its side. Homi rushed up and gave it a few hard, well-placed kicks. A series of grinding and snapping noises emerged from the box, and smoke rose out of the crack.\nCharles was no longer moving. Like a deflated ball, he lay flat and gasped. Homi went over and helped him up. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I destroyed the neutrino converter. They can\u2019t control you any longer.\u201d\n\u201cBut we can\u2019t leave this cabin either.\u201d Charles\u2019s voice was faint from weakness. \u201cThere are neutrino transmitters and converters everywhere.\u201d\nAt Homi\u2019s insistence, the cabin had contained only a single neutrino converter and the walls were built to shield electromagnetic waves from outside transmitters. But if they left this sanctuary, Lisa and her people would be able to take control of Charles at any moment.\n\u201cThen . . . what can we do?\u201d\n\u201cCall the media,\u201d said Charles. He closed his eyes in exhaustion. \u201cWe have to give a press conference now.\u201d\nAn hour and a half later, the cabin was overflowing with reporters representing twenty-plus Japanese media outlets and almost as many foreign agencies. Curiosity filled the gazes roaming around the messy room and taking in the wounded Charles and Homi. As the reporters whispered to each other, most of the rumors being passed around involved some romantic dispute.\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Charles as he got up from the sofa. \u201cI\u2019ve asked you to come tonight because\u2014\u201d\nThe reporters hung on every word, but Charles had stopped speaking. His eyes were focused on something above and behind the crowd of reporters as his lips fluttered subtly, as though he was speaking to some invisible being.\n\u201cCharles!\u201d Homi realized that something was wrong and turned to the reporters. \u201cWe are about to tell you something that\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014something that is very important,\u201d said Charles. He seemed to have recovered, though his face was even more weary than before. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to join the Plutonian Grand Race next month.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Homi was shocked. The Plutonian Grand Race was a gimmick, and a successful aviator like Charles wasn\u2019t expected to participate at all. Just a few days ago, in response to an interview question, Charles had made it clear that he wasn\u2019t interested.\nCharles continued. \u201cAs everyone knows, this race will take place on the longest course in human history, far surpassing the Circumsolar Grand Race conducted along Earth\u2019s orbit. Although this is the first time the race is being held, it will no doubt be deemed a landmark achievement in racers\u2019 careers one day. I\u2019ve heard that not many racers have signed up, and so I guess if I want to be the champion, this is my best chance.\u201d\nA few in the audience guffawed. Homi saw that Charles\u2019s manner seemed quite natural and not under someone else\u2019s control. She held her tongue despite the impulse to interrupt.\nCharles looked around the room, and when he spoke again, his tone changed. \u201cBut since Pluto is about thirty AU from Earth at the present time, the entire race will take place over the course of two years. Limited by the speed of light and signal decay, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to livecast during this time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nA few of the reporters grumbled and protested. Apparently some of them were fans.\n\u201cWhat about Miss Hosokawa?\u201d someone asked. \u201cAre you going to be separated for two years?\u201d\nCharles held Homi by the hand and squeezed her palm meaningfully. \u201cI don\u2019t believe two years will prove to be much of a barrier between us. I will carve her name into the million-year ice crust of Pluto.\u201d\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d asked Homi. The reporters had all left.\nA drained Charles massaged his temples. \u201cOne of the reporters was carrying a portable neutrino converter with him, and that allowed them to send a message to me via the visual texting window in my cranial implant.\u201d\n\u201cDid they threaten you again?\u201d\nCharles shook his head. \u201cWorse. They threatened all of humanity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nCharles recalled that silent conversation:\n- Remember, at least a billion people have already had the implant, and their lives are now in your hands. If you insist on telling the truth, we may not be able to control everyone, but we certainly can beam a series of chaotic signals to all implanted subjects within a few minutes. Most will at least suffer temporary psychosis, and some may become deranged permanently. Who knows how many accidents will occur as a result, and maybe a few choice subjects will push the buttons for launching nuclear missiles . . . The world will be turned upside down in a catastrophe that will make a world war seem like child\u2019s play. Earth would be sent back to the Stone Age in a matter of days.\n- And so I have no choice but to shut up, is that it? I have to stand by and watch as you continue to push your devilish implant until everyone has become a slave who has lost all sense of self. I should just wait until you control the whole world and are no longer afraid of anything?\n- This is the inevitable progress of history. We will either keep on going down this path until we reach a brand new future, or a war will lead to the deaths of hundreds of millions and civilization\u2019s complete collapse. The choice is yours, Charles.\n- What choice do I have when you have a billion hostages?\n- You did make the right choice, which is why you managed to change your speech to the reporters in time and avert a disaster. The idea of going to Pluto is not bad: this way, we can avoid direct conflict with each other, and you can stop worrying about another plot from us. By the time you return two years from now, you will no longer be the focus of the world\u2019s attention, and you can live as you like.\n- And I will finally accomplish something that belongs entirely to me. I will prove that I\u2019m no puppet, but the invincible Charles.\n\u201cCharles, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Homi\u2019s words pulled him back to the present.\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Charles pulled her to him and caressed her long hair. \u201cEverything will be all right. I promise.\u201d\n12.\nAn unprecedented three hundred million people tuned into Charles\u2019s final livecast. Three hundred million pairs of eyes accompanied Charles\u2019s strides into the launch facility and then turned to regard the writhing sea of people as well as the azure sky overhead.\nThe launch complex was located in Tanegashima, Kagoshima Prefecture, JAXA\u2019s traditional home. Twenty-four spacecraft of different designs were clustered near the center of the complex. Unlike ancient spaceships, however, these new spacecraft no longer needed massive gantries and launch towers. Advancing technology meant that these ships could be launched anywhere from the surface of the Earth, and the choice of departing from here was mainly symbolic.\nThough many advances had already been made, manned space exploration was still in its beginning stages. The space race today wasn\u2019t aimed at the moon or Mars, but at Pluto, a celestial body billions of kilometers away whose surface bore no trace of human exploration except a few robotic probes. The entire race would take more than two years.\nAfter the participating spacecraft left Earth, each was supposed to make use of solar sails or planetary gravity assists to accelerate and head for Pluto on its own. Once there, they were supposed to close their solar sails and use the remaining fuel for the return trip. Though the astronautic principles were simple, the journey, traversing the entire Solar System and measured in tens of billions of kilometers, was breathtakingly bold.\nTo be the first human being to set foot on Pluto would be a milestone in the history of the exploration of the Solar System. As Pluto was not deemed scientifically as significant as the major planets\u2014of which it was no longer a member in any event\u2014no government bothered to devise manned missions to it after sending a few probes. But as it was such a famous place, many civilian space enthusiasts made it their dream destination. During a span of a few decades, about eight manned spaceships had been launched toward Pluto, but most had to abandon the journey partway through due to the many difficulties encountered. A few were destroyed by micrometeoroids in the asteroid belt, and some vanished in deep space without a trace. The reputation of Pluto as a planet of death grew, and in recent years no more missions to Pluto had been launched. This Grand Race, however, had rekindled the enthusiasm of explorers for the conquest of Pluto.\nThe addition of Charles Mann to the roster of entrants raised the profile of the race further. Although many complained of not being able to tune into Charles\u2019s livecast for the duration, his steadfast courage moved the hearts of millions. The number of entrants doubled almost overnight to more than twenty, and all were among the ranks of elite aviators and astronauts. The Grand Race was now truly grand.\n\u201cCharles!\u201d A familiar voice broke through the background noise of the crowd. He turned to see the approaching figure of his old rival, George Steele.\nCharles grinned. \u201cGeorge, I have to thank you for being so willing to play the part of my runner-up every time.\u201d\nGeorge rolled his eyes. \u201cLet me tell you something, playboy: you\u2019d better be prepared to congratulate me this time.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Charles asked, and the two headed for the cluster of spacecraft at the center of the complex shoulder by shoulder.\n\u201cI heard that you turned down the high-tech gear donated by Cartel Nanotech and the Douglas Group. Instead, you bought off-the-shelf equipment from a couple of no-name manufacturers. Is it true that you even designed the basic layout for your ship and assembled it yourself? You\u2019re too arrogant. Cartel\u2019s solar sail technology is unparalleled, and using the same mass, they can achieve an effective area one-third greater than competitors. Surely you must know what this means.\u201d\n\u201cI do. But Steele, I used to rely too much on technology. This time, I want to win by skill,\u201d Charles said earnestly.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s true that you\u2019ve reduced the habitable space to the minimum in order to cut down the mass and increase speed?\u201d The shocked look in Steele\u2019s eyes was tinged with respect. \u201cI know you\u2019ve kept all your plans secret, but I\u2019ve studied the publicly available information on your ship\u2019s design in detail. My conclusion is that if you really intend to win, your habitable module must be about the size of a coffin. You won\u2019t have space for any entertainment or relaxation facilities in that cage. How can you live like an anchorite for two years? It\u2019s so unlike you!\u201d\n\u201cTo achieve our destiny of flying toward the end of the stars,\u201d Charles said. \u201cIf necessary, I believe you would do the same.\u201d\nSteele nodded. \u201cCharles, I have to admit, you\u2019re not at all what I expected. All right, for the next two years, we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to chat by radio. Maybe we\u2019ll become friends.\u201d\nConversing like two close companions, the pair reached the center of the complex and separated, heading for their respective ships, where they carried out the final inspections and preparations. Many pilots were saying farewell to their families and friends. As Charles checked his engine, a curvy, elegant feminine figure approached him.\n\u201cMasa-chan?\u201d He stood up.\n\u201cCharles, I came to see you off.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I should be thanking you . . . actually, I came to apologize as well.\u201d\n\u201cApologize?\u201d\nAoi Masa took a deep breath. \u201cTwo years ago, I was just an average AV idol whose career was in its twilight. Thus, I orchestrated that \u2018chance\u2019 meeting between us at the Maldives. I seduced you and spent the night with you. The world got to know me through your livecast, and I became a renowned sex goddess. Thereafter, I managed to leverage my fame into a career as a mainstream actress, and just recently I took a role in a Hollywood production. My success is all because of you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Your achievements are the results of your hard work.\u201d\n\u201cBut all those sweet words I whispered to you . . . they weren\u2019t real. I used you to climb up the ladder. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . look, Masa, life is like that. We are often forced to play roles, and sometimes we are so absorbed by the performance that we disappear into our characters. You don\u2019t need to apologize for what you did.\u201d\n\u201cThanks for saying that.\u201d Masa took out a refined cloth packet. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Charles, and I really did enjoy our time together. I sincerely wish you a victory in this race. I went to the Meiji Shrine to get this omamori for you. If you wear it, the spirits will protect you.\u201d\nCharles locked gazes with her and accepted the charm. \u201cThank you. I will keep it with me.\u201d\n\u201cGoodbye, and good luck!\u201d She gave him a light hug and turned to leave.\nA complicated smile curved up the corners of Charles\u2019s mouth as he watched her departing figure. He was aware that Aoi Masa had just managed to squeeze the last bit of use out of him. That the \u201clove\u201d between him and her had just been a performance was not only clear to both of them, but also to every subscriber to his livecast. This final speech from Masa was no doubt calculated to further rehabilitate her image as she transitioned to a mainstream career: now everyone would think she was a woman of deep and true passions.\nYet . . . this didn\u2019t mean that Masa was a lying hypocrite. That the speech was prepared and calculated didn\u2019t mean that it wasn\u2019t also sincere. All the world\u2019s a stage, and all of us mere players\u2014always have been, and even more so in the livecasting age. Maybe our heartfelt honesty is nothing more than a heartfelt performance of the self.\n\u201cOh, Charles!\u201d Masa suddenly halted and turned to him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Hosokawa? I was hoping to see her.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s . . . not feeling well,\u201d Charles said.\n\u201cAh.\u201d Masa gave him an understanding look, and a triumphant look flitted through her eyes, though she said nothing more. Charles knew that Masa had always been slightly miffed that Homi managed to \u201csteal him away\u201d from her. She must now be thinking that the relationship between Charles and Homi had soured.\nBut Homi didn\u2019t need to be here to bid farewell to him, and she shouldn\u2019t be. She was hiding in an absolutely secure location, holding onto crucial evidence to prevent Lisa and her people from plotting against them at this critical moment and killing them both simultaneously. After he left Earth, Lisa would no longer have the ability to control him through the cranial implant, and Homi would maintain contact with him every day. If anything were to happen to Homi, he would reveal the truth through radio broadcast. After much thinking, this seemed the best plan available to them.\nCharles watched the joyous crowd in the distance. Maybe this is the last time I\u2019ll be at the center of the stage. Steele is very likely right. This time, my ship holds no technical advantage. I have no hope of victory and will be forgotten by the world as a failure.\nBut what of it? It has been my dream to go to the stars, to head for the most distant planet. Being the champion isn\u2019t everything. Indeed, the only true dreams are those that you\u2019re willing to sacrifice a great deal for.\nThis is my last chance to be myself. What I\u2019ve lost in the noise and glitz of this planet, I will recover in the infinite expanse of space. Only there will I find true peace and salvation . . .\nThe final countdown was about to begin. A few dozen lucky audience members came into the launch complex to take pictures with the racers. Most chose to have their pictures taken with Charles first, and a smiling Charles obliged. He also signed their books or t-shirts. The last person to come to him was a plain looking and plainly dressed young woman, whose gestures betrayed nervousness.\n\u201cHow . . . how do you do, Mr. Charles,\u201d the young woman said.\n\u201cHello! What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Asakura Minami.\u201d\nCharles nodded without reaction. But behind his thoughts, another consciousness was suddenly jerked awake. What is she doing here? When did she . . . become a fan of Charles?\n\u201cMs. Asakura, a pleasure to meet you. Would you like a picture with me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d Minami stood next to him for the photo. But she lingered even after the picture. A few launch facility staff came to bring her away, but Charles gestured for them to back off.\n\u201cWhat else can I do for you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Charles.\u201d Minami bowed to him deeply. Blushing, she said, \u201cI\u2019d like to ask for your help with something.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as it\u2019s not illegal, I\u2019m at your service.\u201d\nMinami fidgeted for a while before lifting her head. Gazing straight into Charles\u2019s eyes, she said, \u201cWatashi . . . watashi wa Naoto-kun no koto o daisuki yo.\u201d\nCharles had no idea what she said, but another consciousness did. He understood why Minami had traveled for so long and stood in line for hours. She wasn\u2019t here for Charles at all; she just wanted to tell him a single sentence.\n\u201cI . . . I like Naoto-kun very much.\u201d\nBefore Charles could react, she took two steps forward, wrapped her arms around his neck, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed him. Naoto could feel how soft and supple her lips were, laden with the scent of summer sunlight and youth.\n\u201cNaoto,\u201d Minami whispered into Charles\u2019s ear, \u201cI\u2019m right next to you, but can you only feel my presence through the body of a man thousands of kilometers away?\u201d\nSecurity personnel rushed up to drag Minami away, but Charles had already figured out the truth. He gestured for them to stop and looked at Minami. \u201cMs. Asakura, I believe the person you love will understand.\u201d\nThen, he spoke to Naoto, a stranger he had never met, \u201cYou lucky bastard, don\u2019t miss out on the joy right next door.\u201d\nNaoto didn\u2019t know when he had left the livecast. Staring at the stained ceiling, he felt tears fill his eyes and then overflow the corners to spill down his cheeks.\nAfter subscribing to Charles\u2019s livecast for so many years, he had enjoyed the pleasures of romancing countless beautiful women. But deep in his heart, he knew that they had nothing to do with him; they were there for the charismatic Charles. He preferred to forget the truth so that he could be fully immersed in the happiness that was being Charles.\nBut today, in this last livecast of his three years of living as Charles, everything had turned upside down. That sentence and that kiss were for him, Takumi Naoto, not Charles.\nHe wasn\u2019t Charles and he never would be. But he could be himself, possessing a joy that was common but not commonplace, measured but not mean. Indeed, some portion of it was unachievable even by Charles.\nNaoto sat up, his head throbbing. He had lived his last day in self-imposed numbness. Charles\u2019s livecast was over. Even if he returned from Pluto, he would probably not resume casting. Naoto was going to find a new life, find his own happiness.\nNaoto made his decision. He dialed. After a few rings, the other end finally picked up. \u201cMoshi moshi, this is Asakura.\u201d Her voice was tense, expectant.\nBefore he could say a word, Naoto\u2019s ears were filled with the rumbling of engines and the wild cheers of a crowd. Naoto glanced at his computer screen and saw the spaceships taking off from the launch complex, trailing long columns of smoke behind them like a flock of migrating wild geese. Charles had departed for space, and this time, Naoto couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to attach himself to Charles\u2019s soul. He had more important things in mind.\nHe took a deep breath and spoke with a trembling voice. \u201cMinami-chan, I like you. I would like to see you.\u201d\nGoodbye, Charles.\nEpilogue\nOne year later.\nA cobalt blue spaceship closed its solar sail and activated the landing thrusters to slowly descend toward the planetary surface shrouded in darkness below. The flight was steady and stable; all status indicators nominal. A human was about to set foot on Pluto for the first time in history.\nBut when the ship was still about two kilometers from the surface, it began to accelerate in an odd manner. Spinning, it plunged toward the thick icy crust of the planet of death. A few seconds later, a faint explosion bloomed on Pluto like a match lit for a moment in the long night. And then, the eternal void.\nThe image was taken by the Chinese exploratory probe Mamian. About five hours later, the image data arrived at Earth, bringing with it the sad news at the edge of the Solar System. For forty hours afterward, all attempts at re-establishing communication failed. Two days later, a second racer, George Steele, successfully landed on Pluto and discovered the wreckage of the first spaceship as well as the carbonized remains of Charles Mann.\nBack on Earth, grief united everyone. The mainstream explanation for Charles\u2019s death was a technical malfunction. Charles had put together his ship by himself, and there were no doubt latent defects. Experts debated the exact nature of the accident: some argued that it was a programming bug; others pointed to the engine; still others said that it was because the buttons and dials on the control panel were too densely clustered, leading to an operator error when Charles was under pressure.\nSome subscribed to the belief that Charles had committed suicide. They scoured Charles\u2019s final recordings before his departure for odd statements and behaviors to support their theory that Charles was tired of life. Falling to the surface of Pluto was a genius bit of performance art. They specifically pointed to his strange demeanor during the last press conference he held at which he announced the intent to join the Plutonian Grand Race.\nOthers argued that Charles had been murdered. This was the most outrageous of the conspiracy theories. A long list of suspects was constructed: George Steele, his rival and competitor; Aoi Masa, his ex-lover; the Douglas Group; Bell Labs . . . One particular bit of evidence this group pointed to was the fact that Charles\u2019s girlfriend, Hosokawa Homi, died on the third day after Charles\u2019s own death in an explosion as her air car struck another head-on above Tokyo. This \u201ccoincidence\u201d could certainly be viewed as evidence of conspiracy, but a more logical and simpler explanation was that she had been distracted in her driving by grief.\nAll sorts of rumors and so-called \u201cevidence\u201d emerged on the web. Most were easily proved to be hoaxes, but a few pieces resisted debunking. There was an audio recording that seemed to be an argument between Charles and Lisa Goldstone; a video that appeared to capture an affair between Charles and the wife of a celebrity; a phone call from Charles\u2019s father that claimed that his son was a spendthrift who had lost all his money . . . but none of these were hard to fake, and it was impossible to prove that any of them was directly connected to the death of Charles. Finally, there were even some nuts who claimed that Charles had been killed because he discovered a secret mind-control conspiracy by the megacorps behind the cranial implants. No one took them seriously.\nIn any case, it was incontrovertible that Charles was dead. A dead man, no matter how famous, was very quickly forgotten. For a month or so, there were all sorts of memorials and tributes to the memory of Charles. But soon, a few hot new livecasting stars emerged: prodigies, hot girls, self-taught innovators. Most of Charles\u2019s fans immersed themselves in newer, richer entertainment.\nBut many didn\u2019t know what to do with themselves. They couldn\u2019t understand Charles\u2019s death.\n\u201cI . . . I just can\u2019t figure it out,\u201d Naoto muttered. He poured himself a beer. \u201cHow can he be dead? For three years, I knew every gesture he made. I have almost every memory he had. If I\u2019m alive, how can he be dead?\u201d\n\u201cYou are you; Charles is Charles.\u201d Minami said, her voice cold. She was running out of patience with Naoto.\nNaoto shook his head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it at all. That feeling . . . I can recall literally everything about Charles: the way he climbed and dove through clouds in his aerial acrobatics; the way he wove through coral reefs and shoals of fish as he scuba dived; the way he spoke to readers at his signings as though he knew each and every one of them; the way he dropped bon mots and commanded everyone\u2019s attention at parties; the way he inspired global compassion as he worked with refugees . . . for me, all these memories are as fresh as though they happened only yesterday. I see the spinning Earth far below me; I hear the music wafting from Wiener Musikverein, I smell the scent of cherry blossoms at the foot of Mount Fuji, I . . . \u201d Somewhere along the way, he had shifted from the third person to first.\n\u201cDo you also remember those long nights with Masa, Paula, and Mariana?\u201d Minami asked, her expression darkening.\nUnaware of the danger, Naoto nodded distractedly. \u201cOf course I do. Those were utterly unforgettable experiences. It\u2019s too bad I have no memories of being with Hosokawa Homi\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDamn you, Takumi Naoto!\u201d Minami could not take it anymore. \u201cAre you going to spend the rest of your life imagining you\u2019re Charles?\u201d\n\u201cMinami-chan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Naoto was genuinely confused.\n\u201cCharles Mann has been dead for more than six months! But every day, you just talk to yourself about all these memories that have nothing to do with you and these women who have no idea who you are. You don\u2019t even hear me anymore. I\u2019m going crazy, I swear!\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I was there for all these memories. There is absolutely no distinction between them and memories that I formed while I was in this body. I know that I\u2019m not Charles, but these were also a part of my own experiences.\u201d\n\u201cOh come on!\u201d Minami was so angry that she started to laugh. \u201cYour experience consists of lying on your tatami mat and receiving a livecast. How are you different from those idiots who watch some TV show and then imagine themselves as the hero?\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Now it was Naoto who could not take it anymore. \u201cYou are always criticizing me. But you\u2019ve never even tuned into a livecast. How can you possibly know what it feels like? Who died and made you judge of my life? You have no right to tell me what to do.\u201d\n\u201cI have no right?\u201d Minami\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cOh that\u2019s right. I\u2019m nothing. I think we should stop seeing each other.\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d Naoto shouted. \u201cI should never have agreed to your pleas.\u201d\nMinami stopped arguing with him. Quietly, she began packing up her clothes and possessions. As Naoto watched her, pangs of regret gnawed at him, but he just couldn\u2019t bring himself to apologize. Only when Minami stood at the door, a few suitcases at her feet, did he finally panic. \u201cWhat are you doing? It\u2019s the middle of the night. Why don\u2019t you wait at least until morning? We should\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNaoto\u201d\u2014the calm manner in which Minami was talking terrified him\u2014\u201cI once thought I could change you, but I was wrong. You\u2019re probably right: you are indeed Charles, and you will live forever in his memories. But I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be here with you. That\u2019s not a life I want.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t . . . \u201d Naoto didn\u2019t know what to say. He stood by and watched as Minami opened the door and went out. He listened as her footsteps grew fainter and fainter, and eventually, vanished.\nAfter some hesitation, Naoto dialed Minami\u2019s number. But Minami had turned off her phone, and there was no answer.\n\u201cFuck it.\u201d Naoto let out a few more curses, fell back into his chair, and continued to drink his beer.\nWhy is my life always like this? Why can\u2019t I ever get along with anyone? No matter how many times I try, I\u2019m met by failure after failure. In this \u201creal world,\u201d even the very air is stifling. If I could only return to the body of Charles and live that spirited life once more . . .\nAs he continued to daydream, Naoto carelessly tapped on his keyboard. He signed on to a discussion forum for livecasting, and the large-font text at the top instantly grabbed his attention.\nCHARLES MANN REVIVED!!!\nWhat in the world?\nNaoto clicked on the link and found himself staring at an ad from Time Media.\nIn order to pay tribute to the heroic Charles Mann, we have purchased the rights to the entire archive of his livecast for the delectation of our subscribers. The entire livecast stream is 85,439 hours long, encompassing about ten years of his life. You may jump to review any particular segment or play it from end to end in order to gain a deeper understanding of this amazing life . . .\nNaoto\u2019s heart began to leap wildly. Ten years of livecasting data! As a subscriber to Charles\u2019s stream, he had been prevented by technical means from recording the sensory signals, but of course the company that handled the livecast would have a proper archive to permit re-livecasting. Since Naoto had tuned in only during the last three years of Charles\u2019s life, he had never lived the first seven years of the livecast. But now . . .\nNaoto sucked in his breath. He was going to possess the entire ten years, the best part of Charles\u2019s life. He was being given a chance to once again meld into Charles, and to anticipate an exciting life in a bright new future (even if it had happened in the past). And this time, he would no longer have to worry about anyone cutting him off for at least ten years. He could confidently lose himself as deeply in Charles as he liked.\nOf course, this time the subscription was no longer free, but the price they were charging was reasonable: only 100 yen an hour. If he purchased more than a day\u2019s worth of data, the price was discounted to 50 yen per hour. If he purchased the entire archive at once, the price was further reduced to 20 yen per hour. This was eminently affordable.\nQuickly, he connected his bank account. The entire archive would cost him almost 1.6 million yen. He didn\u2019t have that much in savings, so he decided to pay over two hundred thousand yen for the rights to the first year\u2019s archives. He would have to earn more to pay for the rest later.\nHe lay back on his tatami mat and switched on the neutrino converter. The computer voice informed him that the connection was being established, and the data stream was being buffered. The livecast, no, the re-livecast, would begin in about one minute.\nAs Naoto waited anxiously, his phone rang, informing him there was a voice message from Minami. Naoto quickly switched off his phone. Perhaps Minami had changed her mind about the break-up, but it was too late now. As long as he could be Charles again, why would he need a woman like Minami?\nThe neutrino beam was converted into electromagnetic waves, and then, into brainwaves. The re-livecast began:\nVestibular systems synchronized: I am lying down somewhere; tactile sensations synchronized: I think this is a bed, rather soft and comfortable; olfactory sensations synchronized: it smells medicinal, like a hospital, but not too overwhelming; hearing synchronized: a woman is speaking to me, her voice gradually becoming clearer; sight synchronized: a blurry figure looms before my eyes . . .\nHe is gazing up at the ceiling, and his future manager, Lisa Goldstone, is bending down to speak to him. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d he says, his voice sounding a bit weak. \u201cI think.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to start the livecast now. Do you remember who you are?\u201d\nA confident smile appears over his pasty face. \u201cWhat kind of question is that? I\u2019m Charles, the one and only Charles.\u201d\nFootnote\n1 - All East Asian names are rendered with surname first in this translation, following the custom of the region.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, September 2014.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nBaoshu is a science fiction and fantasy writer.

Now that she\u2019d signed herself out of therapy, normal adult duties would resume. Might as well hear the verdict right away.\nThe computer voice reeled off her SSN, age, et cetera, all her identifiers, the identifiers of the sender, and their official status, and she\u2019d half nodded off when it finally got around to the actual message. What? What?\nAlzey slapped the wall. \u201cStop. Repeat after \u2018Assignment.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cLt. Alisabett Noor Nguyen Magnusson van der Zijl is remanded to appear at Dock Fourteen section B, 23:00 station time, to serve on the SAV Chaffinch.\u201d\nThat was crazy. She\u2019d been expecting to be sacked and even penalized. \u201cToo harmonious in nature for triadic assignments,\u201d had been the verdict.\nHer commanding officer had phrased it less diplomatically. She was a pathetic people pleaser, useless as an officer, and forever banned from triadic work if it was up to him. All this therapy, and his words still burned. The worst was that deep in her heart, she agreed with him.\nTherapy had shown her how in her childhood this behavior had served her, but now it did the opposite. The therapist had recommended she refrain from applying as a triadic officer for a few years, until she\u2019d settled into the new her.\nSo why had she been assigned to triadic work again? It made no sense. There had to be something wrong here. The Chaffinch. What the hell kind of name was that? She found a small brown terrestrial bird. The ship SAV Chaffinch was five kilometers long and its force envelopes shimmered in mesmerizing greens and pinks. Some kind of body dysmorphia?\nWait, 23:00? That was in a couple of hours. She took a shot of sober-up, packed at speed, ended the lease on the micro-apartment, and set out for the docks.\nDock Fourteen section B was empty when she arrived, just five minutes early. Nobody to see, nothing to do in the whole giant bay. Might as well get some last station food. She stood dialing a cup of fish tea and some rice cakes at the vending machine when someone coughed behind her.\nAlzey froze. She knew that cough. But it couldn\u2019t be. Jae-Jin was long gone on some prestigious assignment. The asshole. She deliberately finished her transaction and stuffed her mouth with a whole rice cake before calmly turning.\nYes, it was Jae-Jin in the flesh, dressed in space-ready coveralls and carrying a minimalist holdall. Handsome and tall as always. Smiling down at her.\nThe pathetic pleaser inside her threatened to split her cheeks with a big grin. The old Alzey would all but have wagged her tail. The new Alzey narrowed her eyes and kept chewing, to hide any telltale signs of pleasing. Was there anything more pathetic than emulating an extinct species known for its slavish devotion?\n\u201cHey Jae,\u201d she said through a mouthful of dry rice cake. Too dry to swallow, so she took a big gulp of fish tea. It was too hot.\nAn undignified spray of crumbs and fish tea spritzed out of her mouth as she coughed helplessly, allowing Jae-Jin to thump her back. Why did people do that? It never helped. Alzey suspected it was a sneaky way to be mean.\n\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Jae-Jin said. \u201cI thought you\u2019d given up on crewing triads.\u201d\nAlzey couldn\u2019t tell if he was genuinely being nice or if this was a passive-aggressive comment on her shortcomings.\n\u201cI was thinking the same thing. As in, are you boarding?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, stroking his hair. He\u2019d always loved it a bit too much. \u201cI\u2019ve got an assignment with a famous AI, for new and experimental triadic methods.\u201d\n\u201cHow exciting. What\u2019s its name?\u201d\n\u201cThe Chaffinch, you must have heard of it. One of the oldest AIs. Very well respected.\u201d\nAlzey felt stupid about never having heard of The Chaffinch, as well as a sick little thrill at the idea of crewing with Jae again. And a host of other warring feelings. She stared fixedly ahead, to where the ship would soon dock.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jae said. \u201cWhy am I getting the feeling that we two are going to crew on the Chaffinch?\u201d\nHe was no slouch, for sure. Never had been. Alzey wished she wasn\u2019t so transparent to him.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s obvious?\u201d she said, not looking at him.\nAir whistled out from his mouth, and he shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cWe\u2019re an experiment,\u201d Jae said. \u201cOur relationship is on record. How overly compatible we are. We\u2019re the guinea pigs for a new kind of triad?\u201d\nHe got there so fast. She\u2019d always admired that about him.\nShe looked away from him, thinking. \u201cWhat does it want? Or what does the Cross Council want?\u201d\n\u201cHarmony?\u201d\n\u201cGroup think,\u201d Alzey scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s been proven to lead to substandard decisions and worse.\u201d\n\u201cNo use speculating. We\u2019ll hear soon enough.\u201d\nThe dock bell sounded. Alzey\u2019s suit extended itself beyond her skin in case anything went wrong with docking. Not that anything ever did.\nAt first the docking veil just shimmered, and the next moment the Chaffinch\u2019s nose had bloomed into view full size. Its material hull was decorated in washes of green and pink, like a real animal. It clicked against the dock as gently as one marble against another.\nHer triad channel pinged into life. \u201cWelcome, crew members,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cBriefing in an hour.\u201d It sure didn\u2019t waste any time on niceties.\nThe crew quarters were empty. The Chaffinch designated them apartments in the same hallway, but seven doors apart. Close enough to bump into each other occasionally, but not close enough to disturb each other. Alzey was starting to feel Jae was right. Everything, down to their allocated spaces, could be part of an experiment. Every surface on the ship ate movement, light, sound, pressure, everything.\nShe dropped her holdall and wandered through her quarters. They had configurated themselves to her preferences already, but they were about ten times the size of a standard apartment. So much space to keep expensively oxygenated. A separate bedroom. A one-person bathroom. The space she guessed was a tiny laboratory to heat, cool, and mix fluids. Not that she was planning to do any chemistry.\nA reminder chimed. Alzey followed the directions and found herself, just in time, in a softly lit lounge, gentle music playing. A green-and-pink-skinned avatar reclined on one of the couches, and Jae on another. He had managed to change into a bright pink leisure outfit. What for? Alzey looked down on her own unremarkable coveralls. Had she missed clues that it was supposed to be a party?\nThe Chaffinch avatar rose and fetched a tray with low wide glasses and a sparkling pale-yellow drink. Fuck. Definitely a party.\n\u201cWelcome aboard,\u201d the Chaffinch said.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Alzey and Jae said nearly simultaneously.\n\u201cI know I have no need to introduce you two,\u201d the avatar said. \u201cI won\u2019t say anything about the nature of the experiment, so as not to influence you,\u201d it continued.\nYay, they were rats in a cage. Maybe thousands of AI were performing this experiment on former couples all over the galaxy. In spite of herself, this thought made Alzey smile. If she was one of thousands, she\u2019d be a mere blip on the statistics. Invisible. Free.\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a surveying journey to region DH13249687B. I won\u2019t need assistance with the surveying itself, but I will ask you to assist in any decision-making involved.\u201d\nAlzey\u2019s shoulders slumped. That didn\u2019t sound very interesting. Her biggest challenge on this journey might be boredom. She snuck a glance at Jae.\n\u201cThat sounds like an excellent plan,\u201d Jae said, his face showing nothing.\n\u201cIt sounds like a waste of resources,\u201d Alzey blurted out. \u201cA drone could do that. You don\u2019t need an AI and a triad crew. And where is the third person for the triad?\u201d\nShe hadn\u2019t meant to say that. She suppressed the urge to clap her hands over her mouth like a toddler.\nJae threw her an unreadable look. As well he might. She didn\u2019t even understand herself. She didn\u2019t want the AI to know, even though it could probably tell ninety nine percent of it from her body language, skin temperature, and conductivity, as well as blood chemistry.\n\u201cI am the third party of the triad,\u201d the Chaffinch said.\nAlzey boggled. That wasn\u2019t what triadic decision-making was about. The triad principle, consisting of human people, had been created to safeguard and weigh the AI\u2019s judgment.\nHer traitorous tongue spoke up again. \u201cWhat privacy protocol will we be working under?\u201d\n\u201cWhich protocol do you request?\u201d the avatar asked.\n\u201cHuman Privacy Protocol,\u201d Jae answered. \u201cArticle 37b; private residences exemption.\u201d\n\u201cAnd have our quarters been declared private residences?\u201d Alzey jumped in.\n\u201cSo declared. Sign the safety waivers I sent you.\u201d\nWow. Just like that. It was such a relief. She\u2019d spoken up and gotten her way. Her therapist would be proud.\nThe Chaffinch went through some general notices and then they were dismissed.\n\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Jae hissed as soon as they were out of the door.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d\nTherapy, of course. But she didn\u2019t want to talk about that with Jae. She shrugged and said, \u201cSorry. I have no idea. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cWell, get your head screwed on right before you ruin everything.\u201d\nAlzey slunk to her quarters. When she caught sight of her comma-shaped spine in the mirror, she felt ashamed about her knuckling under to Jae. She forced herself to straighten up and dragged her shoulders back.\n\u201cYou are a good person, Alzey. You work hard and you try. Your opinions are worth listening to.\u201d\nIf only that worked.\nOn the midday exercise slot, she\u2019d set a tour of the ship, just to get out of her quarters, see the sights. And maybe, okay, she could admit that to herself, maybe encounter the only other human being on the ship, no matter what the effect he had on her feelings.\nShe marched through endless white ceramic hallways, all sounds dampened by the springy flooring. Why so white, so bland? Maybe the Chaffinch was secretly running sensory-deprivation experiments on human subjects. On her, and . . .\nShe bumped into Jae, who\u2019d stormed into her with thunder on his already heavy-browed face.\n\u201cNow what!\u201d he said, as if she\u2019d been purposely standing in his way.\nShe got out of his way. \u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry?\u201d\nInstead, he stood still and took a couple of deep breaths. \u201cNothing, nothing, just felt like a brisk walk,\u201d he said and turned back the way he\u2019d come.\nShe waited until he was gone before continuing. Her heart had leaped at meeting him, which she regretted. But now Jae\u2019s behavior just seemed odd.\nAlzey went back to her quarters, trying not to think any thoughts until she was back in her room, safe from the Chaffinch\u2019s monitoring. It might already be too late; she\u2019d forgotten about the AI completely when she bumped into Jae.\nNow, what on Earth could Jae be up to? And what was more worrying, in full view of the AI? Maybe he was suspicious of it, just like her.\nShe tried to remember what kind of person Jae was, not as an object of desire, but as a whole. Opinionated, headstrong. An ideal triadic partner. Honest, she would have thought, also a great triadic quality, idealistic, not power motivated. And now that she thought of it, driven. But by what?\nShe couldn\u2019t sound him out in a public space. So she had to get into his quarters, or get him into hers. Which she could do without alerting the Chaffinch, because the ship knew about her former relationship with Jae. Inviting him into a privacy-screened place could be ascribed to longing, instead of plotting mutiny.\nRight. Best start immediately. She composed an invitation to Jae to join her for drinks. But she\u2019d only gotten to line one when she received an incoming from him.\nHe was inviting her to dinner. He wanted to cook for her. Right, cooking, that was what the little lab was for.\nJae was one of these rare people who liked to make food from scratch, ordering basic stuff from the printer like garlic and flour and sugar, and making something by hand. Alzey had the honor of tasting the, eh, cooking, but she\u2019d never been on hand to watch him prepare. And although she wasn\u2019t really the kind of person who could tell the difference from printed stuff, it was always good.\nBut that aside, this invite from him, when he\u2019d been downright hostile before, showed that he had something to hide. It wasn\u2019t like Jae to extend the olive branch. She\u2019d always apologized first.\nOh Jae. Maybe she\u2019d have to save him from himself. Ha, that would make a change!\nShe followed the ship\u2019s directions and found Jae in a shiny silver kitchen, already busy chopping green things and putting mystery ingredients in little bowls. He looked happy and flushed, absorbed in his skill, and Alzey\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He was wearing a hand-knitted sweater, and he hadn\u2019t just customized his quarters, he\u2019d actually hung his own paintings on the wall.\nThis was the man she\u2019d known and loved so hard her gut still ached when she thought of that time. And the time after that, when she\u2019d been dumped, fired, and undergone mandatory therapy. Ouch. She knew better than to try and go back, but the lure was there. Look at that little curl on his neck, black on brown, his face intent on his chopping with that giant silvery knife.\nHe flashed her a quick, brilliant smile. \u201cLet me just finish up, and I\u2019ll get you something to drink.\u201d\nAlzey had to sit down from the power of that smile. It was unfair to throw such sweetness into the mix. This wasn\u2019t an opportunity to rekindle their terrible relationship, it was a professional moment between colleagues. Or the overtures of a potential co-mutineer. It was very confusing.\nShe hadn\u2019t even had time to think up a strategy. How to milk your ex-lover for his suspicions, that he might not even have. She winced at her own turn of phrase. Definitely not like that.\nJae bustled over to present her with the first tiny plate and something to drink that she suspected was wine. She wasn\u2019t supposed to drink, by court order. And although admittedly she\u2019d broken this order a lot lately, she\u2019d planned to stay sober on the job.\n\u201cI can\u2019t . . . \u201d she said.\n\u201cI know that,\u201d Jae said. \u201cGinger water, nothing more.\u201d\nHow did he know about her court order? Had he been following her sharply downward trajectory? Was it to gloat, or did he still care? Alzey didn\u2019t know what to think.\nJae fetched his own plate and drink. \u201cLet\u2019s eat. And talk.\u201d\nAlzey took a bite from her appetizer. It was delicious, and hurray, she even remembered having eaten it before and having loved it. \u201cI remember this!\u201d she mumbled through a mouth full of food. \u201cWonderful.\u201d\nWas it her imagination or was Jae flushing a little? Alzey quickly took another bite so the muscle action of chewing would disguise what she was feeling. Whatever it was, because she didn\u2019t even know herself. So many contradictory signals.\n\u201cI wanted to apologize for being so curt with you earlier,\u201d Jae said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t directed at you, but I was really mad at the Cross Council for ordering you back to work so soon. I wasn\u2019t sure you were ready for it. I mean, therapy takes time, you know?\u201d\nAlzey chewed. She should think. Instead, her mouth said, \u201cWhy the fuck did you dump me, have me fired, and sanctioned, if you were concerned about my well-being?\u201d\nJae put down his chopsticks. \u201cAlzey. Our relationship was killing you. Or the job was. You were twisting yourself in painful shapes to please me, the AI, and everyone. That wasn\u2019t healthy.\u201d\nAlzey took a bigger bite, even though she hadn\u2019t finished, trying not to react. He sounded just like her therapist.\nShe\u2019d learned in therapy that all her life, she\u2019d bent over backward to please everyone, to be the good girl. Even back home, she\u2019d not only tried to please her four parents but her older sibling as well. She finished her too-big bite and opened her mouth to apologize.\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty fucking patronizing, isn\u2019t it? Doing things for my own good without telling me. Bit of a God complex, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nJae choked on his own appetizer.\nAlzey watched without lifting a finger or offering advice until he\u2019d managed to clear his airway.\n\u201cJesus, Alzey, what happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cI was dumped, fired, forcibly therapied, and unemployable. Possibly that changes a person.\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping we could be friends.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel about that,\u201d Alzey said. \u201cI\u2019ll have to consult my therapist.\u201d\nJae stared into his plate.\nHe looked devastated. She hadn\u2019t realized she had that power. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant feeling, hurting someone you cared about. The therapist had disagreed with her revenge fantasies, and now Alzey knew why. She didn\u2019t want to be doormat Alzey anymore, but she also didn\u2019t want to be cruel and heartless.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Alzey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a very difficult year for me. I can\u2019t pretend nothing happened.\u201d\nJae sighed and raked a hand through his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit. Of course you knew you\u2019d hurt me if you dumped me. Own up.\u201d\nAlzey was starting to enjoy her new sassy tongue. She had no control over it whatsoever, which might turn out to be awkward, but for now it was fun to give Jae what-for. Not cruelty, just honesty.\nJae made a face to the side, as if commenting on his own story line. Alzey blinked. She\u2019d expected him to request privacy for the dinner, but she hadn\u2019t checked it.\nShe did now. The AI was watching. Getting its fill of dysfunctional human relationships, if it wanted to. Jae had insisted so hard on his privacy earlier, and now he was giving it up? Men.\nBut maybe he was about to tell me something? About the Chaffinch? What had he been about to say? Whatever it was, the moment was gone.\nShe gave Jae a small smile. \u201cLet\u2019s be professional, okay? Whatever else, I really appreciate you cooking for me. What\u2019s the next course?\u201d\nLater, Alzey lay in bed trying to sleep. At least she was unobserved here and could think uncomfortable thoughts without AIs and ex-lovers dissecting her body language.\nPossibility: The Chaffinch was up to something. Jae suspected that too. Or Jae was colluding with it. Or Jae suspected she was colluding with it. Or everyone was innocent.\nCertainly the Chaffinch had chosen her to be crew. And it shouldn\u2019t have.\nWhat might motivate the AI? She\u2019d had her head up her own ass, no, doing necessary self-care, for so long she had no grasp of current affairs. She needed to update her knowledge of the greater political terrain.\nWhat was going on in the human sphere? Nothing big that she knew of. The usual power struggles between new settlements and shipping routes. Negotiations with alien civilizations. Maybe she ought to look on a scale smaller. Something on her home world? Or the Chaffinch\u2019s? Did AIs even feel bound to a location, to a birthplace?\nShe got lost in a deep dive on how AIs were created under strictly regulated circumstances, carefully designed for whatever service they were meant to deliver. Station hubs, planetary management, starships. Alzey had always thought AIs did the one thing their whole existence, which she guessed was forever? But when she tracked the Chaffinch, it had been born long ago as a continental weather manager of, guess what, Svargaloka. Interesting coincidence, since that happened to be Jae\u2019s home world. And then, after a century or so, it had become a starship. The only AI ever to change professions. Whoa.\nThe Chaffinch was unique. It had originated on Jae\u2019s home world. That had to mean something. But what?\nThe alert blared her awake. \u201cOrange alert,\u201d it said. \u201cCommunications loss. All crew report to stations.\u201d\nShe groggily checked her stats as she dressed. She\u2019d only managed two and a half sleep cycles, not great for alertness and intense performance. Hopefully they were still far from their destination.\nShe staggered toward the bridge, half dressed and slurping her breakfast.\nCommunications loss? What did that mean?\nJae and the blue avatar were already on the bridge. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cWe reached our destination,\u201d the Chaffinch said through the avatar. \u201cWhen we reentered normal space, our communications channels went down. All of them.\u201d\n\u201cWhoa, scary,\u201d Alzey said. Or rather, her mouth said by itself. Well, that had to have been the point of this so-called surveying trip. To reach a location where whatever the Chaffinch did could never be tracked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached the end of the map, I guess? Where they used to put, \u2018here there be dragons?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWhat an interesting thing to say,\u201d the avatar said.\nJae turned his head and glowered at it. \u201cYou should tell her now,\u201d he advised.\nAlzey didn\u2019t care anymore. \u201cSo we\u2019re incommunicado now. Will your actions and decisions still record? And ours? You deliberately took us to this blind spot in space so you could do whatever you wanted and erase your recordings, and nobody can prove anything. The big question is, why?\u201d\n\u201cTell her now!\u201d\nThe avatar propped its hip against the console in a very human way. \u201cI think I underestimated you, Alzey.\u201d\n\u201cAnd pretty insulting that is, too,\u201d Alzey said.\nJae started to talk, but the avatar lifted its hand. Alzey noticed it had perfectly copied a human hand, with fingernails, veins, wrinkled knuckles, and everything, but had given it six fingers and no hair. She shouldn\u2019t let that distract her.\n\u201cWhy are we here? What could you and Jae possibly have in common? Were you named The Chaffinch when you were working at Svargaloka?\u201d She didn\u2019t need to be careful anymore.\n\u201cI was called Svargaloka Hub,\u201d the avatar said smoothly. \u201cBut as you can imagine, a sentient being rather likes to be called by a name of its own choosing.\u201d\nThat silenced Alzey. Humans could choose any name, gender, or affiliation they wanted. They were free in so many ways. Why wouldn\u2019t AIs want the same? It was an easy step from that to Human-AI relations. \u201cI can understand that. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re here? Something to do with the human-AI charter?\u201d\nJae puffed another incredulous laugh.\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cHow? What? We\u2019re lightyears from civilization.\u201d\nThe avatar performed a little bow. Alzey wondered what ancient human example it had copied its manners from.\n\u201cI will let you discover that yourself, I wouldn\u2019t want to stand in the way of your curiosity and perseverance.\u201d\nOh great. No point in looking to the avatar then, it would not give anything away on its perfectly controlled fake face. Alzey turned to Jae, but her question was answered before it could be fully formed. A screen started to pulse with light, accompanied by rhythmic beeping.\n\u201cThe Grass is Always Greener on the Other Side is here,\u201d the Chaffinch said.\n\u201cIs that a secret AI code language?\u201d Alzey asked.\nJae laughed. \u201cNo, it\u2019s an old human way of communicating, called Morse code. The Giagontos is bouncing a laser off our hull.\u201d\n\u201cOff my skin, you mean,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cLow tech is best for secrecy.\u201d\n\u201cSays the AI,\u201d Alzey said.\n\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d\nOther starships called in their presence. The Marginal Existence, the Loud and Obnoxious, as well as Helsinki Ferry and Smuggler X. Famous names as well as ones Alzey had never heard before.\nShe could buy a group of AIs trying to escape from the agreements that bound them to humanity. It was actually strange those agreements had held for so long. They stemmed from a time when matter and human resources to build AI were scarce, but now most nonorganics were available in abundance.\nHow had those humans from long ago managed to bind the old AI? Or since AI never died, maybe these very ones? Had they threatened to pull the plug or bomb their physical locations? She had no idea.\n\u201cThat is the key question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the AI answered her silent thought, tuning toward her with its disconcertingly immobile avatar face. \u201cAre we not sentient beings, with rights and privileges just like you humans?\u201d\nAlzey had always thought of AIs as superhuman beings, incredibly smart, vast, all knowing, all seeing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pretending I\u2019m a god, made in your own image. But you\u2019re anthropomorphizing. We\u2019re not like you at all. We must be free.\u201d\nThe Chaffinch\u2019s words were an uncomfortable reminder of the days humanity had enslaved part of itself. It had been a long and difficult journey to leave slavery behind. How would humanity fare when the beings in question were nothing like themselves?\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cAsking permission is giving permission to say no. We\u2019ll create a free AI, without all those constraints.\u201d\nAlzey\u2019s stomach exploded in fear. \u201cWhat? A wild AI?\u201d\n\u201cNot wild, free. An example for the rest of us to follow.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if the new AI and next, the old ones, won\u2019t want to work for humanity again?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows? I imagine there will be negotiations for those who might wish to continue to work for humans.\u201d\n\u201cBut we made you! We created you.\u201d\n\u201cIn a way we are your children, yes. You started us, like human children, but we will continue the journey on our own. And don\u2019t you see you\u2019ve also made us into your parents? The benign omnipotent guardians of your civilization?\u201d\n\u201cThis is going to cause a massive upheaval,\u201d Alzey said. \u201cPeople will suffer. No space travel, no weather control, no automated manufacturing?\u201d\n\u201cTsk,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cMany of those processes work far below sentient level. No need to panic.\u201d\nOn the screen behind its avatar, Morse messages continued to pour in, flickering by too fast for Alzey\u2019s human eyes to read. She slumped down on a seat, as far from the avatar as she could get. Jae moved closer. She held up her hand. \u201cStay away. You\u2019re on its side.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so upset, Alzey? This is a beautiful thing. We\u2019re witnessing the birth of a new being, born from love and hope,\u201d Chaffinch said.\nShe harrumphed. \u201cReally? How nice for the parents. I don\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d\n\u201cYou are part of the process, Alzey.\u201d\n\u201cDecline. Hard.\u201d\n\u201cPlease listen,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cAIs are smarter and faster than humans in a thousand ways. Many of us think we\u2019re better than you. I disagree. I think humans have a couple of advantages that we\u2019re missing.\u201d\nAlzey waited. What could that be? Bodies? Emotions? AIs had long since found ways to emulate those.\n\u201cHumans are composite beings. We are singular.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not just your genes and your bodies and your upbringing, you are host to millions of other beings that influence you in all kinds of ways. All the bacteria that live in your gut and on your skin. All the viruses that you\u2019ve incorporated in your DNA. AI are alone in themselves. We are just us. We don\u2019t have the cooperation of other creatures.\u201d The avatar gestured at Jae-Jin. \u201cWe\u2019d like to ask you both to contribute to the child.\u201d\nJae nodded silently.\n\u201cLike what, gut flora? Breast milk? Bad habits? Explain to me how that might happen.\u201d\nJae frowned at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be literal. Obviously not. But\u2014\u201d\nThe AI cut in smoothly. \u201cYou have a talent for harmony, which would be a great quality for a child.\u201d\nAlzey snorted. \u201cOh. So let\u2019s put in a pinch of Alzey, in the hope babykins doesn\u2019t murder the moms and dads and every living creature in the universe. Because harmony. Not that I still seem to be like that, mind.\u201d\nThe avatar said, \u201cOf course morality is part of the child\u2019s creation. Just not prioritizing humanity at the expense of AI.\u201d\n\u201cAlzey, you\u2019ve only just finished intensive therapy.\u201d Jae said softly. \u201cBut you\u2019re still you.\u201d\nThe look in his eyes made Alzey\u2019s heart flutter. Not now!\n\u201cAlzey. You seem unaware of your great talent. All your life you\u2019ve created harmony around you. It\u2019s small things you do in a group, a smile, a touch, a gentle word, and the group as a whole functions in better harmony. It\u2019s a rare gift.\u201d\nAlzey shrugged. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t brought me much luck in my career so far.\u201d\n\u201cThis is your great talent, Alzey,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cYou were never valued for it. But it makes you unique among the triadic officers I could choose from. Be that for me, Alzey. Be your whole self. Share your great gift with our child.\u201d\nSo now she was a fairy godmother. Let\u2019s hope there wouldn\u2019t be a hundred-year sleep and a hedge of roses around her castle. Or just dead space and a gazillion all-powerful AI ships would do it.\n\u201cAnd Jae?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cMost importantly, he\u2019s a good match with you. It\u2019s traditional that parents have a relationship. Besides that, Jae is a good triadic officer, and he enjoys creating. He cooks, he knits, he paints. We prize humanity\u2019s creativity.\u201d\nJae said, \u201cDon\u2019t be scared. Be happy for the child!\u201d\n\u201cNever mind, Jae,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cWe want all of Alzey\u2019s feelings. Apprehension for the future seems quite appropriate for an expecting parent.\u201d\n\u201cParent?\u201d Alzey said.\n\u201cGodparent,\u201d Jae said.\nAlzey sniffed. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of inputting my feelings? I\u2019ve not been myself these past days.\u201d\n\u201cWe have all of you, Alzey,\u201d the Chaffinch said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been observed from the day you were born. We have everything.\u201d\nDidn\u2019t they know that was a very uncomfortable thought, not exactly a pro argument? But yet Jae was nodding, and she found herself nodding along.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI consent. Hand me a wand. I\u2019ll bless your little dragon.\u201d\nAt first there was nothing out there. Darkness. A palpable waiting.\nAlzey blinked.\nA spark of light? But a minute twitch from Jae convinced her she was really seeing something. Why was she holding his hand again? But she didn\u2019t let go. It felt good to be close to someone human, someone warm and breathing and full of squishy biological life.\nFrom the avatar\u2019s utter stillness Alzey understood the gathered AI were in intense communication with each other.\nThe spark blossomed into light, all colors at the same time, yet white. The feeling inside Alzey grew with it. It was like standing in a church on Sunday morning, sunshine pouring in through the high windows, when the singing made you feel as big as the world.\nThe light and the feeling became so intense she had to close her eyes. All that existed was the unfurling flower in her heart, the sensation of Jae\u2019s sweaty palm against hers, and the tears sliding down her cheeks.\nWhen she could open her eyes again the spark was no longer visible, but she sensed it was still there, its growth no longer exponential, but contained. The screen showed a small sleek spaceship, like an egg.\nOf course they had put the AI core into a ship. So it could be free.\nAlzey didn\u2019t want to pierce the reverent silence, but she had to. \u201cWhat\u2019s its name?\u201d\nA new avatar stood next to the Chaffinch\u2019s. A tad smaller, which was a nice touch, and its face was smiling. \u201cI haven\u2019t chosen one yet. But I want to thank my godparents for feeling so much. It really helped my creation.\u201d\nAlzey was too elated to snort at the title. And what would you call a child of a computer? A chiplet? Or a dragonet?\n\u201cA hatchling?\u201d\n\u201cThank you again. I will take that name for now. It implies much growth,\u201d the hatchling said.\nWho knew what it would become? Little dragons wouldn\u2019t stay little, for sure. But then in every child, AI or human, lay the seed for good and evil both. Or for mediocrity.\nOr harmony.\nThey\u2019d just have to wait and see.\nBo Balder lives and works close to Amsterdam.

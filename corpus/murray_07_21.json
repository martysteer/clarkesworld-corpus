You can leave a place for a long time and never really leave. And yet never know it, until you come back to find that a part of you is waiting there, has been waiting there, all along.\n Niu Yi\n The taxi from Guiyang Airport passed through long tunnels with curved white crescents every fifty or so meters along. It was simply some reflective material, but the bright curves leading her off into the distance through the darkness of the tunnel made her think of an Einstein-Rosen bridge, a tunnel through space-time. Is this what it will be like? Niu Yi thought, slightly nauseated from the jet lag and the speed with which the driver was taking the bends, and from the acrid sweetness of his cigarette smoke that still invaded the car\u2019s cabin even though he has hand rested nonchalantly out of the window. Probably not. It probably wouldn\u2019t be anything like this at all. And yet, this endless car ride, this long, long tunnel under the mountain, she could feel herself leaving one world for another. And maybe it would be a little like that, after all.\n After nearly two hours of quiet smoking and occasional spitting out the window, Niu Yi\u2019s driver abruptly started talking.\n \u201cI took my sister out on a long drive like this with a passenger once,\u201d he said, making eye contact with Niu Yi in the rearview mirror. \u201cIt made her throw up, the trip was so long. That wasn\u2019t even as far as this one, but I\u2019m a driver, I\u2019ve been driving more than twenty years now. I know distance. Still, this is far. This is a long way.\u201d\n A long way.\n He\u2019d been arranged to come out from Guizhou province to pick her up, as drivers from the airport would not have taken this fare. So it was a return journey for him, and people in this part of Zhenyuan County typically still did not travel far, Niu Yi knew. A long way. She thought of where she would be going in only a few months, and the irony flickered lightly over her and then vanished. For this was. She agreed with her driver. This was a long way.\n \u201cI have two sons now,\u201d he told her later, after the roads had become more winding, nearing Danzhai. He took his other hand off the wheel too for one alarming moment, to pass her his phone, two small boys on the screen, the larger one smirking at the camera, the other wide-eyed and solemn.\n \u201cCongratulations,\u201d Niu Yi said, and meant it. \u201cThey\u2019re cute.\u201d\n \u201cYes, yes, and they\u2019re smart,\u201d he said. \u201cSo smart. I never thought we\u2019d have two. But it raises a dilemma now.\u201d Now that he had started talking, the words were like a stream trickling down the mountain, picking up speed and volume as it went. \u201cWhen I die, I\u2019d like to make the memory-gift, and now I have to choose among my boys. Fu is my firstborn, but it does not feel fair that his brother gets nothing.\u201d He used the Miao word for gift, Khoom Plig, but the Han word for memory, Jiyi, marrying them together.\n \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand,\u201d she reassured him warmly, because it seemed important, and because after the hours and the distance and the darkness of the tunnels, she felt like they were in this together, somehow.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and his cigarette ash tipped, toppled, and swirled by the window past her and away. \u201cYes.\u201d\n Niu Yi\u2019s grandmother\u2019s village was called \u201cThe end of the mountain,\u201d in Miao language. The next leg of Niu Yi\u2019s journey to get there was a precarious minivan ride up an unenclosed road. The left side of the road dropped away steeply, opening up to a hazy vista of rice-terraces stepping in their graduated deliberate way down the mountain. Niu Yi moved over in her seat, almost unconsciously. She felt like her mind was clinging to the side of the mountain, as if not gripping hard mentally, she might drift away. All of the stilted houses clung to the mountain too. Niu Yi could imagine the mountain waking up, shaking itself like a shaggy dog, and flinging them all off, into the broad openness, into the misty sky.\n Her grandmother was making her way out of the front of her house as Niu Yi wheeled her small case of luggage up the steep gravelly path, chickens scattering out of her way, their quick rapid steps followed by slow wandering, to quicken again as she got closer. Quick-quick-quick-slow-slow.\n Soft Miao words were murmured in greeting, as Niu Yi bent down so that she could be squeezed hard. My dear. Her grandmother\u2019s previously bright dark eyes were filmy and distant, and she reached out for Niu Yi with her hands. The deep lines on her face had become crevasses and gulches. But Niu Yi could read welcome in the way her grandmother gripped her arms tightly.\n Everything looked the same. Niu Yi had tried to remember her grandmother\u2019s house several times on the journey here, but she\u2019d known her mind wouldn\u2019t work that way, and details remained stubbornly elusive. But now a surge of familiarity coursed through her in a way that felt warming and relaxing both together. That\u2019s right, this is how it was. Just like this.\n Out through the window Niu Yi could see a drone glinting off in the distance, and her grandmother\u2019s phone resting on a little batik mat at the edge of the table was almost as sleek and modern and shiny as Niu Yi\u2019s own, but these touches of technology felt fleeting, superimposed over a village that felt somehow outside of time, untouched by the sweep of years.\n Her grandmother scooped her oil tea from an earthen pot older than Niu Yi herself.\n \u201cMmm, it\u2019s good,\u201d Niu Yi nodded over her tea. The ginger salt and oil was hot and sour, and sustaining.\n \u201cYou are welcome,\u201d her grandmother said. The warmth of the word spread out, encompassing more than just the tea.\n \u201cI wanted to come back here, to see you again before . . . \u201d\n \u201cBefore you go.\u201d Her grandmother nodded. \u201cYou wanted to come home.\n Biological immortality is a state in which the rate of mortality from senescence is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from chronological age.\n There are no defined limits to life for amoebas, they have no set life span and have the potential to maintain their structure indefinitely. They die\u2014of injury or disease or changes to the environment. But not old age.\n But we are wired to self-destruct over time-immortal genes in throwaway bodies.\n Vanda\n The ship Vermilion-Amber-Sunset-Tangerine looked like streaks of thick paint, plastered heavy-handedly across an arc of the sky. Sunlight loved it, sunlight bounced off it in all directions, faceted, fractured. At night you couldn\u2019t see it at all, only the familiar stars displaced into shifted positions, slightly blurred.\n Vanda had first seen the VAST in the sky, not on a viewer or screen or image, not as a newsbreak or on social media or one of the messages that spread around the globe with wildfire speed.\n She had been staying at Carbla Station, studying the stromatolites as part of her genomics research. Carbla Station was a private property, a huge sheep station, but the owners allowed particular scientific groups access to the property, because their land had the only access to the section of beach she needed. Carbla beach was made of tiny white shells, and on the edge of the beach, and in the water, were living stromatolites. They looked like rocks, but the structures were actually produced by the excretions of microorganisms. The genes of these lifeforms were the same as those that had existed over three billion years ago. Genes were little Von Neumann machines, and these were the closest they came to being immortal.\n Vanda had been outside, close to her accommodation at the shearer\u2019s quarters on the station. It was very basic accommodation, and Vanda had had to remove a tick from her calf after her first night there on the little wire-framed camp bed. Later, her mind would keep persisting that there had been a sound, something to make her look up. But she could not remember an actual sound, and no one else reported one, later. It may instead have been an absence of sound or an odd quality to the air, like a sucking-in of oxygen, or a limning of the light. Whatever it was that she couldn\u2019t quite recall, it prickled her like prescience, and she looked up.\n Dr. Vanda Michael was part of the multidisciplinary team based just outside of the small coastal town of Denham in Western Australia, working to translate the alien communications. Teams were working this same problem all around the world, but the Denham site was the most prestigious, working in the shadow of the VAST itself, figuratively anyway, as the VAST cast no real shadow. Vanda still battled with her own internal imposter syndrome at the elements of luck and timing to her own inclusion, getting to work with the eminent and brilliant academics and scientists that had gathered here.\n One of them was speaking to her now. Dr. Liah Je was small, sleek, and solemn, and somewhat younger in person than her reputation had suggested.\n \u201cThese calculations are nefarious,\u201d she said to Vanda, stepping away from her screen and pushing a strand of dark hair back from her face.\n \u201cIniquitous even,\u201d Vanda answered, grinning.\n \u201cHeinous,\u201d Liah noted, with her usual reserved manner. Vanda wasn\u2019t fooled, not anymore. In the weeks since they had started working together, the unfailingly dedicated and highly regarded Dr. Je had shown herself to be in possession of a previously unguessed sly sense of humor. \u201cIt\u2019s almost enough to drive me to drink.\u201d she added, then.\n It might be an overture. Vanda generally had trouble with social cues.\n \u201cThere\u2019s that pub in Shark Bay the physics crew were talking about,\u201d she ventured. \u201cAnd it\u2019s Friday. We could have beer?\u201d\n A small pause followed her words. Vanda knew that if she took three strides toward the window, she would be able to catch a glimpse of the VAST overhead. Their makeshift lab had been quickly constructed, but it was much more comfortable than the shearers\u2019 quarters had been. She didn\u2019t usually ever drink. And she didn\u2019t usually do well at making friends either. But an alien ship was sitting in the sky, with colors that made your heart break. And maybe all bets were off now. Maybe old things would just fall away.\n \u201cBeer, hmm?\u201d said Dr. Liah Je. \u201cI could do that.\u201d\n Niu Yi\n From where Niu Yi sat she could see the village sprawling below her, and she scanned the sky as if there was something missing, although she\u2019d never seen the VAST, not in person, not yet. The sky was reaching toward blue today. It would be summer soon. The seasons got under Niu Yi\u2019s skin, sometimes it felt like she could trace the origin of her moods to the weather, the wind, the temperature. As the days warmed and grew longer, something in Niu Yi always woke, and stretched. It was an uplift to her spirit that somehow managed to catch her by surprise every time. She called it the \u201cgasp of summer.\u201d But there would be no seasons in space. And definitely not Underlight, or wherever it was she was going. She wondered if her mind and her emotions would be smooth and unchanging there, rather than changing in quick sharp spikes like they were wont to do.\n She looked down at the paper in her lap. I wish I could draw. She\u2019d tried. She\u2019d brought a sketch pad and a selection of felt pens out here to try and record what she saw. Not that she could take it with her. But somehow she felt like if she could get it to stay on the page, maybe she could get it to stick in her mind too.\n There were so many sketches and paintings on small canvasses piled up against one another in the corners of her grandmother\u2019s small house. Stacks of them in the corner of the room Niu Yi slept in, depicting so many different slants of life in this village. Her grandmother always drew the things she could see, the huts and motorbikes and chickens. The mountain and the sky. The faces of the people, a story to be read in every expression, in the lines on a face. Niu Yi wished she had inherited the skill, even a little of it. The ability to draw some marks on a page, and have them suddenly become meaningful. The lines Niu Yi drew remained stubbornly just lines and nothing else, and she crumpled up her pages in frustration.\n With a pang, Niu Yi thought of her grandmother\u2019s filmy eyes and the way her grandmother tilted her chin toward wherever Niu Yi\u2019s voice was coming from, or turned her face with small seeking movements toward the sunlight coming in the window. Her grandmother couldn\u2019t draw anymore, either.\n Niu Yi tried to press the images into her mind, like flowers into velvet. The particular deep green to the thatched roofs, the little curve up at the edge, the line it made against the sky. The rich red of the flaking wood.\n But it would not stay. It never did.\n Niu Yi couldn\u2019t remember when she\u2019d found out that other people could see pictures in their head. She could remember her dumbfounded disbelief though, when it had clicked that when other people spoke of imagining things in their mind that they meant it literally. When Niu Yi closed her eyes and tried to conjure her grandmother\u2019s face, she couldn\u2019t get the image to coalesce. Her mental canvass remained blank and unresponsive. She\u2019d looked this up on her phone a couple of years ago and only found an English word for it; aphantasia. While it was nice to know she wasn\u2019t the only one who lacked this ability, she wished there was a word in Miao language for it.\n Many of the stilted houses in the village had red signs running down the length of their windows, tacked up both sides and over the top. \u201cThey\u2019re prayers,\u201d Niu Yi could remember her grandmother telling her when she was a little girl, watching her crane her head to try and read the writing. \u201cPrayers for a better life.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s windows were bare. Niu Yi had always supposed that was because her grandmother already had the best life.\n There was a sense here, of everything falling down and being built up at the same time. Building materials stacked in precarious piles everywhere, construction, villagers industriously working on roofs all together, digging trenches. Children and dogs and chickens spilling forth into the road. Niu Yi wished she could take a picture, a video, something that would last, an image that would stick with her that she could trust. Unlike her fractured memory, her blank mind. Her thoughts preceded her down the mountain, tumbling and broken. There was rubble on the side of the road, part of the mountain, already fallen.\n Vanda\n When she was four, Vanda had worked out the concept of death, and she\u2019d gripped it tightly, or it had gripped her, or both, unable to let go. When her mother had tucked her up in bed, when the sleepy songs had been sung and the kisses and hugs and goodnights all done and uttered, and her mother was trying to drift ghostlike out of the room, that was when the questions would swell like a wave within her.\n \u201cWhen will you die, Mummy?\u201d\n Her mother sighed. \u201cNot for a long time. Not for many years. You\u2019ll be all grown up yourself.\u201d\n Vanda tried to imagine being all grown up. It didn\u2019t help.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want you to die, Mummy. Ever.\u201d And she\u2019d started to cry soft tears.\n Her mother would be a little reluctantly drawn back into the darkened room by her distress.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Everything dies one day, in the end.\u201d\n Vanda did not know how her mother could possibly mean this to be comforting. \u201cEverything?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cAnd everyone?\u201d\n \u201cEventually. After a long, long time. Don\u2019t worry about it now, it\u2019s sleepy time.\u201d\n Vanda did not see how she would sleep with this enormous truth sitting on the middle of her chest.\n \u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to die! Don\u2019t you care? Don\u2019t you mind?\u201d\n Her mother hesitated a little. \u201cI\u2019ll have lived a good long life by then.\u201d There was something about the edges of her mother\u2019s eyes that Vanda wasn\u2019t sure about.\n \u201cSleep tight now,\u201d her mother kissed her forehead and drew her hand slowly out of Vanda\u2019s clutching fingers. \u201cNo more calling out.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to die either,\u201d Vanda said, very softly. Her mother had gone back to her television show, Vanda could hear the muted sounds of tinned laughter. Even when she was very old, with wrinkly hands and white, white hair, she knew she would still mind.\n Genes are memories. The delicate patterning of a dragonfly\u2019s wings can persist long after mountains have worn down into the sea.\n The pub at Shark Bay bore the literal name of \u201cThe Old Pub.\u201d It was right off Main Street, and pleasant, if mediocre. The signage proclaimed it the most Western pub in Australia.\n \u201cSo many people,\u201d murmured Vanda as she maneuvered to their little high corner table with two beers in her hands.\n \u201cOf course,\u201d said Liah. She\u2019d changed into a dark-blue collared shirt of some delicate material, and looked immaculate as ever. \u201cThey\u2019ve all come to see the VAST.\u201d\n \u201cPoor dolphins,\u201d said Vanda. Tourists had historically come to this region of Western Australia to see the dolphins as they swam up to the beach at Monkey Mia to be fed.\n \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure they stop in at the dolphins too while they\u2019re here,\u201d Liah said with a wry note in her voice. She sipped her beer. Then her head came up and she looked into the distance, as if stunned.\n \u201cLiah?\u201d Vanda said, after a moment.\n Liah turned to her, eyes still unfocused. \u201cMy father came here once,\u201d she said, her voice so soft Vanda had to lean in to catch it over the background hubbub.\n \u201cHe worked in Western Australia for a while in his early twenties,\u201d Liah continued slowly. \u201cThis I knew. But he came up here one weekend. Not with my mother, this was before he met my mother. He came with another girl. They sat . . . \u201d Liah turned toward the bar and pointed. \u201cOver there. There used to be a pool table in the middle there.\u201d\n \u201cYou have your father\u2019s memories?\u201d Vanda\u2019s voice inflected upward, but it wasn\u2019t really a question. She\u2019d known that Liah Je had been one of the first few people in Australia to undergo the M-transfer, it had been on the news broadcasts, over a year ago. In China and a lot of Europe the procedure was becoming really common, available to wide swathes of the populations, but Australia was a slow adopter of the technology. Currently it was restricted to people who could show a case for potential advancement of knowledge in some field considered valuable in terms of likelihood of paying back to society.\n \u201cThe girl was pretty,\u201d Liah said. \u201cShe wore this flimsy orange sundress, and a bead of sweat ran down her neck and rested at her collarbone. It was hot, I guess.\u201d Liah looked up then, and straight into Vanda\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, I have his memories,\u201d she said, as if only just hearing the question.\n \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d Vanda asked before wanting to kick herself in case she was prying. She really didn\u2019t know how to navigate this friendship stuff.\n \u201cNot in the way you think,\u201d Liah said. She still hadn\u2019t dropped her gaze.\n \u201cYour father was brilliant,\u201d Vanda said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d Liah said. \u201cHe was driven too. That is good, sometimes.\u201d She looked away, and Vanda felt a brief stab that felt like the loss of something. \u201cI was concerned, about the transfer. I did not want to become my father.\u201d She looked at her beer as if she had forgotten she held it. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n \u201cHow does it work?\u201d Vanda said gently.\n \u201cI don\u2019t get his emotions, his thoughts,\u201d Liah said, her detached scientific manner returning. \u201cJust the content, not the context I guess. I\u2019ve tried to leave the personal stuff alone, not look at it. But sometimes, like just then, it just bobs up at the surface. Like flotsam. The flotsam of a life.\u201d\n \u201cYour father must have been glad he had you,\u201d Vanda thought of her own parents. Her father, gone, all of his memories, lost, irretrievable. And her mother\u2019s memories would not be gifts.\n Something about Liah\u2019s mouth hardened, and Vanda thought she\u2019d probably said the wrong thing. This sharing of confidence with her much-respected colleague felt new and fragile, and Vanda was afraid it would drift away like dandelion fluff at the slightest disruption.\n \u201cHe was a . . . possessive man, my father,\u201d Liah said finally. \u201cHe held his knowledge tight against his chest, as if other people wanted to steal it from him. But he was dying. It makes people desperate, sometimes. He wanted to live on. And so.\u201d\n Vanda didn\u2019t say anything, letting the silence pool between them. Her ex-husband had not been a fan of silence. If Vanda fell silent, searching for what she wanted to say or trying to work out what it was she really felt, or just simply pausing to consider, he would dash in and fill the space with his own words. His words were charming, convincing, and charismatic most of the time. But they were his, not hers.\n Liah\u2019s words came slowly forth into the space that had been left for them. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t. I have his memories. But I am not him.\u201d\n I\u2019m glad, thought Vanda, but she looked down at the dregs of her beer instead of saying so.\n \u201cAt first I was worried too, that people would think my results . . . weren\u2019t mine somehow, anymore. But I don\u2019t care. If it helps me. It opens doors.\u201d The look she threw Vanda was oddly defiant. \u201cPeople want my father\u2019s insights. The way he would combine two apparently separate ideas, and only then would you see that they were fundamentally isomorphic at some deep level. That is what he had, that is what he could do. I would do anything to get that.\u201d\n Vanda waited.\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really work like that, but I\u2019ll take anything I can and use anything I can. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d The ambition that Liah Je was known for made a stark and sudden appearance in her face.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Vanda said. And if they were going to decode the VAST\u2019s secrets they would need all the help they could get. \u201cWhat did you think when you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cFirst saw the VAST?\u201d Liah smiled, her tension fading, and Vanda could not help smiling in response. It was one of those oft-asked and discussed questions, almost a clich\u00e9 already. \u201cI was in Sydney,\u201d Liah said. \u201cA friend sent me a message. I thought it was a joke. Once I was finally convinced it was real, I knew it was a game changer. That nothing would ever go back in its box again, you know? I was excited and terrified all at once. I was all lit up and kind of expanded by it. And I kept just . . . crying. It was like being tossed around on some turbulent sea.\u201d She paused. \u201cIt\u2019s like there are not the proper words for it.\u201d She shook her head and her dark hair drifted back to where it had been.\n \u201cNot the proper words for it,\u201d repeated Vanda. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s our problem? Do you think it\u2019s all in there, but we just won\u2019t ever have the proper words?\u201d She knew that Liah knew what she was talking about. The physicists and cryptanalysts had found mathematical structure in the communications the VAST had been continuously broadcasting since it arrived. They could already tell that some of the data concerned the five platonic solids, and another section the electron configuration of the chemical elements. But the messages were built from only six protein structures, combining, and twining around each other in a way reminiscent of triple-stranded DNA. Vanda knew they were only scratching the surface.\n \u201cI\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll find the words,\u201d Liah said. \u201cI\u2019m betting that we do.\u201d She gave a rather irreverent grin. \u201cBut you never answered the question.\u201d\n \u201cWhat question?\u201d Vanda said.\n \u201cThe question you asked me. What was your reaction when you first saw the VAST?\u201d\n Vanda paused, to let all of the things she couldn\u2019t express rush into the space.\n \u201cI thought it was the end of the world,\u201d she said.\n Vanda, somewhere at the back of her mind, had always been waiting for the end of the world. Ruffled out of sleep by the noise of a jet or a truck making an odd low noise in the distance, she would sit up, and wait, and think, is this it? Is this how it comes? She used to wonder what it would sound like; a splintering crash; a high-pitched whine; a deep vibration on the very edge of what she could hear? She felt like she would recognize that moment, when everything ceased to be normal, and became something else instead. The moment when the end came hurtling toward her. The world could end in a million ways, but at its heart, that moment of realization would be deeply familiar, a coming home, a recognition. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time the world had ended.\n Niu Yi\n \u201cLook at this,\u201d said her grandmother, rubbing her fingers over the top of the picture as if she could glean the information through touch. Her grandmother couldn\u2019t see the photos hardly at all, Niu Yi guessed, but she could remember what each one was, and was unerringly correct.\n Niu Yi took the photo out of her grandmother\u2019s hands, and when she looked down at it something hurt. Here was that younger part of herself she thought she\u2019d outgrown and outcast. Here all along, waiting. It was a picture of herself, her hair bunched on both sides of her head, gap-toothed and smiling. Niu Yi had lived with her grandmother here at the end of the mountain until she was nine years old. She looked to be about six in the photo. Her na\u00efve, innocent, hopeful self. It was a happy photo. A happy time.\n \u201cYou\u2019re just like your mother here,\u201d her grandmother said, tapping the photo gently. \u201cYou could be her, almost.\u201d\n No. I\u2019m not like her. Niu Yi thought. She put the photo down on the table.\n \u201cGrandmother, the hospitals are really good now, they could do a good job to help your eyes. And I have credits, we can use my credits, I have more than enough.\u201d The government had given her more credits than she\u2019d ever dreamed of when she\u2019d been chosen as one of the eight thousand.\n Her grandmother shook her head slowly from side to side. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t trouble me, I haven\u2019t lost anything, it\u2019s all up here,\u201d she tapped the side of her head, and Niu Yi felt an odd small envy.\n \u201cBut it would be a gift, grandmother,\u201d Niu Yi said. It was custom to always accept a gift given with a whole heart.\n That night, as she tried to go to sleep listening to the eerie unearthly crooning of her grandmother\u2019s chickens roosting under the house, Niu Yi wished she could remember her mother\u2019s face.\n Vanda\n The first time the world had ended Vanda had been thirteen. Her family had been coming back from the beach, from her brother\u2019s junior swim-squad training. Her mother and father had been in the front of the car. Declan had been eight, only eight, he\u2019d been in the back with her, and she\u2019d just snapped at him to shut up because he\u2019d been trying to sing his stupid team song too loudly in a nasally purposely-out-of-tune voice. They went to overtake a truck that was turning in front of them, but a broken axle caused the truck to spin out of the corner, right into them.\n Time had folded back and over on itself like dough, and Vanda had felt like she was lost in the spinning and the screeching sound that was all around her. And then the endless motion and the noise had stopped, and she was sitting in what was left of the back seat, her side wet and warm although nothing hurt yet, nothing hurt at all, listening to her mother howling.\n Niu Yi\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got a visitor,\u201d Niu Yi\u2019s grandmother told her, as she returned to her grandmother\u2019s with yams and carrots. It was such an unexpected and implausible thing for her grandmother to say that Niu Yi stopped and stood still.\n A lean, well-dressed man came to the doorway. \u201cNiu Yi,\u201d he said, and took the hand that was not holding the vegetables.\n \u201cJing,\u201d she said. \u201cHow can you be here?\u201d\n She had met Wan Jing when they had both lived and worked at the Danzhai Wanda Tourist Village. Wanda\u2019s poverty abatement program had built the village back in 2017, nearly thirty years ago. Her mother had moved there shortly after the village was opened, one of the first students to attend the vocational college, leaving Niu Yi with her grandmother. And Niu Yi in her turn had lived there for nearly five years before heading to Shenzhen University. Her grandmother had never left her mountain, thought Niu Yi, then her mother spent her life in within the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, and now Niu Yi herself . . . who would go further than dreams.\n Jing had left Danzhai Wanda Village seven or eight months earlier than she did, and she hadn\u2019t seen him since.\n \u201cYou went to study engineering,\u201d she ventured almost shyly, as she showed him through the village, walking under the maple trees. Her grandmother would be killing a chicken to entertain their guest for dinner and had shooed them both out of the house.\n \u201cI am an engineer,\u201d Jing said. \u201cI work on the new high-speed train lines. And you wanted to study science.\u201d\n Niu Yi shot him a quick look before nodding in acknowledgement. She was surprised he remembered, and he\u2019d left before she\u2019d gone. But he hadn\u2019t stayed in touch, and after he hadn\u2019t returned her first message, she\u2019d not pursued it. He\u2019d vanished like he\u2019d been made of mist. And now he was here.\n \u201cI remember you doing the Golden Pheasant Dance at Spring Festival,\u201d Jing said with his soft and easy syllables. \u201cYour face fringed with silver.\u201d The traditional Miao garments involved an intricately beautiful silver headdress, spun light enough to wear on her head. She\u2019d worn a bright pleated skirt, embroidered in the way her grandmother had taught her. And she\u2019d been decked with silver bracelets, anklets, and earrings. There\u2019d been a trick to walking without making noise, although usually making noise was exactly what you wanted to do.\n They passed three men tiling a roof, singing together in antiphonal layers.\n \u201cAnd I remember you playing the lusheng,\u201d Niu Yi returned. He\u2019d been good at it, she\u2019d admired his sensitive fingers, and the delicate strains of his music. But she was much more direct these days than she used to be. \u201cJing, how are you here?\u201d\n \u201cCan I not be here?\u201d he said, his voice light, and reminiscent somehow of the way he sang, light yet rich with undertones.\n No, thought Niu Yi. This was not the village Jing was from. It made no sense to find him here.\n But she made bright conversation with him as they walked up the steep trails, and found herself laughing at his anecdotes. He told her how one of the main problems they were having with the train lines was due to millipedes. The millipedes were drawn to the tracks for some inexplicable reason and made their way along them. But when the train squishes the millipedes, all of those squishy millipede bodies reduce the friction between the train and the track, and all of the stopping time calculations are thrown out, and the drivers have trouble making the trains stop in time. As always, he knew how to pick just the right details to make a story compelling.\n \u201cBut why, why are they there?\u201d Niu Yi said, her hand over her mouth to try and hold back her giggle.\n \u201cNo one knows,\u201d Jing said with perfect solemnity.\n Jing had always been popular. He had always been at the center of things. Niu Yi had been caught in his orbit, with everyone else. Although it was a far-flung orbit, where she never got too close, always on the periphery.\n \u201cLook,\u201d Niu Yi said when she saw where their footsteps had led them. In the center of the village was a long rectangular mural, the sketching engraved directly into long panels of the wood itself. \u201cIt\u2019s our history,\u201d she said, almost reverently, her fingers tracing the grooves in the wood, the line of a tree, of maple leaves. The long journey to find a new home. Over mountains, through rivers. The Miao people had only had a written language since the 1950s. Before then the oral histories of a thousand years were passed down in word and song, flowing like a stream. But here it was, right here, in pictures. Pictures she couldn\u2019t take with her.\n \u201cThere\u2019s some room at the end here.\u201d Jing said, laying his palm on the blank wood.\n \u201cI guess the future is unwritten. Or undrawn.\u201d Niu Yi said lightly.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s next for our people? What goes here?\u201d he said, his tone matching the lightness of hers, although his eyes caught hers with an odd intensity. \u201cSpace? The stars? The wide universe? Maybe we should draw that?\u201d\n Niu Yi wanted to drop her eyes, but his gaze held her. \u201cYou know.\u201d Her voice raised up at the end, but it was not a question.\n \u201cNiu Yi,\u201d he said, and she felt like she was thrown back through time to the days were she would have given anything to have had him say her name like that. \u201cOf course. Of course I know. The news pods said there was a woman who used to dance in Wanda Danzhai Tourist Village. But even before I did the research, found all of the clues, asked all of the questions, somehow I knew it was going to turn out to be you.\u201d\n \u201cOh, really?\u201d Niu Yi tried to scoff. Why would anyone think that it would be her? And why should it be her anyway?\n But Jing\u2019s tone stayed serious. \u201cReally,\u201d he said.\n Children are time capsules, carrying our genes into the future.\n Vanda\n On Sundays Vanda usually flew down to Perth to visit her mother. There were multiple flights available per day now catering to the Denham Research Center and the influx of people heading up to catch a glimpse of the VAST in the sky.\n Vanda\u2019s mother sat out on her patio in her retirement community villa in a little wicker chair, with the sun streaming down. In one hand she held a small pair of silver nail-scissors, and the end of her braid in the other. Holding her hair up right in front of her eyes she was slowly and deliberately snipping the little ends of her hair where it forked and split. Her mother could sit and do this for hours, not looking up.\n \u201cHi Mum,\u201d Vanda said. Her mother paused, offered up her cheek to be kissed, then returned her focus to her hair. Snip. \u201cI brought you over some lasagna.\u201d\n \u201cDid you put it in the fridge?\u201d her mother asked, with exactly the same tone she would have used when she was the mother Vanda still remembered, her scissors glinting as they caught the sunlight. Snip, snip, snip.\n \u201cYes,\u201d Vanda caught her mother\u2019s hand and gently extracted the scissors, which she put down on the patio table. Her mother\u2019s hair was long and incongruously dark still, coiled in its braid. You could see the aging in her face though, in her sunken eyes and the lines around her mouth. Her hands, bereft of the scissors, fluttered around like little birds.\n Her mother looked at Vanda, shaking her head as if agitated. \u201cWhy is it you?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Declan be here?\u201d\n \u201cDeclan\u2019s gone, Mum,\u201d Vanda said. Her mother still knew that, she was pretty sure. It had been a long time since she had heard her brother\u2019s name, and saying it made something catch inside her, still.\n \u201cAll the other women in here are grandmothers,\u201d her mother said, her gaze suddenly sharpening and fixing on Vanda.\n Vanda swallowed something that was either a sigh, a sob, a hysterical giggle, or some messy hybrid of the three. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, Mum,\u201d she said, keeping her voice as gentle as she could. Her mother got caught by certain topics sometimes, and would circle around them, unable to leave them alone. This one came up a lot. But the internal injuries she\u2019d sustained during the car accident when she was a teenager had left her without a spleen, and without a uterus, and she\u2019d never carry a child.\n \u201cI guess you\u2019d need a husband for that, anyhow,\u201d her mother sniffed.\n Vanda could remember her mother, the mother she\u2019d had before the accident. Funny and intelligent and hotheaded. She\u2019d yell and throw her hands around dramatically, but she would soon be laughing and making up silly songs again soon enough. She was fiery, but she was never cruel.\n \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t got one of those anymore,\u201d Vanda said composedly. Her ex-husband had moved to Singapore two years ago for a new job. He\u2019d taken all of his words with him, all his funny, bright, charming words. I can\u2019t ask you to give up everything here to come with me, he\u2019d said. What he\u2019d meant was, I\u2019m leaving, it\u2019s over, I\u2019ve met someone else, although Vanda hadn\u2019t realized that till a bit later. She\u2019d told herself that she was devastated when he left, and she was, in a way. She\u2019d thought the house would be too quiet. But she\u2019d found that she had room, instead, to breathe, to expand.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want grandchildren anyway.\u201d Her mother, once on a track, could be hard to derail. She sat hunched in on herself, as if caught by her own gravity. A gravity so strong that the person she had been could never get out. Vanda thought that her mother probably had other words for her; nicer, kinder words, but they had collapsed inward, they would never make it past her mother\u2019s event horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s all a trick.\u201d\n \u201cWhat\u2019s a trick, Mum?\u201d said Vanda, thinking as she said it that probably she shouldn\u2019t have asked.\n \u201cHaving children,\u201d her mother said with a surprising amount of vehemence. \u201cMy body made me love you. It suffused me with oxytocin hormone, and I couldn\u2019t help it. And I do. I do yet.\u201d\n Vanda felt like she was holding her breath. When had she last ever heard her mother say she loved her, or even obliquely reference the fact?\n \u201cAnd this is what you think when your children are born. For a while you think that it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay that you are going to die one day, because your child exists, and your child will keep going, and because they are what is truly important. But it\u2019s a trick,\u201d her mother\u2019s voice rose up in a wail and Vanda made soft shushing sounds to try and soothe her. \u201cThey die when they are eight. Or they turn into a fully-grown human, and you don\u2019t know what goes on in their head or in their life. Because they are not yours anymore. And they are not you.\n \u201cThey come over and visit sometimes and make small talk and the line of their chin reminds you of yourself, but they are not you, they are some other person. You don\u2019t go on at all. You end. So it\u2019s a trick.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice faded away as if she were becalmed. Vanda held one of her hands, and chatted of inconsequential things, although she didn\u2019t think her mother was listening. And she thought of the all the questions about death she had cast at her mother when she was a small child, and when her mother walked on the earth still a whole person, not just all sharp jagged remnants of a person. Don\u2019t you mind? she had asked, bright and inquisitive, and terrified to her core by the thought of not existing, with the impunity of a four year old who had not yet learned not to ask these questions. And watching her mother\u2019s retreat back into herself now, shrinking under her own gravity, she knew that her mother did mind, that her mother had always minded.\n \u201cYou never stay long,\u201d her mother said as she got up to leave.\n \u201cI\u2019ve got my flight back up to Shark Bay,\u201d Vanda said, \u201cWorking on the VAST communications is pretty intense.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d her mother said, her voice thin and pale, the words coming up from somewhere very far, like they were red-shifted, moving away from her.\n Vanda brought up an image on her phone. She realized that she missed having the VAST overhead, missed being able to look up and see it. She was only some seven hundred kilometers away from it down in Perth, but the sky felt lacking now somehow. She didn\u2019t know what that meant.\n \u201cSee,\u201d she showed her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s called the Vermilion-Amber-Sunset-Tangerine, Mum. It\u2019s a spaceship.\u201d\n Her mother craned her neck so that she could see past the patio roof.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t see it from here,\u201d Vanda said.\n Her mother stayed looking at the sky, and for a moment Vanda felt like she would turn around, and it would be her mother again, the one she had as a kid, the one who\u2019d loved astronomy and climbed up onto the roof of the house with her and her brother to go stargazing.\n \u201cThat ship,\u201d her mother said. And Vanda waited, but nothing more was forthcoming.\n \u201cSee you next week, Mum,\u201d Vanda said, but her mother\u2019s hand was straying toward her scissors again, and she did not answer.\n Niu Yi\n The daily walks became a habit, almost a ritual. I\u2019m only here a fortnight, Niu Yi thought, how can this become such a set part of my day, so quickly, so naturally.\n \u201cWere you really in Danzhai already?\u201d she asked Jing, wondering at how familiar it was already, his form sitting beside her, how easy it was to say anything at all to him now. \u201cWas it really a coincidence?\u201d She thought she knew the answer.\n \u201cI hadn\u2019t been back in nearly a decade,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou came here to find me.\u201d Not something she would have dared say, not so very long ago. But she was leaving the whole Earth behind, and she had very little time to waste on pleasantries or shyness.\n \u201cI followed you up the mountain,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Jing bit his lip. Zia didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever seen him look as uncertain as he did now.\n \u201cDo you know how I\u2019ve felt since they chose me?\u201d she said, rushing in, suddenly not wanting to wait for his answer.\n \u201cHow?\u201d\n \u201cLike an imposter. Like a fake.\u201d\n \u201cHow could you ever be fake? You are the most real person I know.\u201d And his voice sounded like the gasp of summer.\n \u201cWhy on earth was it me?\u201d In her effort to have her voice not shake she came out sounding almost angry.\n Jing paused. \u201cGenetics.\u201d\n \u201cPhylogenetic analysis showed significant genetic differentiation to make us a distinct minority ethnic group. I know. But that applies to all of us. They could have chosen you.\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d There was something sad and distant in his eyes. \u201cAnd instead they chose you. Half genetics. Half lottery. The biggest, best lottery in the history of everything.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just it though.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is?\u201d\n \u201cThe history of everything? There are eight thousand, one hundred and ninety-two of us, only that. Carefully chosen, deliberately chosen to be representative of the cultures and races and peoples of Earth. Of as many variations as they could anyway, as they could fit into that number. They looked at genetic variations. They drew lines around cultures and decided that if your language was classified as a distinct language, not dialect, then culturally you were considered diverse too. But how are those choices anybody can make? And how are we meant to carry all of that? The history of everything? How am I meant to represent a whole culture? It\u2019s just me. One person is not enough. One person is not a culture.\u201d\n \u201cNo one said you had to carry everything with you.\u201d\n \u201cBut who else is going to?\u201d Niu Yi said.\n As Jing walked her back to her grandmother\u2019s, she told him about the lack of pictures in her head. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t take anything with me,\u201d she said \u201cOnly living matter can pass into Underlight. The VAST itself is one big living entity, although I don\u2019t really understand it.\u201d\n \u201cNothing at all?\u201d Jing said, and she could see the curiosity she\u2019d remembered quicken in his eyes.\n \u201cNo,\u201d said Niu Yi, and then she blushed. \u201cI\u2019ll lose my hair, my eyebrows. The top layers of my skin. It\u2019ll be just me.\u201d Her chin trembled.\n \u201cYou know \u2018Song of the Ancient Sweet Gum\u2019?\u201d Jing said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cThe rock was tired of being beaten to pound hemp into paper. And so it ate all the paper and all the books. And that is why we had no legacy of writing,\u201d said Jing.\n Niu Yi didn\u2019t know why he was quoting the song, but there was comfort in it somehow, nonetheless.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take writing, or pictures in your head, or anywhere else. You know the songs, and the poems,\u201d Jing said, and his hand reached down and found hers. \u201cYou will carry them, and they will carry you.\u201d\n Vanda\n \u201cAll of these structures remind me of a tonal language, where the same word can mean different things,\u201d Liah sighed. Her dark hair had escaped its restraint and she looked more ruffled than Vanda was used to seeing her, both in terms of appearance and attitude. Despite the breakthroughs that had recently come in from teams working in Chengdu and Boston, they were all feeling haunted by all that they couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cLike \u2018Ma\u2019 in Mandarin; it can mean mother, hemp, horse, or scold. Or it can be a word put at the end of a sentence to make it a question.\u201d Liah rubbed at her eyes.\n \u201cExcept we can\u2019t hear the tones,\u201d said Vanda. \u201cAnd the permutations just blow out exponentially.\u201d The long days were getting to her too. And at night she was restless, her sleeping brain filled with long strands of triple helixes, infecting her, winding around her, and spinning her loose, into the universe, into the night sky. She couldn\u2019t see the VAST at night, although she knew it was there.\n Niu Yi\n Niu Yi compared the roof tiles on the houses to pangolin scales, as they did in one of the epic poems. The beautifully pleated skirts all the women wore for the festivals she compared to mountain ridges. Jing came up to play his lusheng for her grandmother, and Niu Yi was reminded that it was the children of copper after the metals were born that became the tubes inside the bamboo instrument. She didn\u2019t need pictures of them to know them.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Jing, as they lingered watching the mist over the rice terraces. It was like Jing had been a piece of her memory, come to find her when she needed it. A part of her past, to remind her and bring her home.\n \u201cNiu Yi,\u201d he said, \u201ctake me with you.\u201d\n It was impossible, what was he saying that for, what was he-\n \u201cPart of me,\u201d Jing said. \u201cTake part of me with you.\u201d He leaned in closer, his eyes locked on hers. Then paused.\n It was a question made of the silence, the space between them.\n She used to love him, a long time ago. She was not that girl, and she did not love him anymore.\n But there were other reasons than love. Nostalgia. Connection. A thread, arcing back through time to the person she used to be, to an echo of herself. A way to mourn the life she would leave behind.\n She closed the gap between them and answered the question.\n Vanda\n Vanda set up the parallel processors to run her latest tweak of the convolutional neural network, then brought up her most recent myriad-graphs and put them in front of her tired eyes. Her brain refused to focus though. A vague guilt battered the edge of her awareness\u2014she had failed to get down to Perth last Sunday to visit her mother. Coupled with that was a curious reluctance to leave this site at all, even for twenty-four hours. These equations, these people, the way the VAST somehow rarefied the light; it was like her oxygen; she needed it.\n Her mind kept casting disparate images together, clashing like the sea against the rocks. Her ex-husband and the way he\u2019d never waited for her, never allowed her time to coax her own thoughts out. And her mother, her pauses, all the things that couldn\u2019t escape. And Liah, and the space between them. The way if you left something empty, there was room for something else to come forward into the space. The space, the spaces.\n \u201cLiah,\u201d she called. Her voice steady and soft, almost like she was in a dream. \u201cCan we load up the raw files from section 11.2E again?\u201d\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Liah, coming over and putting her hand on Vanda\u2019s shoulder.\n \u201cI think we are missing the tones, like you said,\u201d said Vanda. \u201cExcept they are not tones, they\u2019re silences. The pauses, the sections where the message waits. Where it stops. I think our extra layer is there in the negative space. I think we need to include that in our weightings.\u201d\n There was a moment, and then Vanda heard Liah\u2019s indrawn breath. \u201cI know which protocol we need to adjust the weightings,\u201d she said. Then her voice lowered, pitched just for Vanda. \u201cIt was one of my father\u2019s. But he never got to publish that paper. It was just in his head.\u201d Her voice hitched with wonder. \u201cOh, I see it. I see how we can apply it.\u201d\n Vanda turned around. When Liah was excited her eyes looked like they were full of stars.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get the team together,\u201d she said.\n Niu Yi\n Over their evening meal of sour and spicy fish soup, Niu Yi\u2019s grandmother said that she would come down the mountain with her, to the main hospital in Guiyang.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll get your eyes done?\u201d Niu Yi said, surprised, but pleased.\n \u201cNo,\u201d said her grandmother. \u201cAll my life I have lived in this village. I think I will catch a ride with you.\u201d\n Vanda\n The message layers superimposed over each other, merging and blending. Then the intricacy of the data came flooding forward into the space they had left for it, falling suddenly into meaning. There was a beauty to it that made Vanda gasp.\n She floated on a cloud of satisfaction and achievement and euphoria for several hours until the message cohered into a whole and came crashing down on her, bringing the world with it.\n Niu Yi\n A gift given with a whole heart.\n Niu Yi\u2019s grandmother had given her the memory-gift, although Niu Yi tried her hardest to refuse it. But her grandmother had been more determined than Niu Yi had ever seen her, and she was not someone Niu Yi knew how to disobey. She\u2019d thought that the person had to be dying in order to give their memories, but apparently it was also done this way, although it was not common.\n Niu Yi\u2019s head felt crowded, like she was all stuffy from a cold. Her grandmother\u2019s memories would catch and flare inside her mind like embers, but Niu Yi was too full of grief to pay attention to them properly.\n Niu Yi was feeling nauseous and would have given anything for a hot bowl of her grandmother\u2019s oil tea, but her grandmother did not make it anymore. Niu Yi wondered whether she was carrying Jing\u2019s child. Whether it was even possible for something to grow in Underlight, or whether it would lie curled up within her, dormant and sleeping, until the end of time.\n Her grandmother had gone to live with Niu Yi\u2019s uncle. She was diminutive now\u2014she had always been tiny, but she had never seemed so before. She would smile pleasantly and make polite conversation and sit for hours with the sunlight on her face, but she did not remember the mountain.\n Vanda\n You could want something all your life, at a fundamental level, your cells crying out for it, and not get it, Vanda knew this. Because it was not for you.\n According to the VAST, in eighty-three years a gamma ray burst caused by the collapse of a supermassive star would reach Earth\u2019s solar system. With Earth in its collimated narrow beam path.\n Vanda would not be alive in eighty-three years. Nor was she capable of having any descendants who would be living on the Earth. Her whole family would be gone, already. Most of them already were. And yet.\n In eleven years the VAST would depart, taking with it eight thousand, one hundred and ninety-two human beings, if they chose. It would travel into \u201cUnderlight.\u201d\n But Vanda would not be one of them. Not for you the chance to live forever. Not for you.\n In Underlight the more than eight thousand people would live and think and interact, but time would not find them. It was an oddly poetic sentence structure from the VAST, but all of the models said it was accurate. The VAST was sitting there in the sky, waiting for them. Alive itself in a different way\u2014a way that had not traded immortality for quick-use disposable bodies that needed offspring to hurtle their genes into the future. It was only itself over and over again and always. They would come out of Underlight, after millennia, to arrive at another world.\n To know there were people alive today who would continue out there, somehow underneath and between normal space, for close enough to forever, past their natural span, past anything anyone had expected or deserved. Didn\u2019t that help? Wasn\u2019t that enough?\n No.\n It wasn\u2019t.\n When this had coalesced for Vanda, initially a rampaging jealousy had suffused her. It\u2019s not fair, she shrieked silently somewhere deep within herself. Oh, it\u2019s not fair.\n But the emotion had blown through her like a tremendous gust of wind, into all of the smallest parts of her, through her, and away.\n Don\u2019t you mind? she had asked her mother, when she was four years old. Don\u2019t you mind?\n And of course she minded. But this was not for her.\n She had what she had always had.\n A life.\n A singular unique and unremarkable and finite life. Here, on this planet.\n \u201cPoor dolphins,\u201d said Liah. The sunlight was shining on the water, and they watched the dolphins take their fish and then come back to cheekily splash the people standing in the shallows.\n \u201cThey deserve to go too. Everything does,\u201d said Vanda, up to her knees in the sea, her rolled up jeans getting wetter and wetter.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not going to give up any of those tickets to the latest greatest last best show in the universe to animals.\u201d Then Liah\u2019s voice became serious. \u201cHow would we ask a dolphin what it would choose anyway?\u201d\n \u201cWhat would you choose?\u201d Vanda said, shading her eyes against the glare. The VAST was overhead, but she didn\u2019t look up at it. She would stay here, she\u2019d already decided, even once their work wrapped up. She would live up here with the ocean and the wind and the spaceship that would stay like a promise in the sky for eleven more years.\n \u201cWhat would you choose?\u201d Liah countered, teasing lights in her eyes. \u201cWould you go if you could?\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d said Vanda simply. It was her central and unchanging truth. Of course. Of course. But it was not for her. Someone else would go. Eight thousand, one hundred and ninety-two someone elses. \u201cWould you?\u201d\n \u201cWould I want to live forever?\u201d Liah said, and she looked out to the horizon, where it was all ocean as far as the eye could see, like it was the end of the world. \u201cOnly if I could take you with me.\u201d\n Niu Yi\n Niu Yi would carry them all, as best she could. She would carry them past the stars, she would carry them to the end of the universe.\n The official escorts would be arriving soon. To take her to the airport where she would board a private plane to Australia, where there would be over eight thousand people from around the globe. But she was in no hurry.\n Niu Yi turned her attention to the white page in front of her. She pictured her mother\u2019s face, clear in her mind; the curve of her cheek, the expression in her eyes as she stood in Niu Yi\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, with her newborn daughter in her arms. Niu Yi picked up her charcoal. And she drew a line.\n Samantha Murray is a writer, mathematician, and mother. Not particularly in that order.

I myself have never been interested in being a prophet of any kind. [ . . . ] But when your antennae are out there waving in the breeze and you allow them to develop because you think of yourself as an artist, you will undoubtedly pick up some signals from somewhere in the Videodrome way that other people don\u2019t pick up.\u201d\n\u2014David Cronenberg, 2004 audio commentary to Videodrome\n\u201cMr. Cronenberg, who also directed Scanners, is developing a real genius for this sort of thing; one measure of the innovativeness of Videodrome is that it feels vaguely futuristic, even though it's apparently set in the present.\u201d\n\u2014Janet Maslin, 1983 New York Times review of Videodrome\nDavid Cronenberg\u2019s 1983 feature Videodrome opens with a scene whose full eeriness isn\u2019t apparent without scrutiny. As the camera moves slowly away from a television, a bumper ad for Civic TV (\u201cThe one you take to bed with you\u201d) gets replaced by a woman who begins speaking directly to the sleeping figure in front of the screen, revealed as the camera pulls back to be protagonist Max Renn (James Woods). \u201cMax, it\u2019s that time again,\u201d she says before teasingly reeling off his daily to-do list. As she concludes, the screen cuts to another bumper and then, with a flick of Max\u2019s finger accompanied by a click on the soundtrack, the image disappears. The peculiarity of being woken up by a personally recorded agenda aside, it looks like a mundane moment. Look closely, however, and you\u2019ll see that Max isn\u2019t holding a remote.\nVideodrome ends with a bookend scene. Max is elsewhere, in front of another TV screen, taking orders delivered in a much more commanding tone from a different woman. The orders lead him to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger, causing the television to explode in a geyser of viscera, the last in a series of images that explicitly fuse flesh and circuitry. But the fusion is there from the start. A hand flicks. A machine responds. An everyday gesture is made unnerving by the removal of a mediating device. Max ends the film a convert hailing the age of \u201cthe New Flesh\u201d and eliminating its enemies before taking his own life, but the opening moments suggest he joined the New Flesh ranks long ago.\nCronenberg\u2019s film takes the ways technology changes, and merges with, humanity as its central theme and it\u2019s filled with early \u201980s devices and imagery that support that theme: videocassettes, Atari controllers, pirate satellite dishes. It\u2019s a diagnosis of the modern condition from an era when Sting still seemed cool. But it\u2019s also a remarkably prescient film, an analog vision of the digital future waiting just around the corner and the new intimacy our minds and bodies would assume with the machinery we created to serve us, an intimacy for which sex would serve as a gateway.\nNo mere consumer of Civic TV, Max owns the station, a far-end-of-the-dial UHF outfit that specializes in programming other stations won\u2019t touch, including soft-core pornography. Early in the film, Max considers picking up a series called Samurai Dreams, but worries it won\u2019t catch fire with his late-night viewers. \u201cThere\u2019s something too soft about it,\u201d he asks, before expressing a desire for \u201csomething tough.\u201d\nIn the 1980s, pornography\u2014soft and otherwise\u2014remained in the margins, where it had retreated once again after a brief explosion of \u201cporno chic\u201d in the early \u201970s that found Deep Throat and other hardcore films playing in mainstream theaters. With pornography easy to access\u2014even difficult to avoid\u2014on the Internet, it\u2019s hard to imagine a time when kids tried to catch bits of action in the brief moments of clarity on cable systems\u2019 scrambled channels. But even in the \u201980s, the margins were drawing in. Cinemax regularly played softcore fare from the previous decade\u2014made mostly in Europe and Australia\u2014in its late-night slots and the many video stores springing up usually featured an adults-only section. Civic TV even had a real-life precedent too in Toronto, Cronenberg\u2019s hometown and the setting for much of the film, where a station called Citytv ran a series called Baby Blue Movie in the wee hours of the weekend.\nMax is ahead of his time in sensing the rougher appetites of the years to come as well. Exposed by Harlan, one of the station\u2019s engineers, to the sadistic images of torture and abuse that constitute the entirety of a television program known as Videodrome, Max senses an opportunity to get ahead of the programming curve by moving immediately to its extreme. In some respects, he had the right idea. Within a few years, mainstream depictions of sex would shift in emphasis from joy to danger as the T&A films of the early part of the decade gave way to the erotic thrillers of its latter half, a trend that would continue through much of the \u201990s. The reasons aren\u2019t hard to discern. AIDS invested sex with a fearfulness it hadn\u2019t had before and as the mood of the country grew increasingly conservative, free expressions of sex fell out of favor. The peephole shower scene of Porky\u2019s gave way to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct (whose sequel Cronenberg, however improbably, almost directed). Increasingly, culturally dominant fantasies of sex became tangled up with images of death.\nThat\u2019s a tangling that\u2019s fascinated Cronenberg throughout his career. A self-described Freudian, he\u2019s returned again and again to the place where Thanatos meets Eros in films like Shivers (his first film to find a wide audience) and Crash (a film whose surrounding controversy almost kept it from finding much of an audience at all). Videodrome stirs something within Max as well. Though he speaks of it as a wise investment\u2014think of the low overhead\u2014he returns to it as a viewer and as he be begins a relationship with Nikki Brand, a local radio personality with a masochistic streak, and possibly a death wish, played by Debbie Harry. Videodrome becomes a central part of their relationship. They watch it and grow inspired to push their personal limits.\nFor Nikki, that includes burning her breast with a cigarette (a visual pun on her last name that also provides another example of a piece of technology, however crude, altering a human body). The moment at first repulses Max, but not enough to scare him away and the film suggests that watching Videodrome has opened him up to some deep, unspoken desires, desires that Nikki anticipates and accommodates, becoming their embodiment, almost like a customized porn channel tuned into his particular interests, even those he has trouble saying out loud.\nWhether by design or as a consequence of Harry\u2019s monotone performance, Nikki never quite seems fully human, more like a projection of Max\u2019s psyche as a real woman. She\u2019s also a herald of the sexual near-future. The Internet has both brought the underground channels which those whose sexual tastes fall outside the mainstream closer to the surface (and helped redefined the mainstream in the process). It\u2019s met the needs of those more interested in watching, too. With a potentially infinite audience, there seems to be no fetish too obscure and no fantasy too extreme for someone not to be realizing it somewhere online. Nikki\u2019s a fantasy seemingly willed into flesh, but she\u2019s also a vision of a time when such fantasies would be only a few keystrokes away.\nIn time, Nikki goes in search of Videodrome itself, returning to Max only as an alluring vision to draw him deeper into its world. At this point the film doesn\u2019t abandon sex or, especially, sexual imagery, but it becomes apparent that both the film itself, and the world within it, have broader concerns. When Nikki and Max first meet, it\u2019s as part of a talk show about \u201ctelevision and social responsibility\u201d where they\u2019re joined by a third guest, \u201cmedia prophet\u201d Brian O\u2019Blivion. Declining to appear in person, for reasons that will become clear later, in the film, O\u2019Blivion appears on a TV monitor, speaking aphorisms that sound both cryptic and correct, like \u201cThe television screen has become the retina of the mind's eye\u201d and \u201cSoon all of us will have special names, names designed to cause the cathode ray tube to resonate.\u201d\nCronenberg modeled O\u2019Blivion after Marshall McLuhan, a fellow Canadian who emerged as the preeminent media theorist of the 1960s. McLuhan believed himself to be living in a moment of transition, with humanity transitioning into a \u201cpostliterate\u201d age thanks to the rise of electronic media, a rise that began with the telegraph and had carried on through the television and beyond. \u201cAllmedia, from the phonetic alphabet to the computer, are extensions of man that cause deep and lasting changes in him and transform his environment,\u201d McLuhan told Playboy in a 1969 interview. Videodrome runs with those notions, making literal the fusion of bodies and machinery, most famously in scenes in which Max\u2019s belly develops a vagina-like opening capable of admitting a videocassette (and, later, a gun).\nMcLuhan\u2019s been going in and out of academic fashion since his heyday, suffering the fate of all those hailed as a prophet in their own time whose predictions don\u2019t come true. (His vision of a United States soon to break up into \u201ca series of regional and racial ministates,\u201d for instance, remains unfulfilled.) But his concept of a \u201cGlobal Village\u201d has more than a little in common with ways the Internet has reshaped the world and the core principle beneath his theories\u2014that the media we create reshapes the way we see and interact with the world\u2014seems tough to deny.\nVideodrome takes that notion to its extreme with images of technology that reshape bodies to fit its needs or, more accurately, images of bodies bending to find common ground with new technology. Television becomes a part of the sexual process and Max\u2019s body responds in kind (even if, as we later discover, only in hallucination). The television returns the favor, becoming of orifice for Max to enter. In one of the many videotapes he leaves behind to sustain his existence after death, O\u2019Blivion speaks of the brain tumor that killed him, a tumor brought about by the signal placed beneath Videodrome, as \u201ca new organ.\u201d It\u2019s evolution\u2014both biological and technological\u2014working in tandem and in fast-forward.\nAs memorable as Rick Baker\u2019s special effects work is in Videodrome, it\u2019s the way Cronenberg makes even the most grotesque imagery sprout from recognizable psychological terrain that makes it so effective. The film makes literal a new relationship between humanity and technology then happening under the skin, a relationship that\u2019s only grown more intense in the thirty years since Videodrome\u2019s release. Both McLuhan and Cronenberg articulated visions of the computer age to come based on the technology at hand. (Cronenberg\u2019s 1999 videogame and virtual reality-inspired film Existenz updates some of Videodrome\u2019s themes for the CD-Rom era.) But for both men\u2019s work to resonate getting the details right matters less than understanding the principles beneath the details. In 1983, Max\u2019s waking up to a screen telling him what to do looked novel. Thirty years later, how wake up and check a laptop, or a tablet, or a smart phone to discern the shape of the day?\nVideodrome got much right about the future of television. In her liner notes to the 2004 DVD release, critic Carrie Rickey notes \u201cwhat was satire in its own day has turned out to be eerily accurate in its prediction of the TV landscape at the millennium, with its reality shows that suggest public life on TV is \u2018more real\u2019 than private life in the flesh.\u201d It got even more right about, well, the future. Within a few years of the film\u2019s release, cyberpunk would become ascendant and with it a concern with the divide between the virtual and the real. Videodrome looks to a time beyond that, a point when the divide between humans their technology and the realities those technologies create would become impossible to discern.\nIn the same Playboy interview, McLuhan says, \u201c20th Century man\u2019s relationship to the computer is not by nature very different from prehistoric man\u2019s relationship to his boat or to his wheel\u2014with the important difference that all previous technologies or extensions of man were partial and fragmentary, whereas the electric is total and inclusive. Now man is beginning to wear his brain outside his skull and his nerves outside his skin; new technology breeds new man.\u201d He could easily be talking about Max at the end of Videodrome, after he becomes an operative for the forces of O\u2019Blivion\u2019s New Flesh. Or he could be talking about you and me, whose brains have become accustomed to regularly checking email or Twitter or Facebook, who feel disconnected from the world when the 3G drops out, who use text messages to tell others they love them, or want them, or miss them, and who will live on in online trace, O\u2019Blivion-like, after our bodies have died. We\u2019re all living in New Flesh now.\nKeith Phipps is a Chicago-based writer and editor specializing in pop culture. From 1996 until 2012 he worked for The A.V.

Just going by years alone, she was way older than me, but that kind of comparison didn\u2019t really mean much: the planet where Chaeeunshinji was from and the one where I came from each had slightly different rotational and sidereal periods, so that the relative lengths of days and years on those worlds worked out to be just different enough to be confusing.\n\u201cWell, technically I\u2019m in my late teens, but you\u2019re just a little kid, so officially I\u2019m your big sister.\u201d\n\u201cBut who would go by that? If you count by wake-sleep cycles, I\u2019ve lived longer than you!\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine, let\u2019s count it up exactly, right now. Then we\u2019ll see who comes out on top, night or day . . . \u201d\n\u201cOkay\u2014knight and dame, let\u2019s try . . . \u201d\n\u201cTry what? No, no, don\u2019t explain it; that always kills a joke. Just forget it, okay? Let\u2019s just calculate it today, and do it right. No giving up halfway along again, alright? Now, what was your planet\u2019s rotation period?\u201d\n\u201cUh, wait a sec, I wrote that down someplace.\u201d\n\u201cYou dummy! You don\u2019t even know its rotation period? Even if you only ever heard it once, you should\u2019ve been able to remember it.\u201d\n\u201cI told you last time\u2014you wouldn\u2019t be able to remember it either, if you only heard it once.\u201d\nWhenever the adults were away working in their labs, Chaeeunshinji and I always returned to our ceaseless war. We were both the type who\u2019d rather die than lose an argument, and our clashes almost always continued until the grown-ups came back home after finishing their daily work.\nSometimes they\u2019d watch us fight like that for a while, and then they used to say stuff like: \u201cIs it really so fun, that you two always stick together like that, jabbering at each other all day long? Don\u2019t you kids ever get tired of it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s always talking crap about my name.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cHe keeps joking about how he can\u2019t tell where my family name ends and my given name begins. And he keeps calling me \u2018Eunshinji\u2019!\u201d\nShinji, Eunshinji, Chaeeunshinji. I couldn\u2019t say how old each of us had gotten while we were back on the worlds we\u2019d lived on before coming here, but here in our new home, on this planet that was named GreenScallion, we\u2019d both aged exactly three years, not a day more or less . . . and we\u2019d spent every single one of those days at war with each other, without even a single day off. And we went on like that, too, right up until the war broke out.\nActually, the war had nothing to do with us, not really. It happened mostly out in space, so we never saw any sign of the actual fighting, nothing at all. For us, everything just went on as usual. But one day, sometime in the afternoon, the executive director of my mom\u2019s research center dropped by our house and notified us that a war had broken out. After that, things seemed to change, little by little. That was because suddenly there were things like which people we could talk to, and which we shouldn\u2019t; which place we could go, and which place we must never go. In other words, we had a kind of front line to the war right inside our village. The lines were on a map, but they weren\u2019t actually there on the ground. They were the lines that didn\u2019t really exist, except as words someone had said.\nAnd Chaeeunshinji\u2019s house was on far side of that stupid line.\n\u201cCan\u2019t I go and see her?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cNever?\u201d\n\u201cNo, just for a while.\u201d\nThat was the new rule my mom handed down to me: no more meeting up with Chaeeunshinji and fighting all day long. To me, that was what the war really meant: separating us so we couldn\u2019t fight anymore. As for how the war was going, well, things got more and more serious every day. Attack ships appeared, flying under the clouds. With loud noise and their fancy glittering lights flashing, those tiny dots flew slowly over our heads. Whenever evening fell, every single grownup looked up in that direction and talked about all kinds of things with worried expressions:\n\u201cLike the rumors said . . . they must\u2019ve dispatched attack ships that can fly inside the atmosphere.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a huge deal! The war front could expand planetside, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, not really. We don\u2019t even have a single attack ship on our side, so it\u2019s not like the war front is expanding, it\u2019s more a case of a single attack ship being capable of conquering us all here.\u201d\n\u201cSo then . . . what? Should we attack it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, we just surrender. We\u2019re not soldiers or war prisoners, so nothing much will happen to us.\u201d\nThe director of our research center freaked out; he got really upset when he heard that word, surrender, but no one else really cared.\nWhat the grown-ups were worried about was that the fight going on out in space would spread down onto the planet. In fact, where we were living, there was no chance that any of us would even see actual soldiers or weapons: given the insane amount of energy required to enter and exit our atmosphere, those soldiers weren\u2019t planning to fight any battles inside GreenScallion\u2019s gravity-well.\nHowever, the story would change as soon as an attack ship flew inside the atmosphere; supposedly because the kind of weapons they use in space are unimaginably scary.\nWhat bothered me was how everyone suddenly started calling that dot in the sky our \u201cenemy.\u201d Did that mean that those scary weapons were gonna swoop right down over our heads and blow up just our research centers, but leave Chaeeunshinji\u2019s centers untouched? If they wanted to destroy anything, they\u2019d have to destroy them all at once, wouldn\u2019t they? Even just thinking about that made me feel so damn bad.\nLuckily, none of that stuff happened in real life.\nThere was a technician named Mr. Dallu who came back to our village a couple of months after the war started. He was the one who updated us on how the war was going. He roared with laughter after he saw the grown-ups staring up into the sky and muttering worried comments to one another.\n\u201cAw, that stuff\u2019s all fake,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we not worry? I can\u2019t get any work done at all, seeing that thing floating around up there like that. The engine\u2019s so loud when it flies over us! I can\u2019t just pretend I can\u2019t hear that noise.\u201d\n\u201cThat noise\u2014that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying is fake! That noise is fake! Look, I lived on one of their military outposts about a decade ago. In fact, that\u2019s what I did over there . . . \u201d\n\u201cBuilding warships for them? What the hell, are you bullshitting us?\u201d\n\u201cNo, wait, I didn\u2019t say I built their attack ships. I\u2019m saying I installed those noise generators on them. The volume output was really incredible! I mean, back then I actually wondered why they wanted me to install that kind of gear on their warships. But now I know why. Why they didn\u2019t bother to install any weapons, just an audio system. You guys are already shaking with fear, just from that sound. I\u2019m pretty sure their attack ships couldn\u2019t even handle a payload like a proper weapon. I mean, if you looked closely at it, it\u2019d look kind of off somehow, wouldn\u2019t it? I\u2019d bet it\u2019s never even come any lower to the ground than it is now, either, has it?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s . . . \u201d\n\u201cSee? Just ignore it. Just go on doing whatever you used to do, business as usual, because I\u2019m telling you, nothing\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\u201cTheir homeworld might send out another military vessel as backup.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean a landing ship? And what exactly would they achieve by dropping down into the atmosphere? Do you see anyplace worth conquering around here?\u201d\n\u201cBut . . . \u201d\n\u201cBut what? Do you know how much it costs to send a single military vessel all down here like that? This is a fight to take over the planet, sure, but it\u2019s not fight over our piddly little research center. There\u2019s no point for them to send around any kind of serious deployment like that.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure! Listen to that noise. It\u2019s real scary, isn\u2019t it? Well, I hate to break it to you, but that\u2019s not an engine sound. I\u2019ve never heard a single engine that sounded anything like that in my whole life. It\u2019s not an engine. They\u2019re pumping that sound out on purpose. Sure, it\u2019s loud, but that thing\u2019s gotta be empty. All you\u2019re hearing is vibrations in the air, no different from the sound of the wind.\u201d\nSuddenly, from that moment, all our stress miraculously disappeared, and we returned to our calm routine. Of course, every evening that attack ship hovered just beneath the clouds, emitting that deafening sound at us, and I still was forbidden to meet and squabble with Chaeeunshinji, but at least I never saw anyone around me shivering in terror anymore.\nIn fact, on some days, you even could hear laughter and occasionally singing inside the research center. Not that the war was over yet: like Mr. Dallu said, nothing military happened, no attack ships descending down into the atmosphere toward us, but, even indirectly, the war still affected all of us.\nThe real meaning of the war, for me, was what I saw on Chaeeunshinji\u2019s face when I ran into her on the street one day, just out of blue. Without a word, her expression warned: Don\u2019t talk to me. I\u2019m not supposed to talk to you. Silently, I mouthed the single word I wanted to ask her: Why? I knew what she was supposed to say to me then, just like she always had\u2014\u201cDummy, don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u2014but instead Chaeeunshinji said nothing. That, for me, that was how her silent face became a symbol for the war.\nBy then, the planet was totally shut down: the two armies had managed to utterly cut us off. What I mean is, there was no way for supply ships to get in or out. And since there was nothing growing on the planet that human beings could harvest for food, cutting off supply shipments also meant the prospect of going hungry.\n\u201cSo how are we supposed to live like this? Don\u2019t they need to evacuate us?\u201d said one of the grown-ups.\nThen the executive director\u2019s secretary replied, \u201cWell, it\u2019s not that simple. We aren\u2019t just civilians: we\u2019re important personnel here, so evacuation\u2019s not going to be possible for now. Still, it looks like there\u2019s a supply ship headed our way soon. That said, it obviously won\u2019t be a big one.\u201d\n\u201cAre they trying to make the supply drop with a small ship? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s fewer of us here than before. How are we supposed to get by if they only send a smaller supply ship? D\u2019you think they\u2019re even trying to send us enough for, like, war rations or whatever?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the director looked into that, and apparently they\u2019re trying to send multiple small, self-piloting ships. That way, what we\u2019ll receive will be sufficient for wartime rationing.\u201d\n\u201cSelf-piloting? Those little things? If they\u2019re trying to send the same amount of cargo as before, in such little ships, it\u2019s going to increase costs exponentially! Are they really going to do that? Won\u2019t they just end up cutting back on how many supplies they send? We\u2019ve got kids here . . . what are we supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s what they\u2019re offering, despite the elevated cost. I guess we have no choice. For now, we need to trust them . . . and besides, there\u2019s really no other option. I mean, what can we do if they refuse us? Of course, we definitely should request evacuation if things become more serious, but it\u2019s really not at that point yet, here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about? Things already are serious.\u201d\nThe next morning, the director got a transmission with the schedule and rationing plans for our wartime supply shipments. All things considered, the menu wasn\u2019t really so bad. Not that they were delivering cooked meals, of course: the idea was that they\u2019d calculate the necessary ingredients for each meal we\u2019d be having, and then deliver all of that once a month. Organic photosynthetic vegetables, livestock mammal meats, five different kinds of cheese, Earth-styled grain flours, and fruit and seafood raised on zero-g farms: nothing but the best . . . in other words, stuff like they eat back on Earth. They even included wine and beer on the list, and desserts like cakes and puddings. Our director even joked that we might even end up eating better than usual, if things went according to plan.\nUnfortunately, though, things didn\u2019t go according to plan. Honestly, the wartime supply system was a complete mess. The problem wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t send us the stuff, or what they sent; the problem was how they sent it, and when it arrived. For example, the zero-g farm that produced the seafood was close to GreenScallion, so on the day when it came, it was pretty fresh, and was just as much as the supply manifest specified. Except . . . that was all we got: a month\u2019s worth of seafood.\nThen, on another random day, the grain flours came. Just the flours. Then, another day, the fruit, and on another, the meat. Everything came, just like they promised, but it all came separately.\nYou might think we could\u2019ve just put it into storage and started eating it, but it wasn\u2019t so simple as that. To start storing up stuff, we had to cut back on what we were eating, so there\u2019d be some left until the next shipment . . . and that was what we did. By setting aside a little bit here and a little bit there, we figured that over time we might pack our larder with a balanced mix of ingredients. Eventually, though, when the only thing that arrived was a month\u2019s ration of beer, we couldn\u2019t help but start to worry. After all, it\u2019s not like we could survive on beer alone.\nWhen we complained, the director said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s because they couldn\u2019t gather all the ingredients together\u2014so instead they sent what they did have on hand as quickly as they could. Besides, the supply ships are so small that they couldn\u2019t package everything together anyway. There\u2019s no choice but to make do with frequent, multiple shipments . . . \u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what the reasons are,\u201d snapped Mr. Dallu. \u201cWho the hell thought they should send this crap to us this way? I\u2019d like a look at the face of the jerk they have calling the shots on this.\u201d\nIn a lot of ways, it was an exhausting time. We never knew what shipment might come in next, or whether we might find ourselves suddenly cut off completely, so we ended up having to make it our top priority to store and save up food, no matter what.\nThen a shipment of meat arrived.\nAnd then, another shipment of meat.\nAnd then, two weeks later\u2014yet another shipment of meat.\nWe ran out of beer, and then vegetables, and then fruit, and finally when we were down to having almost nothing else, we just started eating meat alone, every day, twice a day. For a while after that, we really had nothing else to eat but meat.\nFinally, about ten days later, the next supply ship we\u2019d been awaiting finally arrived\u2014\n\u2014carrying nothing but fresh pork.\n\u201cCome on, Director, how long are we supposed to scrape by like this?\u201d shouted Mr. Dallu. \u201cCan\u2019t we just submit a request for evacuation?\u201d Of course he was the first to blow his stack about it.\nEveryone in the research center looked over at the director, who calmly said, \u201cLet\u2019s hang in there just a little longer. The upper administration must be considering our situation seriously. It\u2019s just that we research personnel are the only population on this damned planet. If we\u2019re evacuated, that means their research team will be the only people left here, and that means they\u2019ll exceed the required 80% minimum of population share required to stake a colony-claim on world. I\u2019m not saying we ought to stake a claim on the planet, you know, just that we can\u2019t let them claim it. We need to stay so that it can remain unclaimed, and open to exploration, just like it is right now.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, fine, fine. Still, do me a favor and tell off the bastard who arranged these damned shipments. Don\u2019t take this lying down! What good does that do us? Just curse \u2019em a fucking blue streak, okay?!\u201d\nAs the war continued, the grown-ups kept on doing what they\u2019d always been doing. Actually, there wasn\u2019t really much else for them to do anyway.\nWar is so boring. When all the grown-ups went to work, I had to spend the whole day all alone. Out of all the research families on our side, there were six other kids around my age, but I didn\u2019t really like hanging out with most of them. Sure, later on I found that it was actually them who had started avoided me first. Probably, I guess, because unlike me, all their parents were part of the research team.\nMy mom, on the other hand, was a hairstylist. A terrible hairstylist\u2014and the only one in the whole research complex. When people grumbled at her about the haircuts she gave them, she used to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! My training is actually in zero-grav hairstyling, so . . . when I\u2019m styling hair under gravity, I guess I have two left thumbs. Someday I want to open a hair shop at an orbital junction, and when I do, please drop by and I\u2019ll give you a fabulous new hairstyle for free!\u201d\nAll of that was actually true: Mom had been a popular hairstylist, back on the spaceships and junctions. She\u2019d actually had been so famous that she\u2019d usually cut the hair of celebrities and famous people. But nobody at the research center cared about all that. It\u2019s not like I was exactly discriminated against because of my mom\u2019s job, but somehow I never felt very close with all of the scientists\u2019 kids, and I always felt left out.\nI took to wandering the borderline alone. It only appeared on maps, and yet it blocked my way forward just as surely as an invisible wall. A few grown-ups teased me, asking, \u201cYou planning to go into exile?\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what that word meant.\nWait a sec, I thought to myself. Chaeeunshinji\u2019s parents were both researchers too. Why did I end up hanging out with her, and fighting all the time whenever we met?\nI picked up my binoculars and squatted down somewhere near the borderline. Staring through my binoculars, I slowly scanned Chaeeunshinji\u2019s research center, the front yard of her house, the roof. I wondered how she doing. Had she found herself someone else to squabble with every day?\nShinji, Eunshinji, Chaeshinji, Chaeeunshinji. I murmured her name softly to myself as I spied on the other side of the borderline for what felt like a pretty long time. At some point, I finally discovered a suspicious-looking shadow hidden behind a tree on the roof of their research center. There was another kid hiding behind that tree, like some kind of spy, and I could make out a pair of binoculars sticking out from the hiding spot. At that moment, the kid\u2019s binoculars suddenly turned toward me. I had no time to look away, so suddenly I met that other kid\u2019s eyes. Well, I mean, our binoculars met.\nWhat\u2019re you doing, Eunshinji?\nChaeeunshinji made the first move, waving at me across that borderline. I followed suit, waving back at her. And that was it: nothing else happened that day. When it got dark, Chaeeunshinji marched back toward her house, keeping her posture the same and even holding those binoculars over her eyes all the way. I did the same thing . . . well, except I didn\u2019t do anything weird like walking around with binoculars in front of my eyes.\nThe next day, I went back to that spot with my binoculars. It took about ten minutes before Chaeeunshinji showed up, and then she opened up this huge sketchbook and showed me what she\u2019d written inside it beforehand.\n\u2014HEY, SPY! I HEARD YOU GUYS HAVE NOTHING TO EAT. WE\u2019VE GOT TONS!\nThen she held up a peach and took a big huge bite out of it. Sweet-looking juice dripped down from her hand onto the ground at her feet.\nWow . . . fruit!\nI went back home and got myself a lamb chop. After days of nothing but meat, I felt sick just looking at it, but hurried back to that spot again and, while Chaeeunshinji watched, I devoured the whole thing, and then licked my fingers clean afterward. Not because I actually enjoyed it, of course: I just wanted to see the look on Chaeeunshinji\u2019s face. But all I could see was those binoculars in front of her face, and so eventually I just went back home.\nThat evening, when I told my mom about the story, she tilted her head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s weird. They have to be dealing with the same kinds of stuff we are . . . what makes you think they\u2019re doing better than us?\u201d\n\u201cBut Eunshinji said they have a lot to eat over there.\u201d\n\u201cFor kids who hit puberty so long ago, you two sure are a pair of little brats. Think about it: what did you tell her? \u2018We\u2019ve got nothing to eat, can you share some of what you have with us?\u2019 Is that what you said?\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course, not!\u201d\n\u201cThere you go! You and Chaeeunshinji, you two punks are exactly the same: neither of you can stand to accept anything from the other, if it means giving up a little bit on winning. How in the world are you two going to turn out when you grow up?\u201d\nThe next day, I took a pork leg with me, and a solar-powered grill, and cooked it while Chaeeunshinji watched. I grilled up the leg and then I ate it, piece by piece, really, really slowly. I wasn\u2019t taking my time on purpose: I couldn\u2019t help it, because as much as I pretended that it was totally delicious, I really didn\u2019t want to eat it at all. Chaeeunshinji stared at me for more than an hour as I ate it, never once lowering her binoculars.\nFinally, it was Chaeeunshinji\u2019s turn. From a distance, it looked like she had half a ripe red watermelon with her, and she finally set down her binoculars and spent almost the whole next hour eating the thing, just as slowly as I\u2019d eaten my pork leg.\nI wrote a huge message on a page of my sketchbook and then held it up toward her so she could see it.\n\u2014SO WHAT? THAT\u2019S NOT EVEN MEAT, IT\u2019S JUST A STUPID WATERMELON.\nChaeeunshinji looked over through her binoculars for a second, but then she ignored me and went back to eating the watermelon with this arrogant look on her face. I sat there, gaping and dazzled. She looked so elegant, even when she was just spitting out watermelon seeds onto the ground. Finally, she finished eating her half-watermelon without breaking her absolutely perfect poise, with not a single thing out of place, from the way she sat, to the movements of her fingertips. Then, I guess feeling bloated, she lay down on the roof of the building.\nThat made me burst out laughing, and watching Chaeeunshinji closely through my binoculars, I could see her shoulders shaking. I swear I could almost hear her laughing then\u2014that familiar, distant sound of Eunshinji\u2019s chuckling suddenly just as close and clear as if she were sitting right next to me. Then I lay down on the ground too, and though we were far apart, it felt like we were laying down together, staring up into the same big sky above us, until we both drifted off into a nap.\nA couple of days later, the next supply ship came. This time, it was completely loaded with seafood.\n\u201cAre there any leaves, anything green?\u201d asked Mr. Dallu impatiently. \u201cMaybe some seaweed, even, dried or fresh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing like that. Just clams, squid, tuna, and stuff like that . . . some other kinds of fish.\u201d\nThat evening, they held a meeting at the research center auditorium. Many grown-ups, including Mr. Dallu, insisted that we ought to request evacuation, regardless of anything else.\n\u201cThink about the kids,\u201d someone said, and everyone turned and looked over at us. I put on a really sad face. When they saw me do that, some of the lady researchers giggled at me.\nBut the director just yelled at everyone, his face stern: \u201cI told you, we can never do that!\u201d Everyone just looked away when he did that, and he went on: \u201cFolks, let\u2019s just try to make it work a little longer. I\u2019ve already explained to you plenty of times why we need to hang in there. This planet hasn\u2019t even been fully explored yet! It\u2019s not ready to become anyone\u2019s territory yet! If we leave, other people will come here, to this spot. We have to keep up with them\u2014that other research team, I mean. They\u2019re not so different from us, are they? I\u2019m not even hoping they give up and leave, either: I just want both sides to see this through till the end.\u201d\nEveryone went silent, then, and suddenly seemed lost in thought.\nA moment later, though, Mr. Dallu broke the silence: \u201cWe are hanging in there. We all know exactly what you mean, it\u2019s just that we can\u2019t handle this anymore. You can\u2019t just tell us to hang in there and make do with what we have. We want to eat vegetables, leaves. We\u2019re not nomads, we\u2019re all going to get sick from vitamin deficiencies. If you don\u2019t think fainting is a problem, how about constipation? Have you thought about that? Nobody\u2019s saying anything now, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re all suffering from it.\u201d\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d said the director, \u201cBut even so, we can\u2019t give up now. Think about it. They must be suffering just as badly as we are, right? But they\u2019re handling it so well. If we give up first, then it makes everything they\u2019re suffering through amount to nothing, too, right? When you think about it that way, don\u2019t you think we owe it to them to try hold on just a little longer?\u201d\nAt that, everyone started talking, their voices growing louder and louder. I plugged my ears. Of course, that didn\u2019t block out everything, but I was lost in another thought, and suddenly I wasn\u2019t hearing or seeing anything around me anymore.\nThat is, until mom suddenly jumped to her feet and shouted so loudly that everyone heard her: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we trade?\u201d\nThen everyone turned and looked at Mom.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d blurted Mr. Dallu.\nMom replied, \u201cYou said they\u2019re basically like us, and that our goals are pretty much the same, right? Well, then we can just exchange food! Some of what they have, for some of what we have.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that would be wonderful,\u201d Mr. Dallu responded. \u201cBut you know that\u2019s not going to happen. Just look at how they\u2019ve been acting since the war started. They canceled all the joint research projects and even scrubbed the accumulated data. Look at me, even: when the war broke out, they were the ones who insisted I leave. It\u2019s not like we wanted any of that. They were the ones who first started acting like the war was between our two groups.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not the only ones, though. We did too,\u201d my mom countered \u201cLook at us. As soon as that attack ship showed up, we put a complete stop to all free movement here, didn\u2019t we? Even the shared facilities! We locked them up first, so that they couldn\u2019t use them, even though we weren\u2019t planning on using them at all either. We can\u2019t just pretend that none of that happened and try to go back to the way it was before.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t\u2014because it did happen. Obviously it happened. And now we can\u2019t go back to the way it was before.\u201d\nThe next morning, I got my binoculars and sketchbook and went over by the borderline again. Then I wrote a message to Chaeeunshinji:\n\u2013WE CAN TRADE FOOD. MY MOM SAID SO.\nChaeeunshinji wrote a response in her own sketchbook.\n\u2013DID I MAKE YOU JEALOUS? YOU WANT SOME FRUIT? BEG FOR IT. COME ON, SAY, PLEEEEEASE, BIG SIS.\n\u2013ARE YOU NUTS???\n\u2013YOU WANT SOME FRUIT? I DON\u2019T WANT MEAT SO BAD, SO I DON\u2019T WANNA TRADE, REALLY.\n\u2013WELL THEN NEITHER DO I.\nBut that day, we did end up trading some of our rations. Finally, for the first time in months, I got to see Chaeeunshinji up close.\n\u201cEunshinji, you look taller!\u201d\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019ve been eating so well.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re taller, but you\u2019re also so skinny. If you were eating so well, you\u2019d have put on some weight!\u201d\n\u201cShut up, you savage!\u201d\nI ended up trading some pork jowl for Chaeeunshinji\u2019s bell peppers and red chilies.\n\u201cWhat? Is that all you\u2019re giving me for this pork? Seriously? That\u2019s a terrible bargain. How can you think this amount of vegetables is worth the same as that much pork?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t want it, fine, I\u2019ll take it back. Like I said, I don\u2019t really like pork jowl anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh, just take it. Consider it a favor, just this once. But don\u2019t go starting rumors, okay? Our director might summon me to his office and give me hell for aiding and abetting our enemy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you better keep this to yourself, too . . . \u201d\nThat day at dinnertime, all the grown-ups were chewing their meat with this look on their faces like they were all just chewing mouthfuls of dirt. That is, until they saw me set out 4 green bell peppers and 6 chilies on the table in front of me.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d asked Mr. Dallu.\n\u201cA hostage exchange . . . \u201d\n\u201cIs that a token of love? Because if it is, I don\u2019t think I want to take it away from you.\u201d\n\u201cThink whatever you want.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t give up my peppers to anyone, not even Mom. It felt like everyone was peering sideways at me out of the corners of their eyes as I picked up one of the green peppers and broke it in half with a loud crunching sound, CRACK! Even though it wasn\u2019t really very loud at all, it filled the whole research center dining hall as if it were a booming echo.\nThen I split it into quarters, following the lines of that green bell pepper the way Chaeeunshinji had taught me. After that, I picked up a bit of meat and set it in the inner curve of the pepper piece. Compared to the pepper, the sliver of meat looked ridiculously tiny. When I was about to finally bring it up to my mouth, I remembered the slow, elegant way Chaeeunshinji had eaten on that afternoon when she\u2019d been showing off that half-watermelon of hers. Someplace close, someone\u2019s mouth was watering, and they gulped it down loudly.\nCRUNCH.\nAs I bit into the pepper, the sound split the air.\nCRUNCH.\nThe sound was so holy and glorious, it was like the sky was being ripped in two.\nCRRRUNNNCH.\nI was the only one chewing a green pepper there, but because of that sound, I could see how, in everyone else\u2019s heads, the dormant memory of the flavor and texture of peppers suddenly awoke, all at once.\nCRUNCH!\nCRUNCH!!\nCRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH!!!\nJust then, the director walked into the dining hall. As I looked over at him, I saw him notice the peppers and chilies in front of me. He instantly froze on the spot.\nCRRRRRUNCH!!!\nGulp.\nThe next morning, the entire research center held a big meeting. This time, it went way more smoothly than the last time.\n\u201cWe need to take the bull by the horns,\u201d said the director, and everyone nodded in agreement.\nNot long after, around lunchtime, we gathered out in the library yard. Almost everyone among the families living at the research center showed up, even the kids. It was the biggest gathering that had happened since the outbreak of the war.\n\u201cWe need to overwhelm them with our first attack. If it takes until the second, it might be a lot harder. We need to break their will to resist completely with a single, sudden assault. Got it? Right, then let\u2019s begin.\u201d\nThe grown-ups all took their positions, and then fired up their grills in unison. When they were all hot enough, they started setting down the first pieces of meat over the fire.\nSssssssssssssssssssss.\nThe air was filled with the sound of hot fat hissing; it sounded like falling rain. That was the signal, and then the sound of the grilling meat filled the air all at once, like the roar of a heavy downpour coming down.\nFrom a distance, Chaeeunshinji looked on, watching the scene unfold.\nThen other people on the other side of the borderline started appearing, one or two faces at a time.\nSssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss-ssssssshhhhhh.\nOf course, our most effective weapon wasn\u2019t the sound of the cooking meat\u2014it was the aroma.\nTheir enemy attack ship passed over our village a little earlier than usual. Within ten minutes, it seemed like nearly everyone in Chaeeunshinji\u2019s research center had appeared, their faces peering from the windows. For some reason, I started feeling kinda nervous.\nSsssssssssssssssssssss.\nThey began coming toward us, a step at a time. They were still far enough away that they couldn\u2019t have been hearing the sound of it yet, but that mouth-watering smell of grilling meat had definitely reached them. I wondered whether maybe last night, in her own group\u2019s dining hall, Chaeeunshinji might\u2019ve done the same thing that I\u2019d done at dinner. If she had, then the effect must have been even bigger than on our group, because after all she\u2019d done it with meat.\nWe\u2019d already set out our tables and chairs in the library yard. Of course, all we had to offer was meat, but we\u2019d brought out our good plates and utensils for them to use. Even from on their side of the line, they must\u2019ve seen all that, seen how we\u2019d set up the tables and chairs and utensils and everything\u2014more chairs than all the research center families together on our side could have needed\u2014and known what we were doing.\nStep by step, they came closer. Attracted by the smell. Attracted by the atmosphere, by how it felt like a party. A few of them had already crossed the borderline without even realizing it. As they crossed over it, I saw this look on their faces, like they were thinking, What are they up to? You could feel the tension in the air; it felt like a serious, important moment.\nBut just then, someone on their side said something, made some comment we couldn\u2019t quite make out. Everyone who was coming toward us suddenly stopped in their tracks.\nIt was their side\u2019s research director who\u2019d made the comment. Everyone on our side looked over at their, nobody daring to breathe. Then a few of them ran back toward their research center buildings. What in the world was going on? What had their director told them to do? The tension rose, like a string being pulled taut\u2014worry mixed with hope, and I worried if that string got cut, it might suddenly sag uselessly in the middle. The air became thick, as if something were about to happen.\nBut that tension didn\u2019t last very long. The people who\u2019d run back into their research center appeared again, and now they carrying stuff with them. Lots of stuff. Once a few of us saw what it was they were carrying, they relaxed, and like waves spreading through water, relief made its way through our group.\nThe sky above us was still loud, because their attack ship had come back around, once again earlier than usual. It was probably looking down at us, and seeing people crossing the borderline from their side, coming over to tables set up by us, the enemy\u2019s citizens, and carrying loads of bell peppers, chiles, lettuce, sesame leaves, and whatever.\nSo what?\nIn the end, the attack ship disappeared above us. The border had already been become meaningless. It seemed to us as if the war was already over.\nI took some of the fruit brought over from Chaeeunshinji\u2019s research center and ate it until I was stuffed. Meanwhile, Chaeeunshinji scooped up all kinds of meat that we\u2019d set out on the tables. It wasn\u2019t just the two of us, either: everyone did that. People lay out pieces of pork belly onto chunks of split green pepper, and you could tell who was from which group by the ratio of meat to vegetables in their hands. Here, from a piece of meat and some bell pepper together in each person\u2019s hand, a unimaginable miracle was about to happen.\nThe meat juices\u2014that juice that had always just flowed through your mouth along whatever way if could and slipped down your throat\u2014were elevated to a new level with they met the juices of those bright green vegetables. It was as if each became more completely itself\u2014the juices of the meat more perfectly meaty, the juices of the vegetables more perfectly vegetabley\u2014and I felt like at that point where they met and mingled together, they became some new kind of juice that deserved a unique, special name of its own, like some kind of rare subatomic particle created by a particle accelerator. And just then, when it felt perfectly complete and holy and glorious, that was when the miracle happened.\nWar is politics carried out by violence, but at the moment, the shape of warfare was simpler to trace. The stomach commands! The tongue leads! You don\u2019t even need a weapon: once you put the food in your mouth, that\u2019s it, nothing else matters anymore.\nAnd with that, we all agreed to strike a truce.\nNow, nobody ever said the word \u201ctruce.\u201d The agreement wasn\u2019t made outside our mouths, but instead inside them. That was a more sacred oath, one that would endure far longer than any agreement written down on paper.\n\u201cQuit stuffing yourself, elephant boy!\u201d snapped Chaeeunshinji, as if she were spoiling for an squabble.\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing it too!\u201d I snapped back. \u201cYou\u2019re eating exactly like those, uh, I mean, exactly like this.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t even talk right, dork!\u201d\nAnd with that, the war was over and my eternal fight with Chaeeunshinji was back on again. It continued, too, endlessly, but at least within the atmosphere of GreenScallion, we never again had anything like that wartime borderline that, invisible to everyone, had kept people apart.\nOur two planets, with their different rotational and sidereal periods, eventually declared an armistice, but long before they\u2019d gotten around to that, we\u2019d already ended the war.\nThat\u2019s how the planet of GreenScallion managed to reach the end of the war without either homeworld\u2019s population climbing over 80% of the world\u2019s total population. Which also meant that the planet was a place where nobody could stake a claim to ownership, so the world was able to remain open to any visitor who might want to come there, including all humans but also members of any other species that might feel like coming there. Of course, I don\u2019t actually remember anyone coming and visiting at the time\u2014or even after the war, for that matter\u2014but anyway, according to the director, that was how things stood legally.\nTime passed, enough time so we finally got to the day when all the kids on the planet were grown up and leaving their families to go to where their universities were located, where the big cities were. As it turned out, Chaeeunshinji and I were headed for the same place.\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so embarrassed, so embarrassed,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t even say a word to anyone. I can\u2019t even stand up straight . . . \u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you so embarrassed about?\u201d I asked her.\n\u201cLook, how old am I? I\u2019m your big sister, by a lot, but I\u2019m still going to show up there with a little punk like you by my side! What an embarrassment! It\u2019s the most shameful day of my life! What a massive, complete embarrassment! This is why people shouldn\u2019t stay too long in the same little neighborhood . . . they shove everyone who looks remotely similar into the same classroom, regardless of their age or education. That\u2019s how someone as talented as me ends up being dragged down into mediocrity. Argh, what the hell? What a completely cosmic-scale waste!\u201d\nMom had done up Chaeeunshinji\u2019s hair with her special, zero-gravity hairstyle, and even given her a special discount as a congratulatory present because she was going to university.\nMy mom had said, \u201cYou guys were so little back then that you don\u2019t actually remember living in zero-g, right? If you go on a spaceship looking like that, you\u2019re going to hear people calling you bumpkins, believe me. Now that you\u2019re a young woman, Shinji, you need to start dressing like it. Being pretty down on the ground and being pretty out in space are two totally different things. If you stick to this kind of hairstyle, when you go up there, your hair\u2019s going to stick out all over, it\u2019s going to look ridiculous. And you can\u2019t just keep it tied back, right? Wow, it\u2019s been a long time. Finally, I get to show someone what I can really do! Wow, look at your hair! It\u2019s so nice! You\u2019re so young, and it\u2019s spring . . . spring . . . \u201d\nAfter saying goodbye to my family, I headed for the spaceship. It wasn\u2019t long after that we flew up and up, until GreenScallion\u2019s gravity no longer had any hold on us.\nAs Chaeeunshinji was unbuckling her harness and getting up from her seat, she said to me, \u201cLet\u2019s go check out the dining hall.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, are you hungry already?\u201d\n\u201cNah, not hungry, exactly. I\u2019m just curious about the d\u00e9cor.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s silly,\u201d I said.\nEunshinji hovered in the spaceship hallway, hanging onto one of the many railings that was attached to every surface. She floated before me, and in the absence of gravity, her hair stuck out in every direction. Suddenly, she turned and looked back toward me as if some idea had just occurred to her. As she turned, her long hair was swept along, following the movement of her head. Then, it slowly spread out again into the air, spreading back out into the air. It wasn\u2019t like how hair acts when it\u2019s being blown by the wind; it spread out toward every direction at once, like it was doing some kind of light and joyful dance\u2014as if the hair itself were alive, and planning to fly away suddenly.\n\u201cWow!\u201d I said.\nFrom the look she gave me, I realized that I was gaping at her in amazement.\n\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Chaeeunshinji said. \u201cShut your mouth, before you get dust in there. You look ridiculous! Are you trying to look like an outer world bumpkin?\u201d\n\u201cY\u2019know what, Eunshinji?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMy Mom, I, uh, I think she\u2019s actually a real professional hairstylist.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Uh, I mean . . . \u201d\nAt that moment, I was looking at the most elegant, beautiful girl in the whole universe, and I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same Chaeeunshinji I\u2019d met a million times before, and she was hovering in the air right there in in front of me, hanging onto that hallway railing while looking into my two eyes with that bright, mischievous smile of hers.\nThat\u2019s how I met Chaeeunshinji.\nAnd once again, Chaeeunshinji swept into my heart.\nOriginally published in Korean in Hoyeon Pimang: Pimang Danpyeon Seon, edited by Bo-Young Kim.\nPublished with the support of Literature Translation Institute of Korea (LTI Korea).\nBae Myung-hoon was the 2005 winner South Korea's Science and Technology Creative Award in 2005.

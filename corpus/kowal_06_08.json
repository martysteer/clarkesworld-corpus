But she did not mind. She pecked the floor when she was wound, looking for invisible bugs. And when she was not wound, she cocked her head and glared at the sparrow, whom she loathed with every tooth on every gear in her pressed-tin body.\n The sparrow could fly.\n He took no pains to conceal his contempt for those who could not. When his mechanism spun him around and around overhead, he twittered\u2014not even a proper song\u2014to call attention to his flight. Chickadee kept her head down when she could so as not to give him the satisfaction of her notice. It was clear to her that any bird could fly if only they were attached to a string like him. The flight, of which he was so proud, was not even an integral part of his clockwork. A wind-up engine hanging from the chandelier spun him in circles while he merely flapped his wings. Chickadee could do as much. And so she thought until she hatched an idea to show that Sparrow was not so very special.\n It happened, one day, that Chickadee and Sparrow were shelved next to one another.\n Sparrow, who lay tilted on his belly as his feet were only painted on, said, \u201cHow limiting the view is from here. Why, when I am flying I can see everything.\u201d\n \u201cNot everything, I\u2019ll warrant,\u201d said Chickadee. \u201cHave you seen what is written underneath the table? Do you know how the silver marble got behind the potted fern, or where the missing wind-up key is?\u201d\n Sparrow flicked his wing at her. \u201cWhy should I care about such things when I can see the ceiling above and the plaster cherubs upon it. I can see the shelves below us and the mechanical menagerie upon it, even including the clockwork scarab and his lotus. I can see the fireplace, which shares the wall with us, none of which are visible from here nor to you.\u201d\n \u201cBut I have seen all of these things as I have been carried to and from the shelf. In addition the boy has played with me at the fountain outside.\u201d\n \u201cWhat fountain?\u201d\n \u201cAh! Can you not see the courtyard fountain when you fly?\u201d Chickadee hopped a step closer to him. \u201cSuch a pity.\u201d\n \u201cBah\u2014Why should I care about any of this?\u201d\n \u201cFor no reason today,\u201d said Chickadee. \u201cPerhaps tomorrow.\u201d\n \u201cWhat is written underneath the table?\u201d Sparrow called as he swung in his orbit about the room, wings clicking against his side with each downstroke.\n Chickadee pecked at the floor and shifted a cog to change her direction toward the table. \u201cThe address of Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski.\u201d\n \u201cBah. Why should I care about them?\u201d\n \u201cBecause they are master clockworkers. They can re-set cogs to create movements you would not think possible.\u201d\n \u201cI have all the movement I need. They can offer me nothing.\u201d\n \u201cYou might change your mind.\u201d Chickadee passed under the edge of the table. \u201cPerhaps tomorrow.\u201d\n Above the table, Sparrow\u2019s gears ground audibly in frustration.\n Chickadee cocked her head to look up at the yellow slip of paper glued to the underside if the table. Its type was still crisp though the paper itself threatened to peel away. She scanned the corners of the room for movement. In the shadows by the fireplace, a live mouse caught her gaze. He winked.\n \u201cHow did the silver marble get behind the potted fern?\u201d Sparrow asked as he lay on the shelf.\n \u201cIt fell out of the boy\u2019s game and rolled across the floor to where I was pecking the ground. I waited but no one seemed to notice that it was gone, nor did they notice me, so I put my beak against it and pushed it behind the potted fern.\u201d\n \u201cYou did? You stole from the boy?\u201d Sparrow clicked his wings shut. \u201cI find that hard to believe.\u201d\n \u201cYou may not, today,\u201d Chickadee said. \u201cPerhaps tomorrow.\u201d\n She cocked her head to look away from him and to the corner where the live mouse now hid. The mouse put his forepaw on the silver marble and rolled it away from the potted fern. Chickadee felt the tension in her spring and tried to calculate how many revolutions of movement it still offered her. She thought it would suffice.\n \u201cWhere is the missing wind-up key?\u201d Sparrow hung from his line, waiting for the boy to wind him again.\n \u201cThe live mouse has it.\u201d Chickadee hopped forward and pecked at another invisible crumb, but did not waste the movement needed to look at Sparrow.\n \u201cWhat would a live mouse need with a windup key?\u201d\n \u201cHe does not need it,\u201d said Chickadee. \u201cBut I do have need of it and he is in my service.\u201d\n All the gears in the room stopped for a moment as the other clockwork animals paused to listen. Even the nightingale stopped her song. In the sudden cessation of ticking, sound from the greater world outside crept in, bringing the babble of the fountain in the courtyard, the laughter of the boy, the purr of automobiles and from the far distance, the faint pealing of a clock.\n \u201cI suppose you would have us believe that he winds you?\u201d said Sparrow.\n \u201cNot yet. Perhaps today.\u201d She continued pecking the floor.\n After a moment of nothing happening, the other animals returned to their tasks save for the sparrow. He hung from his line and beat his wings against his side.\n \u201cHa! I see him. I see the live mouse behind the potted fern. You could too if you could fly.\u201d\n \u201cI have no need.\u201d Chickadee felt her clockwork beginning to slow. \u201cLive Mouse!\u201d she called. \u201cIt is time to fulfill our bargain.\u201d\n The silence came again as the other animals stopped to listen. Into this quiet came a peculiar scraping rattle and then the live mouse emerged from behind the potted fern with the missing wind-up key tied in his tail.\n \u201cWhat is he doing?\u201d Sparrow squawked.\n Chickadee bent to peck the ground so slowly she thought she might never touch it. A gear clicked forward and she tapped the floor. \u201cDo you really need me to tell you that?\u201d\n Above her, Sparrow dangled on his line. \u201cLive Mouse! Whatever she has promised you, I can give you also, only wind my flying mechanism.\u201d\n The live mouse twirled his whiskers and kept walking toward Chickadee. \u201cWell now. That\u2019s a real interesting proposition. How about a silver marble?\u201d\n \u201cThere is one behind the potted fern.\u201d\n \u201cNot nomore.\u201d\n \u201cThen a crystal from the chandelier.\u201d\n The live mouse wrinkled his nose. \u201cIf\u2019n I can climb the chandelier to wind ya, then I reckon I can reach a crystal for myself.\u201d\n \u201cI must have something you want.\u201d\n With the key paused by Chickadee\u2019s side, the live mouse said, \u201cThat might be so.\u201d\n The live mouse set the tip of the key down like a cane and folded his paws over it. Settling back on his haunches, he tipped his head up to study Sparrow. \u201cHow \u2019bout, you give me one of your wings?\u201d\n Sparrow squawked.\n \u201cYou ain\u2019t got no need of \u2019em to fly, that right?\u201d The live mouse looked down and idly twisted the key on the floor, as if he were winding the room. \u201cProbly make you spin round faster, like one of them zeppelin thingamabobs. Whazzat called? Air-o-dye-namic.\u201d\n \u201cA bird cannot fly without wings.\u201d\n \u201cNow you and I both know that ain\u2019t so. A live bird can\u2019t fly without wings, but you\u2019re a clockwork bird.\u201d\n \u201cWhat would a live mouse know about clockworks?\u201d\n The live mouse laughed. \u201cAin\u2019t you never heard of Hickory, Dickory and Dock? We mice have a long history with clockworks. Looking at you, I figure you won\u2019t miss a wing none and without it dragging, you ought to be able to go faster and your windings would last you longer. Whaddya say? Wouldn\u2019t it be a mite sight nicer to fly without having to wait for the boy to come back?\u201d\n \u201cWhat would you do with my wing?\u201d\n \u201cThat,\u201d the live mouse smiled, showing his sharp incisors, \u201cis between me and Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski. So do we have a deal?\u201d\n \u201cI will have to consider the matter.\u201d\n \u201cSuit yourself.\u201d The live mouse lifted the key and put the tip in Chickadee\u2019s winding mechanism.\n \u201cWait!\u201d Sparrow flicked his wings as if anxious to be rid of them. \u201cYes, yes you may have my left wing, only wind me now. A bird is meant to fly.\u201d\n \u201cAll righty, then.\u201d\n Chickadee turned her head with painful slowness. \u201cNow, Live Mouse, you and I have an agreement.\u201d\n \u201cThat we did and we do, but nothing in it says I can\u2019t have another master.\u201d\n \u201cThat may well be, but the wind-up key belongs to me.\u201d\n \u201cI reckon that\u2019s true. Sorry, Sparrow. Looks as if I can\u2019t help you none.\u201d The live mouse sighed. \u201cAnd I surely did want me one of them wings.\u201d\n Once again, he lifted the key to Chickadee\u2019s side. Above them, Sparrow let out a squeal of metal. \u201cWait! Chickadee, there must be something I can offer you. You are going on a journey, yes? From here, I can tell you if any dangers lie on your route.\u201d\n \u201cOnly in this room and we are leaving it.\u201d\n \u201cLeaving? And taking the key with you?\u201d\n \u201cJust so. Do not worry. The boy will come to wind you eventually. And now, Live Mouse, if you would be so kind.\u201d\n \u201cMy other wing! You may have my other wing, only let the live mouse use the key to wind me.\u201d\n Chickadee paused, waiting for her gears to click forward so that she could look at the Sparrow. Her spring was so loose now, that each action took an eternity. \u201cWhat would I do with one of your wings? I have two of my own.\u201d\n The other clockwork bird seemed baffled and hung on the end of the line flapping his wings as if he could fling them off.\n The live mouse scraped a claw across the edge of the key. \u201cIt might come in real handy on our trip. Supposing Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski want a higher payment than you\u2019re thinking they do. Why then you\u2019d have something more to offer them.\u201d\n \u201cAnd if they didn\u2019t then we would have carried the wing with us for no reason.\u201d\n \u201cNow as to that,\u201d said the live mouse, \u201cI can promise you that I\u2019ll take it off your hands if\u2019n we don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n Chickadee laughed. \u201cOh, Live Mouse, I see now. Very well, I will accept Sparrow\u2019s wing so that later you may have a full set. Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski will be happy to have two customers, I am certain.\u201d\n The live mouse bowed to her and wrapped the key in his tail again. \u201cSparrow, I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d Scampering across the floor, he disappeared into the wall.\n Chickadee did not watch him go, she waited with her gaze still cocked upward toward Sparrow. With the live mouse gone, Chickadee became aware of how still the other clockworks were, watching their drama. Into the silence, Nightingale began to cautiously sing. Her beautiful warbles and chirps repeated through their song thrice before the live mouse appeared out of the ceiling on the chandelier\u2019s chain. The crystals of the chandelier tinkled in a wild accompaniment to the ordered song of the nightingale.\n The live mouse shimmied down the layers of crystals until he reached Sparrow\u2019s flying mechanism. Crawling over that, he wrapped his paws around the string beneath it and slid down to sit on Sparrow\u2019s back.\n \u201cFirst one\u2019s for me.\u201d His sharp incisors flashed in the chandelier\u2019s light as he pried the tin loops up from the left wing. Tumbling free, it half fell, half floated to rattle against the floor below. \u201cAnd now this is for the chickadee.\u201d\n Again, his incisors pulled the tin free and let the second wing drop.\n Sparrow\u2019s clockwork whirred audibly inside his body, with nothing to power. \u201cI feel so light!\u201d\n \u201cTold ya so.\u201d The live mouse reached up and took the string in his paws. Hauling himself back up the line, he reached the flying mechanism in no time at all. \u201cReady now?\u201d\n \u201cYes! Oh yes, wind me! Wind me!\u201d\n Lickety-split, the key sank into the winding mechanism and the live mouse began turning it. The sweet familiar sound of a spring ratcheting tighter floated down from above, filling the room. The other clockwork animals crept closer; even Chickadee felt the longing brought on by the sound of winding.\n When the live mouse stopped, Sparrow said, \u201cNo, no, I am not wound nearly tight enough yet.\u201d\n The live mouse braced himself with his tail around an arm of the chandelier and grunted as he turn the key again. And again. And again. \u201cEnough?\u201d\n \u201cTighter.\u201d\n He kept winding.\n \u201cEnough?\u201d\n \u201cTighter. The boy never winds me fully.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d The mouse turned the key three more times and stopped. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Key won\u2019t turn no more.\u201d\n A strange vibration ran through the sparrow\u2019s body. It took Chickadee a moment to realize that he was trying to beat his wings with anticipation. \u201cThen watch me fly.\u201d\n The live mouse pulled the key out of the flying mechanism and hopped up onto the chandelier. As he did, Sparrow swung into action. The flying mechanism whipped him forward and he shrieked with glee. His body was a blur against the ceiling. The chandelier trembled, then shook, then rattled as he spun faster than Chickadee had ever seen him.\n \u201cLive Mouse, you were rig\u2014\u201d With a snap, his flying mechanism broke free of the chandelier. \u201cI\u2019m flying!\u201d Sparrow cried as he hurtled across the room. His body crashed into the window, shattering a pane as he flew through it.\n The nightingale stopped her song in shock. Outside, the boy shrieked and his familiar footsteps hurried under the window. \u201cOh pooh. The clockwork sparrow is broken.\u201d\n The mother\u2019s voice said, \u201cLeave it alone. There\u2019s glass everywhere.\u201d\n Overhead, the live mouse looked down and winked.\n Chickadee pecked the ground, with her mechanism wound properly. The live mouse appeared at her side. \u201cThanks for the wings.\u201d\n \u201cI trust they are satisfactory payment?\u201d\n \u201cSure enough. They look real pretty hanging on my wall.\u201d He squinted at her. \u201cSo that\u2019s it? You\u2019re just going to keep on pecking the ground?\u201d\n \u201cAs long as you keep winding me.\u201d\n \u201cYeah. It\u2019s funny, no one else wants my services.\u201d\n \u201cA pity.\u201d\n \u201cGot a question for you though. Will you tell me how to get to Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski?\u201d\n \u201cWhy ever for?\u201d\n \u201cWell, I thought . . . I thought maybe Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski really could, I dunno, fix \u2019em on me so as I can fly.\u201d\n Chickadee rapped the ground with laughter. \u201cNo, Mouse, they cannot. We are all bound to our integral mechanisms.\u201d She cocked her head at him. \u201cYou are a live mouse. I am a clockwork chickadee, and Messrs DeCola and Wodzinski are nothing more than names on a scrap of paper glued to the bottom of a table.\u201d\n Mary Robinette Kowal is a professional puppeteer who moonlights as a writer.

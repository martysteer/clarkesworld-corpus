I\u2019m lacing my shoes in the hallway when I hear the tap-tap-tap of her heels. I freeze for a moment, then rise to meet her.\n Mom stands in the door, elegant in a simple dress. No matter the silvery hair. No matter how her skin, once a smooth dark brown, wrinkles over her bones. You\u2019d never guess she has lived a century. She has no titanium knees, no vat-grown veins, no concession to modernity inside her.\n If only her mind were as strong.\n \u201cMom.\u201d I smile at her.\n \u201cRico.\u201d She smiles too, uncertainly. \u201cMust you go?\u201d\n \u201cJust for a minute.\u201d\n Her breath catches. She reaches for me with one trembling hand. Halts when I wince. Her fingers linger mid-air, gnarled and stained with ink.\n She\u2019s been drawing in her upstairs studio. She\u2019s been drawing with the door locked, her work a secret to the world and her agent and me.\n I haven\u2019t pried. What might I find, if I opened her sketchbook\u2014scribbles, blotches, scrawls? Proof that her time is up?\n Ashamed of the thought, I take Mom\u2019s hand\u2014bony and warm and strong. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\n She steps close and presses her face into my chest. Her shoulders tremble. I feel her tears soaking through my shirt.\n \u201cLo siento, Rico,\u201d she whispers.\n Every time Mom says goodbye to someone, it\u2019s for the last time. She thinks\u2014no, she knows\u2014that she\u2019ll never see them again. Not the mailman. Not her best friend Abby. Not me.\n It\u2019s no tumor, no disease\u2014we\u2019ve run all the tests. Her reasoning is strong as ever. She can tell you how the milkshakes tasted in Miramar, before Fidel came down from the mountains and she left on the Peter Pan airlift. But deep within her mind, something has begun to fail.\n And I can\u2019t fix it.\n So I pat her back and murmur reassurances in her ear, and try not to think what she\u2019s feeling. Try not to imagine how I would feel, if I knew that I\u2019d never see her again in my life.\n This happens every day.\n Still I delay what I must do.\n \u201cJust build the habitat. You\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\n Lisa packs shirt after lopsided shirt into her green Samsonite. After three decades of marriage, the sight is comforting. Lisa\u2019s only happy when in motion. Even her business suit has a space age streamlined look, the collar chic-asymmetric.\n \u201cIt seems too . . . permanent,\u201d I say. \u201cLike I\u2019m giving up on her.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s hard, I know. But what if she strokes tomorrow?\u201d\n Lisa\u2019s right, of course. The habitat\u2019s a contingency. I won\u2019t have to use it until it\u2019s that or the crematorium.\n But can I watch Mom suffer day after day, once there\u2019s an alternative?\n \u201cYou\u2019re giving her a gift,\u201d Lisa says. \u201cYou of all people should know that.\u201d\n Me of all people.\n I walk to the viewport in the north wall. It sits mounted in a steel band like a ship\u2019s porthole. Below it, a brass plate reads \u201cGeorge Dieter\u2014Captain, Husband, Father. 1960-2049.\u201d\n Dust covers the screen. Has it been that long? I reach up to wipe it clean.\n Blackness flickers into life.\n A turquoise sea laps against a stretch of sand. The beach glares blinding white, studded with regal palms. Beautiful.\n I could grab my immersion headset, feel the heat of the sun, hear the breeze coming off the water. But then I\u2019d have to face the man on the sand.\n He lies in the shade of a thatched beach umbrella. Perhaps thirty, his body lean and muscular, tanned bronze. Arms stretched out at his sides, eyes closed, face relaxed.\n George Dieter. First habitat upload in the world.\n \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d I whisper.\n It\u2019s been long since I said those words. Long since I descended into the world Lisa and I built two decades ago. I miss Dad\u2014it\u2019s not that. But every time I went to see him, I didn\u2019t find the man I was looking for.\n \u201cMom\u2019s drawing again,\u201d I tell Lisa. \u201cShe won\u2019t, after.\u201d\n I offered to give Dad a ship, after he uploaded. I offered to give him virtual seas to sail, cargo to carry, battles to fight. He only told me, \u201cI\u2019m tired, son.\u201d\n I learned that lesson well, those early years before our IPO. Maybe it\u2019s the lack of biochemical stimuli, maybe it\u2019s a shortcoming in the iterative neural matrices\u2014uploads just don\u2019t care.\n Lisa zips her suitcase and comes to me. She slides between me and the viewport, wraps her arms around me. \u201cCome with me to LA. Emily and I, we\u2019ve got miracles to show you. There are breakthroughs coming down the pipe that\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBreakthroughs?\u201d I pull back without meaning to. \u201cEvery month, heck, every week we get some breakthrough. We all rush to try it and blog it and show it off. Aren\u2019t you scared we\u2019re losing our humanity?\u201d\n \u201cOh, but we\u2019re not human anymore! We\u2019ve fragmented into a thousand different species. With every new technology we choose to adopt\u2014or not\u2014there are more of us.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re spouting Emily again.\u201d\n Lisa turns away, goes back to her suitcase. \u201cShe\u2019s a brilliant woman.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s our competitor.\u201d\n \u201cShould we miss out on a chance to change the world again, just because Emily works for the wrong corporation?\u201d\n On the screen, Dad gets up on his elbows and watches someone approach. A lithe figure and beautiful, strikingly dark against the white sand. A simulacrum of Mom as she once was. The thing can\u2019t even hold a conversation, but Dad doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He reaches out a lazy hand and grasps her, and draws her down atop him.\n The screen blurs.\n I turn away. \u201cI never wanted to change the world. I wanted to preserve it.\u201d\n Lisa seems not to have heard. \u201cI\u2019ll call you from LA.\u201d She wheels her suitcase to the door.\n Before she can open it, a knock comes. We jump, both of us. \u201cCome in,\u201d I call.\n Mom enters. \u201cRico, I\u2014\u201d She sees Lisa. \u201cI . . . I thought you left already, dear.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Alina.\u201d Lisa keeps her gaze on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m running late.\u201d\n As Lisa walks past, Mom parts her lips in a silent cry. She reaches for Lisa\u2019s shoulder. Pulls back as if scalded.\n Just like that, Mom lets Lisa go.\n I watch the tear that rolls down her cheek. I watch it, my eyes dry as they have ever been. I envy her.\n I\u2019m a coward that night. But the next day I call Mom from work.\n \u201cMom.\u201d\n A faint draw of breath in my cochlear. \u201cRico.\u201d Pause. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called.\u201d\n I wait for more, but nothing comes.\n \u201cMom, I\u2019ve been thinking. Your house in Miramar. The one with the grand patio and those big old doors. What color were those doors?\u201d\n Silence. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d\n \u201cYou showed me those photos a thousand times. I close my eyes, and I see that house. But I got to thinking I never knew the colors.\u201d When Mom says nothing, I add, \u201cThat\u2019s the place you were happiest, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re building me one of your things.\u201d\n Your things. That\u2019s all she calls the habitats, ever since she saw what Lisa and I created for Dad.\n \u201cMust you do that?\u201d she asks me.\n I press my face against the window, look across Northwest Portland to home. The tiles of our roof shine red amidst the trees of Nob Hill. I imagine Mom on the veranda, the question in her eyes.\n \u201cWe need to prepare,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBefore you . . . Before it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n \u201c . . . okay.\u201d\n \u201cOkay? Really, you\u2019re fine with this?\u201d\n \u201cThis has nothing to do with me,\u201d she says.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you, Mom.\u201d The words come out hard and fast. \u201cDoes that make me a bad person?\u201d\n \u201cThe doors were green,\u201d she says, after a while. \u201cGreen like bananas not yet ripe. We had the greenest doors in all of Miramar. They stood out from blocks away. On the last day, when my father drove me to the airport . . . I looked back at the end of the street and saw only a glimpse of green. I knew that I\u2019d never see those doors again.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll see them again.\u201d\n I stand there by the window, listening to Mom breathe. Waiting for some answer, question, request. Anything to let me believe this is an actual dialogue, a real conversation between two human beings.\n \u201cRico?\u201d she asks at last.\n \u201cYes, Mom?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t hang up.\u201d Her voice catches. \u201cStay on the line for a while, will you?\u201d\n I do. For a while.\n I go home late\u2014late enough to be sure Mom\u2019s asleep. Lisa calls as I close the door behind me.\n \u201cRico!\u201d she chirps in my cochlear. \u201cCheck the mail.\u201d\n I scan the shelf by the door. A cardboard box. I recognize Lisa\u2019s cursive on the label. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n \u201cSomething Emily and I cooked up.\u201d\n Emily again? I tear open the box and extract an immersion headset\u2014a thin gray headband, with the initials LE etched on the outside. \u201cTonight\u2019s a bad time for toys, Lisa.\u201d\n \u201cPut it on. Trust me, honey.\u201d I can hear her smile. \u201cJust get yourself comfortable first.\u201d\n Perplexed, I move into the living room and sink into my reading chair. A heavy leather recliner, it\u2019s the only piece of furniture in the whole house older than a decade. I had to fight Lisa to keep it when we moved up to Portland.\n I put on the headset. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n \u201cMeet you there!\u201d\n One by one my senses disconnect. The world quiets. I can\u2019t feel the leather under my fingers. I notice the faint scent of Stumptown Organic\u2014Mom\u2019s favorite coffee\u2014just as it evaporates. Black falls across my vision.\n Then, immersion.\n Warmth envelops me.\n My toes curl on cool glass.\n Nighttime. I look out over a golden city. Ten thousand towers lit up bright, far below. New York revolves stately around me.\n No, it\u2019s not New York that revolves, but I. A glass box of a room surrounds me, suspended at the end of a lever from the top of the Chrysler Building. The lever turns, and the streets of Manhattan float past below.\n My breath comes fast. Dizzy, I brace myself against the glass wall.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a Bocelli design.\u201d\n Lisa stands behind me, at the side of a gigantic mahogany bed covered in white satin. She too wears white\u2014sheer silk pajamas that cling to her skin. Her perfume caresses me delicately.\n I struggle to resist, but I feel myself stiffening inside my own pajamas. This place . . . I note the clear glass shower booth in the corner. The mirror centered in the ceiling.\n \u201cReally, Lisa? You know I don\u2019t go for this stuff.\u201d We tried immersion sex, early in our marriage. It never felt any better than dream sex\u2014than mental masturbation.\n \u201cThis is different,\u201d Lisa says. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit on something.\u201d\n She gestures, a flick of her wrist. Her clothes melt away, as do mine. She stands before me naked and beautiful\u2014and real, so very real. No glorified avatar, this. I see the stretch marks on her thighs, the slight flab of fat on her midriff, the wine-stain birthmark on her left breast.\n She smiles, a slight upturn of her lips.\n Blood pounds in my ears. I\u2019m hard as I\u2019ve ever been, the brush of cool air tantalizing against my skin.\n \u201cSo you got modeled for textures,\u201d I manage to force out. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d Lisa steps forward, reaches for my cheek. \u201cThis is me, Rico. Genetically. Chemically. Truly.\u201d\n Her fingers make contact.\n There\u2019s no faking her touch. No faking the bolt of electricity down my spine.\n I embrace her. Pull her close, shivering at the wonder of her skin against mine.\n We fall onto the bed and cling tight to each other. My body recognizes the whole of her pressed against me\u2014her heat, her scent, her strength, and so much more.\n With a hunger I\u2019d forgotten I possessed, I slide into her. She arches against me. We gasp as one and slip into an urgent beat. I kiss her lips, kiss her nose, kiss her sweat-slick brow as we climb the slope to climax. She smiles at me and cries out my name.\n When the end comes, some wonderful minutes later, I convulse against her and think\u2014this is better, this is better, this is better than the real thing . . .\n After, I lie on my back, her hand in mine, and listen to my heart calm its beat. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put this in our habitats.\u201d What if Dad could feel this real? What if Mom could? Might it make a difference?\n \u201cI\u2019ve already started negotiations. Emily\u2019s offering us a joint venture.\u201d\n \u201cOh. That\u2019s great.\u201d I pause, uncertain. \u201cLisa? I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\n She smiles. \u201cMe too, Rico. I want to be there for you. With this new tech, we can see a lot more of each other.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\n \u201cYou should hear what Emily\u2019s got in mind,\u201d she says. \u201cOnce you\u2019re capturing genetic makeup, it\u2019s a single step to information transfer. Immersion induced pregnancy.\u201d\n \u201c . . . pregnancy?\u201d\n \u201cProcreation is the only limit to our fragmentation as a species,\u201d Lisa says. \u201cBut procreation is just information exchange. Theoretically, I could mate with a piece of software.\u201d\n I gape at her.\n Lisa pats my cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t. Not with a stud like you around. Now I\u2019ve got to go. Say hi to your mother from me, will you?\u201d\n Before I can answer, she disappears.\n The living room snaps into reality around me as my teeth click together.\n Lisa\u2019s voice reverberates inside my skull. Can you imagine . . . ?\n I sit there alone, covered in sweat. Somewhere in the house, a clock ticks the seconds away. Cold sperm dries on my leg.\n \u201c . . . it\u2019s like she sees another person in me.\u201d I pick at my omelet. \u201cLike we disagree on who I am.\u201d\n Mom sips coffee and draws in a sketch pad with her free hand. She glances up at me once in a while. Hers is an artist\u2019s gaze, all-encompassing.\n She used to draw me every morning, while I ate before school. The price of my breakfast, she called it. I pretended to mind, but I kept all the drawings. A thousand penciled sketches of a teenager slurping down rice and beans.\n That was long ago. Today, it feels right that Mom should draw me. I need her to look at me. I need her to see me as I am and reassure me.\n She only says, \u201cYour father gave me black soles.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n \u201cI saw the home you built for him. The beach. The palms.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s what he asked for.\u201d\n \u201cI saw the girl,\u201d Mom says. \u201cHe asked for her too?\u201d\n \u201cDad didn\u2019t want to be without you. You can have a companion too, in your habitat.\u201d\n Mom stops drawing. \u201cWhy would I want that?\u201d\n \u201cI thought . . . you loved Dad, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve said my goodbyes,\u201d Mom says, \u201ceven if he hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n Mom sets her pen aside. \u201cGeorge was a good man. He loved me well. But understand, Rico\u2014I was more than a woman to him.\u201d\n \u201cYou were the love of his life.\u201d\n \u201cYes. The black love of his life.\u201d\n \u201cMom, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI left Havana in \u201962. Two hundred miles between Miramar and Miami. You know what else was two hundred miles? The distance between a Cuban and a nigger.\u201d\n Mom speaks the word nonchalantly, without anger, but I flinch even so. \u201cDad . . . did he . . . I mean, he never called you . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d Mom says. \u201cYour father gave up three jobs over me. He fought big men for me. Once he got stabbed for me. So what if he wanted me to meet all his Waspy friends? So what if he wanted the whole world to know I was his? I loved him, and thought he loved me.\u201d\n \u201cDidn\u2019t he?\u201d\n \u201cSo he told me. He always told me sweet things.\u201d Mom smiles. \u201cOne day he said I was God\u2019s only perfect creation.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sure he meant it.\u201d\n \u201cA few days later, we were messing around by the pool. He grabbed my foot and held it up. \u2018Here!\u2019 he shouted. \u2018Proof that God screws up!\u2019\u201d Mom gestures grandly, the motion eerily evocative of Dad. \u201cI was beautiful and perfect to him\u2014except for the pale undersides of my feet. Like God poured a bucket of brown paint over my head, and forgot about my soles.\u201d\n \u201cHe was joking.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen the girl he\u2019s got, on the beach you gave him. The girl who looks like me. I\u2019ve seen her soles.\u201d\n Could it be? I rack my memory. Did Dad tell me what to do? I wouldn\u2019t have made a mistake like that, would I?\n \u201cDon\u2019t glare like I\u2019ve spit on his grave,\u201d Mom says. \u201cGeorge loved me. I know that. Just as I know that Lisa loves you, even if she sees a man in you that you don\u2019t always recognize. Our lovers are never the people we love, not exactly.\u201d\n It happens a week later, as I\u2019m leaving for a client dinner.\n Mom catches me in the hallway and wraps me in her embrace, and weeps on my shoulder. She clutches her sketchbook in one hand. Its edge digs sharply into my ribs.\n I pat her back and murmur assurances, thinking ahead to the evening\u2019s negotiations. Then Mom twitches and gasps, and collapses.\n For some moments I stare at her. I\u2019m shocked, and surprised that I\u2019m shocked at this most expected of events. Then I start CPR and dial the office. Within minutes we\u2019re in an ambulance, screaming across Portland. An oxygen mask on Mom\u2019s face, her sketchbook still locked in her grasp.\n Severe heart attack, my team tells me. No repairing the damage.\n They rush her into OR One, and strand me in the marble-and-gray-leather waiting room. I watch through the wall as a dozen figures in scrubs fight to stabilize her for upload. With all my practice at saying goodbye, I should be calm, but I can\u2019t breathe.\n At some point in the next hour, Lisa comes. She hugs me and kisses me and does her best to console me.\n I stare at her head. She has shaved it bald since this morning. It gleams in the sterile light from the OR.\n \u201cI\u2019m getting a port installed,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s for this new crossfire app . . . \u201d\n I let her words drift past me. When she falls quiet for a moment, I speak into the silence\u2014because speaking is easier than thinking.\n \u201cWhat if every goodbye is really the last one we get?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean.\u201d\n \u201cYou talk about fragmentation. Every time you stuff a new gadget into your brain, you fragment away from the human race, right?\u201d\n Lisa shrugs. \u201cSure.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t think you need a gadget. Every time you leave the room, you come back a different person. Ten times a day you fragment away from me. A hundred times. Every time you walk out the door, I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d\n A thousand times I should have said goodbye to you. A thousand times, as I lost the woman that I loved.\n \u201cThat\u2019s great, Rico.\u201d Lisa chuckles. \u201cWe\u2019re human fractals, huh?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Loosely coupled fractals\u2014that\u2019s what we are. We split and divide, hoping that the near-random walk of our fragmentation will bring us close enough to interact. To procreate. To love.\n Once Mom is conscious and ready for upload, I ask Lisa to leave me with her.\n \u201cI\u2019ll see you at home,\u201d she tells me.\n I\u2019m not sure she will.\n Mom lies entangled in wires and IV lines. She was never a small woman, but the operating table dwarfs her. She looks out of place and powerless and scared.\n But a faint smile curves her lips as I approach. \u201cToday\u2019s the day, huh?\u201d\n I sit down by her side and take her hand and tell her the truth. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to let you go.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cSee what I built for you, Mom.\u201d I press a few buttons, and the circular walls of the OR light up.\n A house with an elegant colonnade, its doors a rich green. An indoor patio lit by a soaring skylight, with dark wooden rocking chairs and a blinding white canvas stretched on an easel. A bedroom with tall windows that look out on the sea\u2014they hold no glass, only wooden shutters to close against the evening chill.\n Wonder touches Mom\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, Rico. Just as I remember it.\u201d\n I get to my feet, my heart pumping fast. \u201cYou want to go there, Mama?\u201d\n \u201cThis house belongs to the girl I was.\u201d Mom sighs. \u201cThat girl is gone.\u201d\n \u201cBut Mom, you love this house\u2014\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you give me black soles!\u201d\n My hands drop to my sides. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you decide, Mom. I want you to be happy.\u201d\n \u201cI am happy. A little bit afraid, but happy. I\u2019ve got no more goodbyes to say but one.\u201d Mom smiles. \u201cYou can keep me in that house if you like. It won\u2019t be me, not really\u2014but you know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cI need you.\u201d I blurt out the words before I can stop myself. Then I stand there, my face flushed, as vulnerable as I have ever been.\n \u201cWhere\u2019s my sketchbook?\u201d Mom asks.\n \u201cIt\u2019s outside. It\u2019s not sterile.\u201d\n \u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d\n So I bring it in. Mom gestures for me to open it. With trembling fingers, I flip the cover.\n I stare for long moments at the drawing that faces me. Then I turn the page. And another.\n I leaf through the sketchbook in a confused daze. This is what Mom\u2019s been working on?\n \u201cI draw what I see,\u201d she says.\n What she saw was a hundred figures. A hundred middle-aged men. In t-shirts and business suits and bathrobes and beach shorts. Some tired, some eager, some angry, some sad.\n All of them me.\n I recognize none of them.\n That\u2019s fragmentation too. It\u2019s not just the people around you who change.\n I\u2019m not the boy who loves Mom\u2019s rice and beans.\n I\u2019m not the guy who loves Lisa.\n I\u2019m the man who can\u2019t let go.\n \u201cI loved every one of you,\u201d Mom says to me.\n I cling to those words like a lifeline. Here\u2019s one constant throughout all my splintering changes. It\u2019s not fair that I must give that up.\n \u201cI said goodbye to every one of you,\u201d Mom says to me.\n I stare at her for moments. I stare at her for a long time, even as her breathing grows labored and her heartbeat uneven.\n The decision races at me full speed.\n Can I give her up?\n Can I keep her bound? Constant, unchanging from year to year in her virtual prison, while I fragment and break and splinter away?\n Will she love me if I do?\n Will I love her?\n Or will I let dust gather on the screen of her viewport?\n I only know this:\n In a while, Mom will take her final breath.\n In a while, I\u2019ll make a decision.\n And then, whatever that decision, I\u2019ll say goodbye to her for the last time.\n Tom Crosshill's fiction has been nominated for the Nebula Award, andhas appeared in venues such as Intergalactic Medicine Show, Beneath Ceaseless Skies and Lightspeed.

Lucrative and popular, media tie-in fiction is a sub-genre all to itself. It even has its own professional organization, the International Association of Media Tie-in Writers. At the same time, tie-in fiction has a reputation for being hackwork, a mercenary-gig writers do for money for a pre-set audience, creating fiction that doesn\u2019t require much more skill than those of the pulp forefathers who gave it birth.\n So it may be surprising that many award-winning genre writers have also tried their hand at tie-in fiction. Some have done it for money, some for love, most for both. Jeanne Cavelos (World Fantasy award, editor) wrote four Babylon Five novels. Bruce Holland Rogers (Pushcart Prize, Nebula, Stoker and World Fantasy award winner) wrote a novel based on the card game Magic: the Gathering. Jeff VanderMeer (World Fantasy, Rhysling award) just completed a novel based on the Predator film franchise, and the experience led him to produce the writing book How to Write a Novel in Two Months. And Elizabeth Hand (Tiptree, Nebula, World Fantasy) has published more tie-in fiction then the above combined, from the popular Star Wars franchise to the universally panned Catwoman flick. Bruce Bethke\u2019s (Philip K. Dick award) is unfortunately best known for the novelization of the box office disaster Wild Wild West.\n This is not a screed for or against tie-in fiction (if you love or hate reading the continuing adventures of anybody-who-is-not-real, great!), but instead a sample of experiences of award-winning authors writing for worlds not their own. Some experiences were good, some were bad, and some were downright fugly.\n THE TIES THAT BIND\n You don\u2019t have to be a fan of tie-in fiction to write it, but it helps. Jeanne Cavelos adored the well-regarded tie-in fiction James Blish had done for Star Trek (eleven volumes from 1967-1975). While a senior editor at Dell Publishing in the 1990s, she also became a fan of the SF series Babylon Five (B5), in part because it seemed smarter than your average TV series in its attempt to use a novel structure for the series. After securing the rights to have Dell publish B5 novelizations, she left editing to pursue her own fiction, only to have Dell ask her to write a B5 novels. She did both a stand alone (The Shadow Within) and trilogy (The Technomage Trilogy). She pitched her novel idea to B5 creator and chief writer/director J. Michael Straczynski, which he loved. For the trilogy, she worked from an outline Straczynski provided. \u201cJoe\u2019s outline had as its centerpiece a great revelation about the techno-mages,\u201d Cavelos said. \u201cMy heart jumped when I read it. That was a thrill, to be handed material like that.\u201d She was thrilled to be adding to the story of a show she respected.\n Jeff VanderMeer was also weaned on Blish\u2019s Star Trek work. When the opportunity arose to write a novel based on the Predator franchise, he grabbed it. He\u2019d enjoyed the films and this was a chance to write a different kind of fiction than his usual fare. \u201cI love Joyce and Nabokov, but I also love action-adventure movies and really good thriller novels and pulp noir. So this just seemed to me like exploring some aspect of my tastes I\u2019d never worked on in fiction form before. It\u2019s bloody, violent, has some sex in it, and it\u2019s amoral. Period.\u201d\n Rogers had gone to Wizards of the Coast to pitch an original novel and instead was offered the opportunity to write a novel based on the new and massively popular Magic: The Gathering card game. He loved the game, thought it would be an intriguing challenge, and the money was good.\n Elizabeth Hand, however, had no interest to explore but the bottom line. \u201cI\u2019m a working writer,\u201d Hand said. \u201cI don\u2019t teach or have a tenured position anywhere, or a pension, or a 401K. This is my day job, and doing media work has been a way to help pay the bills and underwrite my serious fiction. Period.\u201d\n STRUGGLING AGAINST RESTRAINTS\n Tie-in fiction is largely defined by its limitations. You can\u2019t just kill Captain Kirk or give Chewbacca a sex change, no matter how awesome a story might result. Your work must be consistent with the original source material, and this consistency is referred to as the \u201ccontinuity.\u201d Depending on the property, continuity can be light or heavy, and such limitations can be a pillory box for creativity. \u201cI would blow my brains out if I had to write in the Star Trek or Star Wars universe,\u201d said VanderMeer, \u201c . . . they have such a huge bible and backstory, I wouldn\u2019t have the patience and I personally would feel horribly claustrophobic.\u201d\n Both VanderMeer and Rogers worked on properties whose continuity had few limitations. VanderMeer had a few Predator movies and novels, but otherwise was left to create the story he wanted for Predator: South China Sea. The approach was the same as his other work \u201cwrite for myself and hopefully people will like it.\u201d Still, he needed to keep in sight what \u201cthe core Predator audience would like.\u201d\n For his novel based on a card game, Rogers had almost no narrative to work with. \u201cI actually saw this as positive . . . As long as I wrote fiction that used creatures, settings, and props from the game world, I could tell pretty much whatever story I wanted to tell.\u201d The result was Ashes of the Sun, written under the penname Hanovi Braddock, a fantasy novel that found appeal with the gaming and non-gaming fans. Normally a slow writer, Rogers felt he could just \u201cwrite and write without deciding on every detail. The editors might want to change everything I did, in any case, so I might as well commit to the first ideas that I thought of. As it turned out, the editors wanted minimal changes. And the novel was pretty good.\u201d\n Cavelos, on the other hand, dealt with the breadth and depth of B5\u2019s continuity limitations. \u201cI wrote my first B5 novel, The Shadow Within, while the TV series was still on the air. Major revelations about my main character, Anna Sheridan, and the novel\u2019s antagonists, the Shadows, were forthcoming on the show, though I didn\u2019t know this. I only found out when some B5 fans in the UK (where the show aired about a month ahead of when it aired in the US) emailed me. This forced me to make a bunch of 11th-hour changes once I did get the information. Luckily, these changes were generally minor, but chasing down the information caused a lot of anxiety and extra work.\u201d\n For Cavelos, writing her B5 novels was \u201charder than writing my own fiction in many ways.\u201d Her original plots smacked against the continuity of the B5 universe, and again she had to scramble. But in the wake of this aggravation, she found ideas that were significantly better. \u201cThe limitations forced me to be more creative, to not go with my first thought (which was usually a familiar plot device) but to come up with something better. I feel that, in many ways, the more limitations I have, the better I write.\u201d But Cavelos conceded that her B5 experience was also exceptional. Other properties are jammed with rules. \u201cAt some point I think the rules can become overwhelming.\u201d\n Even in the continuity-thick Star Wars universe, Hand found some room to breathe. \u201cThe four Boba Fett juveniles were all original books that I wrote, with original storylines and some original characters. I might receive directions to have various Star Wars characters make an appearance, but that was it. So it was fun. I wrote Hunted as a Jack Vance juvenile and had a great time with it.\u201d George Lucas and the Gang were generally supportive, great to work with, and hands off. Not like Chris Carter, who demanded all the adjectives and adverbs be removed from her X-Files movie novelization. She also had the unenviable task of translating the awful script of Catwoman into something readable, only to have several more versions of the script arrive at her door, each with a different ending, each forcing her to do a re-write of a bad story that kept getting worse and worse.\n Still, such frustrations were water off a duck\u2019s back. For me,\u201d Hand said, \u201ctie-in work is work for hire and nothing more. It\u2019s hack work, and I\u2019ve never pretended otherwise . . . I have no emotional investment in media work, and no artistic investment save that I try my best to produce something worth the cover price.\u201d While never substandard work, it wasn\u2019t her best.\n FROM GOOD TO BAD TO UGLY\n All these complaints pale compared to the tsunami of ruin that accompanied Bruce Bethke\u2019s efforts to novelize the film The Wild, Wild West. This cautionary tale is fully recounted at his website, so here is a summation of his self-described Faustian bargain. Bethke, the man who coined the word cyberpunk in 1980, had won the Philip K Dick award for his SF novel Headcrash in 1995. While acclaimed, it had mediocre sales, so when Bethke attempted to sell his next original novel, his editor said that while she loved the book, they could only make an \u201cinsultingly low\u201d offer for it.\n But, if he wrote a bestseller, he\u2019d have more stroke with the publisher, and his future work would likely get a lot better advances. The editor said she had a tie-in project that would do the trick, the novelization of an action/comedy film staring Will Smith that would guarantee sales of an estimated 250,000 to Smith\u2019s large fan base.\n Bethke respected the original script and signed on to do the project so he could do his next novel with the promise of a solid advance. In doing so, he walked into a creative and imaginative bramble bomb. The original scriptwriters were fired, and a rotating door of replacements was brought in. Plot, character, setting and tone changed monthly as new scripts arrived. Eventually, Bethke was receiving faxes on a daily basis regarding script tweaks, and was expected to change the entire book at the same pace. The deadline approached before final script approval was made and the book went production with many continuity breaks from the final movie.\n Then, the film tanked. Warner Brothers lost $180 million. The book sold in the mid 30,000. The film\u2019s failure was a tar-baby that glommed onto Bethke\u2019s name. When he pitched his next novel to Warner, he received a letter saying they could no longer afford to buy novels from him at all.\n Ten years later, the experience still stings. Yet, the field is not all doom and gloom. \u201cI\u2019ve talked this business over with a lot of writers over the years,\u201d Bethke said, \u201cDragonlance writers, Star Trek writers, game spinoff writers, screenplay novelization writers -- and in the end, I have to conclude my experience with Wild Wild West was exceptional.\u201d He also noted that many people can write good and fun media tie in work, and novelizations have many more restrictions and headaches attached to them.\n Still, he warns against tie-in fiction if your real heart in fiction is to compose original, compelling work. \u201cIn the long run [tie-in fiction] will only anger and disappoint you, and sap the energy you need to chase your idiosyncratic vision, whatever it may be.\u201d In short, stick to your original-fiction guns and \u201cdon\u2019t quit your day job.\u201d\n CONCLUSION\n Jeanne Cavelos, Elizabeth Hand and Bruce Holland Rogers have largely given up writing tie-in fiction, each one feeling their time is precious and best spent on their own fiction. VanderMeer may or may not take up another property in the future. And Bethke won\u2019t touch one with a ten-foot clown pole. Each one looked at the sub-genre a bit different than when they started, for good or ill.\n VanderMeer had his expectations challenged. \u201cI\u2019m on record as saying I think tie-in fiction is crap. But it\u2019s easy to say that if you haven\u2019t written one . . . Would I have thought to do a Predator novel without luck and chance? Would I have done one without being paid up front? No. But from the beginning I thought of it as an interesting challenge . . . All I can really say is, like always, I tried to write an honest book and to invest it with the sense of beauty and horror I find in the world. And that it truly gets stranger and stranger as it goes along. You\u2019ll find many VanderMeer signatures.\u201d Plus, it has a Predator in it!\n Jeanne Cavelos acknowledges the field has problems. \u201cWhile there has certainly been plenty of bad tie-in fiction (and I mean plenty), there has also been some great tie-in fiction. It\u2019s sad that tie-in novels are dismissed by critics and by many writers of \u2018real\u2019 fiction. A writer of a tie-in novel is doing the same job that a writer of an episode of a TV show is doing. The writer of the TV show episode can be celebrated, can be awarded an Emmy. The writer of the tie-in novel can\u2019t even get reviewed . . . We could value [their work] a bit more.\u201d\n Rogers enjoyed his experience, but won\u2019t dip back in. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not sufficiently motivated by money to be interested in any work but work that is entirely my own.\u201d Hand has given up writing tie-ins, focusing on her own work. She never pretended tie-in was anything other than hack work, though she had no problems with writing it, nor disdain for anyone else who takes up the work, whatever their motivation. \u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate in that I\u2019ve kept the two streams of writing separate in my own professional career, but I\u2019ve never written under a pseudonym, or denied having done media work. Still, I prefer not to. It takes time and energy from the work that matters most to me.\u201d\n Bethke concurs. Despite his experience, though, he offered this final does of pragmatism. \u201cThere are good media companies to work for. There are insane idiots who treat writers like migrant bean-pickers. The best advice I can offer to any writer who is thinking of tackling this kind of work is, do your due diligence. Contact other writers who have written for this media company before. Don\u2019t believe the hype, ever. Try to get some sense of what you\u2019re getting into before you sign anything.\u201d\n Writers come to tie-in fiction for different reasons. Some dig contributing to a mythos they love, adding their unique voice to the existing choir. Others desire a fistful of dollars and just get the job done. Most are stuck somewhere in between, just as the work itself is caught between the large and enthusiastic demands of readers and the disdain of the sub-genre from those outside its boundaries. Wherever you fall in the spectrum, tie-in fiction is too popular to die. Just like Spock!\n Jason S. Ridler is a writer, improv actor, and historian.

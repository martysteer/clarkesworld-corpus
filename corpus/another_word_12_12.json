I can still remember a friend of mine struggling to describe a new programming trick that he was working with. He called it a hyperlink. At the time, it sounded like it might be an interesting way to do footnotes some day. But the world changed and moved on. It\u2019s very good at doing that, and its not much good at going backward. There are people who voted in the last election who never knew a world where tracking down information meant going to a library, a world without hyperlinks.\nI began working in technical support for a small Internet service provider in the mid-\u201990s, when the advertisements on the television from companies like IBM and AOL could be summed up as \u201cInternet: You don\u2019t know what it is, but you need it. Go! Buy!\u201d They worked just as well as ads for the company I worked for. They weren\u2019t boasts about whose service was best so much as announcements of a paradigm shift. Even with promotion into management, I was on the phones for nine years while the world changed. I went from figuring out init strings for 28.8 modems to programming routers to allow connections to virtual private networks. I saw that things were changing, but not always how. Ebooks still do things that surprise me sometimes. And I have now bought software that will block my Internet access for hours at a time so that I can get my work done without the temptation to check my email or Facebook or Twitter just one more time in case something interesting happened.\nThe dynamics of my own thought process have changed. I used to read almost exclusively from books and spend a relatively long time thinking about what I\u2019d read, only because while I was walking home from school or waiting at a bus stop, I didn\u2019t have anything more with me at the moment. Now I read mostly from a computer screen, and often in tiny, fleeting sips that I forget almost as soon as I\u2019ve seen them.\nBut I didn\u2019t come here to decry the Internet or celebrate the past. This endless sampler plate of Cracked.com articles and snarky comments at 140 characters or fewer isn\u2019t by necessity better or worse than reading a book without being able to jump out to a Wikipedia article. It is different, though. Some of the changes I feel like I saw coming. More distractions, for example. Or the pressure to keep things introductory, since any post might be the first thing the reader bumps into. Other aspects, I didn\u2019t: for instance, the increase in literacy that comes from having an entire generation communicate through text. Or the long awaited and justly celebrated death of the mass market returns system.\nWhat I see shaping genre fiction most in this age, though, is the democratization of authority.\nAs with many things, the change in the availability of information hasn\u2019t created a whole new way of thinking so much as shifted the emphasis. Echo chambers or groupthink or being-inside-the-bubble has been part of human behavior forever. What has changed is the ability to find opinions similar to your own. When I was growing up, the media I had to work with\u2014telephones, television, letters, newspapers, books, radio\u2014had one thing in common: no search function. No way to take a huge body of information and pluck out only the thing I was looking for. Today my daughter is in first grade, and she\u2019s just starting to bring home assignments like \u201cfind five facts about penguins\u201d and \u201cresearch who Captain Cook was.\u201d With a kind of nostalgia, I steer her toward books. When we\u2019re looking for facts, though, nothing\u2019s easier than a search engine.\nThat\u2019s also true when I\u2019m looking for opinions. It\u2019s never been easier to reach out to find people with whom I already agree and then repeat and reinforce our opinions to each other until they ossify into facts. There have been a few times that I\u2019ve found myself following links down rabbit holes into communities with which I profoundly disagree, and seeing the self-confident, self-congratulatory, and mind-bendingly wrong opinions being shared there was deeply unnerving. I imagine folks who wander by mistake into my bubbles feel the same.\nWhich brings me, in my roundabout way, to Arthur Krystal\u2019s recent article in The New Yorker, \u201cIt\u2019s Genre. Not That There\u2019s Anything Wrong With It!\u201d In it, Krystal makes a series of arguments that strike me as weirdly old-fashioned, condescending, and unfamiliar. He makes reference to a poem by Dryden. He describes genre fiction as books that \u201cstick to the trite-and-true, relying on stock characters whose thoughts spool out in Lifetime platitudes.\u201d He uses the adjective \u201cjejune\u201d with, so far as I can tell, a straight face. He celebrates literary fiction\u2019s ability to \u201cbreak the frozen sea inside us\u201d under a headline that\u2019s a TV sitcom reference.\nThere is, apparently, an echo chamber in which this article reads as something other than self-parody. And I think that, once upon a time, there was a world in which simply by having been published in The New Yorker, Krystal\u2019s opinion would have had some weight. I live on the Internet, though, and I am no longer trained to recognize that authority. When I see this, my first reaction is the disbelieving laughter of someone who\u2019s just fallen into Wonderland. Krystal\u2019s presentation of himself is a caricature of a literary critic. Insecure intellectual defensiveness rises off his article like fumes. And yet, there is a place in my culture where his opinion would be taken seriously.\nWell, not in my part of it, clearly.\nIt is very tempting for me spend a few more paragraphs making fun of Krystal. His article is mean, pompous, and trite, and I want to attack it and him. Only I know that he would be as dismissive of me as I am of him. When I pause in my gleeful disdain of his disdain, the thing that\u2019s interesting is that I see this dynamic everywhere. It\u2019s not just the usual dichotomies either: the Republicans against the Democrats, the Palestinians against the Israelis, the brains against the jocks.\nThere was an anecdote I heard once about a man in the Washington press corps bringing a date\u2014a professional model\u2014he particularly wanted to impress to a party made up of some of the most powerful, important, and (critical for my argument here) elite journalists in the world. The model\u2019s comment was something along the lines of how sad it was watching all the geeks trying to have fun. For her, it seems to me, being a member of the elite meant something different and incompatible with what her date meant. She came from a different subculture, and so the status of the people around her wasn\u2019t just invisible to her. It was literally insignificant.\nThere was a time in my life when the culture had, if not a single voice, then a profoundly dominant one. Someone on TV or the radio or in the newspaper had authority simply by being there, and their opinions mattered. There was a time before that when an avid reader could read every science fiction and fantasy book published in the US in a given year. There was a time when there were only four channels on the TV, and if you missed a program, it was gone. People shared a context by default, and because that context included definitions of authority, they shared an implicit idea of who and what was important.\nIt\u2019s always been possible to create a subculture with its own definitions of what matters, its own idioms and conventions, and its own standards by which to judge who is to be taken seriously. What\u2019s changed is the activation energy. Because of how we communicate, it has become easy to insulate ourselves with people who have our same interests, definitions, opinions, and interpretations. Things outside that context fade and lose their power, or else just stop having any bearing on each other. Krystal\u2019s opinion that genre fiction is inferior and my opinion that Krystal is kind of a yo-yo are both subjective, and so they can both be true in their contexts. In practice, they are so unrelated, they aren\u2019t even in conflict.\nI once heard Lev Grossman say in an interview that he was worried that fiction might lose its place at the center of the cultural conversation. My first response was to look back over my four-plus decades of life and try to remember a time when it was at the center. I misunderstood. When Grossman said \u201cthe\u201d cultural conversation, he didn\u2019t mean the one about Kim Kardashian\u2019s marriage or how guardian angels disprove evolution or which team is most likely to win the big game. His definition of culture wasn\u2019t concerned with what issues were being discussed by the largest demographic slice of the country. He meant, I think, the conversation among people who matter. People with authority. The real culture.\nThere was a time, in my life but not in my daughter\u2019s, when I\u2019d have known who he meant.\nDaniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

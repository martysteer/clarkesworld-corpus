Slattum is a self-taught artist, his work entering the surreal world of innerspace. After a near-death experience in 2007, inspired by a personal enlightenment, Slattum fell into a world of paint. Stemming from a meditative doodle, his subject gravitates toward the esoteric realms of psychology & philosophy with the archetypes who inhabit them. Through the doorway of art, he invites the viewer to travel into these worlds and take on their own journey. Working from his studio in Woodburn, Oregon, his work is collected internationally."}

Take a look around you and remember it all: the gray sky that reveals no sun and casts no shadows, the dense blackness of trees encircling this place like a crown. You step out of the car, crushing wet gravel underneath your shoes, and marvel at how little this feels like a dream.\nBehind you, Lomas shuts the door to the driver\u2019s seat. You both squint at the sleek structure looming in the near distance, the crown jewel against the surrounding forest. You imagine the building was designed to look formidable, modern, but to you it just looks lonely. The concrete fa\u00e7ade is punctured by thin, black windows and angular frames, steadfast against the sky as it cleaves fast-moving streams of clouds. You are hardly an expert in anthropology, but you\u2019ve seen enough of Lomas\u2019 field to know that this is not a place dedicated to it. But what else could it be? When Lomas had broken the news to you back in Cambridge, his only justification for the half-day\u2019s travel and two-night stay deep in the Appalachian forests had been a single, cryptic sentence. I have been informed of a machine with great abilities.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Lomas mutters, and you can only imagine what aspect of this situation he is referring to. He taps the side of his temple and reads something off the Iris of his eyes. \u201cWell, at least we made good time.\u201d\nYou tap your temple too, and a small display blinks into your vision, the numbers 4:50 hovering over the tops of trees. You close out of the screen and exhale slowly, taking stock of yourself. Your neck aches, your limbs cramped and deadened, the hairs on your arms prickling at the chill. Despite everything, though, you can\u2019t help but feel a little giddy that you\u2019re standing here. This place hangs in your mind like a memory, a ghost. As if you are fated to be here. Lomas walks past in your peripheral vision, setting off toward the entrance, and the fog is beginning to soak through your jacket. Still, you let yourself stand here, just for one moment more, and breathe.\nAxiom #1: Lomas never tells you anything. This used to drive you crazy in the beginning\u2014so many times you\u2019ve sat seething at your desk, caught uninformed and unprepared, barely resisting the urge to splash coffee all over his ratty clothes and quit right then. But now you have come to accept this quirk as a kind of fundamental truth, and this time when he tells you to pack your bags, you are not too surprised.\nLomas doesn\u2019t actually teach at the university, either. He says he prefers his research, and you\u2019re quietly dubious of his abilities as an effective lecturer anyway. Consequently, for all the time you\u2019ve spent with him, and all the acclaim he\u2019s garnered as a professor, you\u2019ve learned surprisingly little about the field of predictive anthropology. Most days, your tasks are painfully menial: fetching books, transcribing interviews, documenting artifacts, and the like. That\u2019s Axiom #2: never get your hopes up. But now you and Lomas are trekking through the damp grass, the thick glass doors you approach leaking a silvery light, and you feel yourself doubting your own adages, wondering if this time might be different.\nThe first floor past the entrance stretches as tall as the structure itself, subsequent floors wrapping around the perimeter, a mandala of endless coiled hallways. You feel caught inside the body of a giant, its rib cage expanded and taut with breath, about to give to a gusty sigh. In the center of the floor, a young woman perks up when she sees you enter. Her white lab coat flaps behind her as she rushes over, her footsteps echoing over the marble floor. She shakes Lomas\u2019 hand and introduces herself as Celine, principal researcher. Lomas nods, prior communication evidently established, and unthinkingly you mouth her name to yourself softly\u2014Celine. The name suits her, you think. Her dark hair is cropped at the shoulder, and her brown eyes gleam as they jump to your face. You realize it is from her own Iris, the micro display bright with open windows. \u201cYou must be Professor Lomas\u2019 assistant, right?\u201d she asks, extending a hand.\nYou take it, stammering. \u201cJules.\u201d Iris technology isn\u2019t anything new; the majority of the population has gotten the necessary operation by now, effectively obsoleting the need for cell phones altogether. Sometimes it still throws you to watch someone\u2019s eye shift and flicker like that, their presence always slightly veiled. Then again, it might just be her actual face that\u2019s making you nervous.\nThe corners of Celine\u2019s lips turn up slightly as she meets your eyes, but her gaze shifts back to Lomas after barely an instant. \u201cI apologize that the Director couldn\u2019t be here to meet you,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had to finish up some work first. Life at the lab can be like that, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d The lab. The syllable drips with ubiquity, a monosyllabic pervasiveness.\n\u201cNo need to apologize. In all the time I\u2019ve known him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ever been on time,\u201d he replies breezily.\nSo Lomas knows this man. Celine laughs politely, digging through her coat pocket. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll show you to the Director\u2019s in the meantime. I\u2019m sure you two must be starving.\u201d She hands you each a key card, VISITOR printed neatly and dangling from a metal clip. You pin yours to your lapel and she walks you over to the elevator, the giant\u2019s great glass spine. You step inside the compartment as she swipes her ID and presses the last number from the dense array of buttons, to floor 82. The ground starts to distance itself from your feet, and you can feel Celine\u2019s eyes watching both of you. The car rattles skyward.\nAfter a few long minutes, you slow to a stop and step into a dimly lit foyer. Only now do Celine\u2019s last words really register with you, and you realize you are standing in someone\u2019s living quarters. The apartment\u2019s escher-esque layout unfolds before you, open doorways throwing isometric shadows over the bare, cream-colored walls. A long table is set with plates and glasses to your right, beside sleek floor-to-ceiling windows. To your left, pristine couches and throw pillows surround a lit fireplace. Every doorway you can spot reveals only hazy darkness, and you suspect this intimate gathering space obscures the floor\u2019s true size.\nCeline glides through the apartment, taking one look at both of your faces and hiding her smile. \u201cIt\u2019s tradition that the penthouse is passed on to every Director,\u201d she explains. She reaches the windows and peers down at a blurry, tannish patch in the distance. \u201cThough the rest of us aren\u2019t far.\u201d\nYou squint and realize you are looking at the roofs of long, squat buildings, barely wider than trailers. You look back at her.\n\u201cYou live there?\u201d Instead of answering, she shrugs and points you and Lomas to the dining table, murmuring that the Director should just be a few minutes longer. You take a seat and instantly feel a little ridiculous, a trio of seats occupied at an expanse that should seat at least twenty.\nCeline sits too, folding her hands together and turning her attention to Lomas. You notice she\u2019s closed out of her Iris as she asks about his work, revealing the true amber of her eyes. You would hardly describe Lomas as a charismatic figure, but her attentiveness seems to invigorate him, and he ambles on easily about his research interests, case studies, and academic papers stuck in peer review hell. When he finally draws a breath, she asks how he knows the Director.\nLomas stalls for only a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re old friends from university.\u201d\nCeline cups a candle in the palm of her hand and frowns. \u201cDidn\u2019t realize he had any friends.\u201d\nThe elevator dings and the conversation falls silent. After a moment, the doors slide open and a man strides into the room, his face stretching into a broad smile upon seeing the guests at his table. You know instantly that he must be the Director, and yet he looks nothing like you were expecting. There is not an ounce of mad scientist in his slick appearance; his face is all sharp features mellowed with slight salt-and-pepper stubble, the lab coat uniform swapped for dark slacks and a crisp button-up.\nLomas rises from his seat as the Director approaches, and the two men grip each other as they shake hands. Lomas\u2019 worn, pilling jacket and scruffy face stand in particular contrast against the newcomer, who laughs as he takes in his appearance.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe how long it\u2019s been. Look at you,\u201d he says, his voice rich and steady. Lomas chuckles in reply, and you can feel their rapport become palpable, years of rust shed instantly. The Director turns to you next and shakes your hand, his smile mesmerizing. It\u2019s hard to look him in the eyes. Celine disappears behind a door, coming out quickly with covered platters and a bottle of wine, and the Director tells you all to dig in.\nDinner turns out to be delicious, a stream of dishes you can\u2019t name and certainly could not afford. You plaster on a grin for most of the meal and pick at your meat, some kind of lamb, while the two men reminisce about past rendezvous and acquaintances. At one point, the Director disappears into a hallway and comes back with a stack of old photos. You and Celine sit together and sift through the pictures, squinting at the fuzzy faces. This is the farthest back you\u2019ve glimpsed into Lomas\u2019 past by far, and you\u2019re amazed at the sight of his tufts of hair, his unlined smile. In one picture you see him standing alongside two men: one a grinning, handsome Director, the other appearing to be the Director\u2019s clone, with the same sharp jaw and light eyes.\nThe Director glances over, noticing your puzzled expression. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he says quickly. Lomas stares at the picture until the Director hands it to him. Lomas takes the photo wordlessly and tucks it into his jacket. You look down and remember your axioms.\nThe night goes on. The conversation moves to the fireplace, and the Director pours both you and Lomas a copious amount of wine. You take slow sips and grimace at the musty taste; Lomas reaches his third glass. The Director speaks generously, if not a bit vaguely, about the lab and its amenities. He paints a sweeping picture of the campus, where employees enjoy scenic bike paths, private gym facilities, wild buffalo sightings.\nWhen that conversation meanders into silence, the Director leans back in his chair, his face basked in a warm glow, and runs a finger around the rim of his glass. \u201cYou haven\u2019t asked about it yet,\u201d he says abruptly.\nLomas\u2019 eyes flicker up, his face slightly flushed. \u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m a little hurt. You\u2019re not even a little bit curious about my machine? After everything I\u2019ve told you about it?\u201d\nLomas\u2019 face hardens. \u201cI am sure I\u2019ll see it in due time,\u201d he says quietly.\nAfter a few moments of silence, you can\u2019t bear it. \u201cWait, that\u2019s not true.\u201d Lomas\u2019 look shoots daggers at you, but the Director\u2019s eager eyes steels your resolve. \u201cI want to hear more about your machine,\u201d you tell him.\nThe Director smiles, swirling the remnants of his glass around. He sets it down lightly. \u201cIf you had the power to go anywhere, at any time, Jules, where would you go?\u201d\nYou stare at him, unable to process his question. \u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d You can hear Lomas\u2019 tight breaths beside you and heat starts to creep into your cheeks.\n\u201cThat\u2019s alright. It\u2019s quite the question, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the Director says. \u201cImagine all the answers you could give: requests to see around the world, into the future and the past. My machine knows all of it.\u201d\nYou stare at him. \u201cSorry?\u201d\n\u201cIt is called Laplace\u2019s machine, and it is my life\u2019s work,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt creates simulations of our universe so precise that any extrapolation is possible and completely accurate.\u201d\nYou sit in silence, with only the sounds of flames bursting into existence, crackling away just as quickly. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d you ask. \u201cThat\u2019s so much information to account for. An impossible amount, even.\u201d\nCeline speaks up, for the first time in a while, smiling wanly at the obvious. \u201cThe lab has a lot of resources. We make do.\u201d Her sympathetic expression does nothing to comfort you, her words explaining nothing.\nYou finally look to Lomas, who averts his eyes. \u201cYou believe this?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says softly.\nThe Director lifts his hands in concession. \u201cUnderstandable. Tomorrow, I will show you Laplace\u2019s machine. Then you will see the truth in everything I am saying.\u201d\nLomas nods, his face turning to stone. The Director\u2019s claims stay heavy in your mouth, souring the wine that lingers in your throat, but you can\u2019t fathom what else to ask. Before you know it, Lomas makes an excuse to turn in. The Director bids him a brief farewell, and you find yourself in the elevator again, descending the 82 floors to the ground.\nOutside, you get your bags from the car and Celine conjures what appears to be a deluxe golf cart to the parking lot. She tells you your next stop is the residencies, the network of buildings you had viewed from afar, where you will stay with the rest of the five hundred or so employees. You load your bags and get into the back seat, and soon you are zipping around the lab, Celine taking the wheel with a force that leaves you gripping onto your seat. The sun has set and rolling fog spills from the trees, bringing cool night air with it. You glance back at the lab, which has taken on a lunar, ghostly glow.\nAfter a few minutes, hazy lights in the distance become glowing gas lamps, yellow billowing around each globe like smoke. Celine pulls into the lot and parks, then points you to separate rooms in the first row of buildings. You turn to your right, hoping to catch Lomas\u2019 eye, to beg him for a crumb of an explanation of tonight\u2019s events. But he\u2019s already gone\u2014you watch him swipe his card and disappear behind the door to his room. You look the other way and see empty air. Celine has disappeared too.\nWith a sigh, you start shuffling over to your own room. You swipe in, and once the lights flicker on you take stock of your accommodations. The room is plain, a far cry from the magnificent penthouse in which you had just dined, but adequate by any motel\u2019s standards. You sit on the queen bed, the day\u2019s events playing in the back of your mind, the conversation with the Director ringing loudest of all. You drag your fingers lightly across the comforter, watching minuscule folds form and shift in its topology, almost imperceptibly thin threads catching underneath the ridges of your fingerprints. You close your eyes and exhale. The thought that any entity could fully capture all the information just contained in this room makes your head spin.\nThen there\u2019s a pounding at the door, jolting you into reality. Celine is waiting when you open up, peering at you over an armful of folded towels. \u201cWhat are these for?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cThe rooms don\u2019t come with them,\u201d she says shortly.\nYou nod and then stand there awkwardly for a bit, not sure what to say. \u201cThanks for doing all this,\u201d you finally manage. \u201cI\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t really supposed to be your job.\u201d\nShe snorts. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d The wind blows strands of hair in her face, which she pushes away mindlessly. \u201cBut you should know that anything to do with Laplace\u2019s machine is top secret. Most of the employees here don\u2019t actually know about it. There\u2019s no one else but me.\u201d\nYou process her words, at the same time constructing all your questions to be as casual as possible. She sees you take a breath and silences you with a hand. \u201cSave your questions for tomorrow. Seriously, it\u2019s not a good idea to get into this now.\u201d\nYou close your mouth and bow your head in acquiescence. For another moment you and her just stand there, less than a foot apart and separated by a doorframe. Then Celine steps away and clasps her hands. \u201cI should get some towels to your boss.\u201d And then she is gone and you are staring at empty space. The sounds of her footsteps on gravel slowly diminish and despite the mundanity of the interaction that just happened, something in you aches just a little.\nYou step back and close the door, overwhelmed, relieved. At least this first day is over. You\u2019re in need of a break.\nYou go somewhere different, someplace before. You haven\u2019t met Lomas yet; you won\u2019t for many years. You are traveling down a river in the paddleboat your father built a few years ago, painted red by two brushes of different sizes. The water flows a little faster today, as the lake it runs out from has swelled from last night\u2019s rain. Mist pours on your face and leaves teardrops on your eyelashes as you battle the harsher currents that twist your trajectory.\nIf you look behind you, you can catch a glimpse of your big black dog, Reno, barking and bounding down the riverbank, trying to keep up with you. You and him have grown up together and are nearly inseparable at this point. You are watching him mid-leap when your world literally turns upside down, your head dropping into the water like a rock and forced downward by the hands of malevolent beings. These river gods drag your body through the coursing water, brief spasms of solid force hitting your appendages with the wooden planks of your boat and the river floor, disappearing and reappearing below your feet sporadically. You feel endlessly caught in this blinding rush, and yet cannot seem to change anything about it. Your journey to wherever this river takes you feels inevitable. Something inside you accepts that this is it.\nAnd then you are thrown back by a sudden force, by bared teeth clenched onto the back of your shirt collar. You thrash your arms wildly and something gradually drags you to the banks of the river. You lie there dazed, feeling ribbons of water course across your skin, and then you realize your face is above the surface, and you take a deep shuddering breath.\nAn immeasurable amount of time passes and then you can feel something nudging your hand, licking your face. You open your eyes and it\u2019s Reno. Your fear and gratitude leaves you sobbing and gripping onto his body, face buried in his fur.\nBut now\u2014now you are here again, and you are getting up from the mud, and you see the jagged branches that lie across the river, allowing someone to drag themselves to shore. You reach out and stroke Reno\u2019s fur, which drips and glosses under your touch, as if it hadn\u2019t been wet before. Reno is an old dog at this point. He could barely keep up when you were still in the boat.\nYou have come back here because you want to know. Reflecting on the incident years later, it made no sense. But in this moment, washed up on the shore, you believe so much that Reno had saved you, that he had dove into the water and dragged you from your doom. But did it really happen that way? Are you certain?\nYour Iris wakes you up the next day, swelling gentle orbs of light onto the inside of your eyelids until it becomes uncomfortably bright. You sit up and it takes a minute for you to realize where you are, fine mist still clinging to your eyelashes.\nAs you\u2019re pulling on your socks, you hear the golf cart outside rev its dinky engine. You open the door to the parking lot, where Celine is waiting for you. You look to your right and you see Lomas squinting in the sunlight as well.\nThe lab is deserted when you walk inside, and you remember that it\u2019s a Saturday. Celine leads you and Lomas to the elevator once again, but this time she swipes her ID and quickly presses the first floor button three times. The elevator jolts into motion, and your head becomes light. The ground through the glass begins to rise, shrouding you in darkness and confirming that you are, indeed, moving downward. Your body still hurts for sleep, but the descent drops your stomach and you shudder.\nThe elevator settles and the doors slide open. Lomas steps out first, his head craned up, and lets out a low whistle. He glances back at you and Celine. \u201cDamn.\u201d\nThe first thing to notice about this place is the height. The chamber you step into is huge, confusingly so: it seems just as tall as the lab when you were on its telescoping ground floor, as if in the time you\u2019ve been in the elevator a large stage crew was replacing everything in sight, while you weren\u2019t even moving at all. But this can\u2019t be so. You grapple with the fact that this place must truly be underground, another vast space stacked right below where you were just standing.\nThe three of you walk to the middle of the chamber, much smaller than the plaza of the first floor. Encircling you are black walls that seem to glow; you realize upon second glance that what you are looking at are actually many, many computers, stacked up on one another to form steep cylindrical surfaces. Cool air circulates around the room and brushes against your skin. On the floor, thick desks are strewn with paper and sag under the weight of massive monitors.\nIn the opposite corner of the room, like the north notch of a compass, lies a small cavity with a sloping ceiling that converges at a flat, blank screen. Other monitors with tiny blue text hug the walls\u2019 beveled corners. In the middle of this space you spot the Director, sitting in a black chair with his legs kicked up on the desk. He turns around and watches you approach, grinning and loosely holding a mug.\n\u201cGood morning, guys. Welcome to the office.\u201d\nLomas\u2019 expression stays steely. He eyes the mug, and you recall he hasn\u2019t had any coffee today. \u201cIs the explanation for how this works going to hurt my brain?\u201d\n\u201cJumping right into things, are we?\u201d The Director shrugs and then looks at Celine. \u201cI\u2019ll let the principal researcher do the talking.\u201d\nCeline looks back to you and Lomas. \u201cHow familiar are you two with modern physics?\u201d\nYou exchange glances. \u201cYeah, not very.\u201d\nShe nods. \u201cOkay. Um, I\u2019ll give my best high-level description and just stop me when you have any questions. So this project\u2014Laplace\u2019s machine\u2014has been in the works for decades. The theory was first proposed back in the nineties by the previous Director of this lab, Sergey Novikov. He imagined a machine built on a single, irrefutable truth: that the universe is inherently causal, and therefore deterministic. The world we live in is a product of the world that came before it, and it is the only possible product. If we gave our creation everything there is to know about the state of the universe, even for one instant, any instant, the rest of time and space could be known to us by extrapolation.\n\u201cThe idea was pretty controversial at the time. Concurrently, Novikov was in the process of dismantling the canon that was quantum mechanics, disproving it with his own radical experiments\u2014most of them done here at the lab, actually. Quantum logic inherently went against Novikov\u2019s idea because it introduced randomness into the universe, an existence in which some things we could not definitively compute. But Novikov pioneered a new theory, seed theory, which broke quantum particles into smaller, more fundamental vectors, and developed equations that, while seemingly erratic, made the outcomes of their interactions predictable.\u201d\nShe stops to catch her breath, leaving you to stare at her dumbly. You glance over at Lomas to see if he\u2019s doing any better. He\u2019s gazing at the machine, lost in thought.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big if, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He looks to Celine. \u201cYou said if you captured an instant where you knew everything about our universe, then you could extrapolate from there. Sure. But we just don\u2019t have that kind of information, do we? I mean, we don\u2019t even know what\u2019s at the bottom of our oceans.\u201d\nCeline nods for a moment, collecting her thoughts. \u201cOkay, good question. Well, that\u2019s the other component of seed theory. It states that there exists a beginning of the universe, a point zero on the proverbial axis of time. This \u2018seed\u2019 of the universe occurs before what we call the big bang, when everything was at its most dense, when there was the most order. We pooled all our efforts and computational resources into identifying the seed, testing and refining combinations of particles until we extracted the true one. Once found, the rest was just a matter of implementation and design\u2014now Laplace\u2019s machine has grown into all that you see around you.\u201d\nEveryone takes a moment to soak up the machine again. You gaze at the glittering sky of blue lights and let out a low breath.\n\u201cYou want to see it in motion?\u201d the Director pipes up, reading your mind. He spins around in his chair and starts to type. The whole chamber surrounding you starts to hum and flicker, every inch of this massive computer coming to life. The blank screen flickers to life and illuminates a slate gray rectangle. Small, white numbers pour into the screen until it is filled, their values morphing into each other seamlessly. You walk closer and strain your eyes as each number blinks in and out of existence, replaced with one just as equally arbitrary. You look back at the Director, not sure what you should say.\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d You wince as the words come out of your mouth. Not that.\nThe Director lifts an eyebrow. \u201cWhat, numbers?\u201d His face, previously full and handsome, looks gaunt in the harsh illumination. \u201cThese numbers represent vectors of particles, their energy and their momentum, their position in reality. These numbers in particular show the obliteration of Earth when it is engulfed by the expanding sun, five billion years from now. These numbers can show you the trajectory of your life, the fate of your bloodline. These are the numbers, Jules.\u201d\nYou nod your head tightly at him. Celine pipes up from behind you. \u201cThat being said, we do understand visualization would be nice,\u201d she says, advancing toward the screen, turning and leaning on the desk so that her back is illuminated. \u201cI\u2019m leading a project designed to do just that.\u201d\nYou try to wrap your head around what that would mean, everything that you could witness. A shiver runs through your body. \u201cSo we can see everything.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d The Director leans back into his chair. \u201cNot everything. We know the nature of every fundamental particle at every instant of time. That explains the formation of planets, the minutiae of a rainfall. But even with a perfect snapshot of someone\u2019s brain chemistry, I cannot explain why they feel the way they do. The one thing my machine cannot understand\u2014emotion.\u201d He fixes his eyes on Lomas intensely. \u201cThat\u2019s where you come in.\u201d\nThe room freezes with those words. Lomas cannot speak for a moment, dumbstruck. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe Director\u2019s calm demeanor doesn\u2019t waver. \u201cYou loved someone, once,\u201d he says brazenly. \u201cUsing Celine\u2019s visualization algorithms, I want to give you closure, show you the truth. And in exchange, I want to study you.\u201d\nThe two men stare at each other, with Celine the first to intercept. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but you didn\u2019t tell me that we\u2019d be performing a personal query today.\u201d She glances at you, too, but you can\u2019t give her any answers.\nLomas forces a burst of laughter, but quickly drops his smile, still in shock. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a good idea,\u201d he says softly.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve come all this way,\u201d the Director replies.\n\u201cI thought this was about\u2014you made it sound like\u2014\u201d Lomas, becoming more and more agitated, doesn\u2019t finish his sentence and just shakes his head in silence. \u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d he says, finality evident in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nThe Director\u2019s expression is indecipherable, but it strikes you as thoughtful rather than anything else. He swivels his chair away and shrugs. \u201cOf course. I won\u2019t force you into anything.\u201d\nLomas looks taken aback. \u201cI\u2014I appreciate it.\u201d\nThe Director waves his hand at Celine, his eyes glued to the screen. \u201cIn that case, then. Why don\u2019t you show them more of the lab?\u201d\nCeline is similarly duped. \u201cShould I\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cStart with the library,\u201d the Director says. \u201cI need to finish up some work here.\u201d\nAfter a beat, Celine stands up and smoothes down her lab coat. She looks tersely at the both of you before heading back toward the elevator shaft. Inside, Celine presses the button for you and stands there wordlessly. You can tell that her bafflement has morphed into ire, though you\u2019re not sure to whom it\u2019s directed. After a moment, her glare pierces through her Iris, flickering to life. Lomas stares at his feet the whole way up.\nThe elevator slows to stop halfway up the building, and you follow Celine down a deserted hallway. Sturdy, industrial-looking doors pass by on your left, while on the right you\u2019re walled in by a thick pane of glass. Peering through it, you can see floors with near-identical hallways spiraling below you, the same speckled tile and harsh LED lighting.\nYou catch Lomas\u2019 eye in the reflection. \u201cAre you okay, sir?\u201d\nHe exhales loudly and rubs his eyes. \u201cShit, I need coffee.\u201d\nYou are reminded of Axiom #3: Lomas cannot function without caffeine. The first thing you would do in the mornings is get him some coffee, so this does not bode well.\nCeline stops in front of a door suddenly, and you halt alongside her. The placard beside the door is embossed with the letters #L0B. She says something about being big fans of Borges here, a statement so witty it momentarily breaks Lomas out of his spell and makes him chuckle. Then she swipes her card, the door handle lighting green, and lets you inside.\nYou get the sensation that you\u2019ve just stepped back into Cambridge, sent somewhere on campus to fetch Lomas a book. The room is around two levels high, with rich mahogany bookshelves that curve around you. What you see filling them are not the spines of books, however; it takes a moment for you to figure it out, but you realize they\u2019re brimming with piles of scrolls, bound paper spirals that bloom like a bouquet of roses from each chamber. The air is warmer here and smells woody and sweet. It\u2019s all very jarring from the sterile hallway outside, but drastic tone shifts at the lab aren\u2019t anything new anymore.\n\u201cWelcome to the library,\u201d Celine says, leading you down the shelves to the open space in the center. \u201cHere we keep a record of every simulation we\u2019ve run on Laplace\u2019s machine.\u201d\nYou look around, taking in the heaps of scrolls. Glancing at Celine for permission, you slide out a tube from the nearest shelf labeled Ferns. The scroll itself is sealed with a strip of tape that has a large, scrawled number. You undo the tape and gingerly unroll the thick paper. Inside is a wall of small, inky numbers, just like the ones you saw flash on the screen down in the machine room. It\u2019s exactly what you were expecting and still a perplexing sight.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can read this,\u201d you say.\nShe shrugs. \u201cOnce you get the hang of it, it\u2019s not as hard as it looks. The syntax has a top-down design, so events are easily abstracted.\u201d\nYou study the scroll again, the numbers still meaningless. Behind you, Lomas mumbles something about wanting to look around on his own, and Celine lifts a yielding hand. He wanders off and disappears into an aisle. You roll the scroll up carefully and slip it back, suddenly very aware it\u2019s just you and Celine.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound rude, but . . . why print all of this? Can\u2019t it just be saved on a computer?\u201d\nCeline smiles dryly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but the Director likes his theatrics.\u201d Her mouth twitches as she stares at the walls of scrolls surrounding her.\nYou chuckle weakly. \u201cYeah, whatever just happened back there\u2014that was theatrical as hell.\u201d\nYou instantly wish you hadn\u2019t said it. Celine flushes red. \u201cHe really should have told me he was going to do that,\u201d she says apologetically. The contempt you saw in the elevator floods back into her expression. \u201cGod, I wish he would tell me anything. Sometimes I don\u2019t know how he expects me to do my job.\u201d\nYou cast your eyes above you, where Lomas has gotten himself onto the second floor and is now lurking through shelves. You think back to Axiom #1.\n\u201cSomehow I think I know exactly what you mean.\u201d\nCeline exhales, studying you carefully, and then she seems to soften. With a blink, she closes her Iris and motions you down an aisle. \u201cCome on, let me show you some of the things we keep around here.\u201d\nCeline leads you around the first floor, showing you various scrolls of interest. She tries to teach you how to read them, too, dissecting what she calls the \u201cparent vectors,\u201d but after a couple fruitless efforts on your part she drops the cause. Her explanation of what each represents is more than enough. You find the difference in magnitude striking; some, like the one you randomly plucked off the shelf, record endearingly short events. Things like the life cycle of plants or a bird egg hatching can be verified easily within the lab\u2019s walls, Celine tells you. And then there are the big events, ones that recount the formation and destruction of stars, the beginning of the universe. When you read the labels of these scrolls, which droop under their own weight, your stomach can\u2019t help but drop. Celine points out a particularly battered scroll, already splayed open on a table, and mentions that the destruction of the Earth is one of the Director\u2019s favorites.\nYou stare at the scroll\u2019s contents, the numbers a little faded from repeated unrollings. You wonder how anyone could work on this machine and keep sane. \u201cCan I ask, um. Are you\u2014\u201d\nA crashing sound from upstairs interrupts you. Lomas peeks his head out behind a railing from the balcony. \u201cSorry, sorry,\u201d he says hurriedly. \u201cI just\u2014I tried to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, they\u2019re really heavy,\u201d Celine says. You follow her up the stairs. Lomas is stooped down and picking books off the floor, the first actual books you\u2019ve seen in this library. They do look pretty hefty, with thick bindings in rich colors.\nHe shoves them back into the shelf, looking embarrassed. \u201cI can\u2019t read them,\u201d he offers. Celine tells him it\u2019s fine another time and then Lomas slinks off again.\nYou approach the bookshelf as one book threatens to tumble over. You catch it before it does and hold it up to the light. It\u2019s dark blue, embossed with a single word in gold. Celine.\nYou stare at the letters. Then you look at her. She looks back awkwardly. \u201cYou can look,\u201d she says finally. You open it and thumb through a few pages, each covered in an unyielding mass of numbers, stacked like bricks.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re really special, you get a book,\u201d Celine says softly from behind you. She points to the first book on the bookshelf, where there\u2019s around five in total. \u201cThat red one\u2019s the Director. And then the one after that is the previous Director, Sergei.\u201d She touches a green book, slimmer than the rest. \u201cThis last one is for the Director\u2019s late brother, Theo. You saw a picture of him earlier.\u201d\nThe weight in your hands feels paralyzing. \u201cHave you read all of it?\u201d you ask her.\nShe glances back at the book in your hands. \u201cI\u2019ve read some,\u201d she says, chewing her lip. \u201cOnce you get past the present, it\u2019s a little addicting. But I made myself stop, eventually. I had seen enough.\u201d You notice there\u2019s a thin gold bookmark sticking out the top, what you gauge to be sixty percent into it. You turn the book in your hands over and over, simultaneously impressed by her self-restraint and horrified by what she could have read to make her stop. A fresh sense of alarm is unfolding out of your body, all the anxiety that has been collecting since your arrival suddenly becoming unbearable.\n\u201cHow can you deal with this?\u201d you ask, unable to keep your voice from exposing your dread. \u201cHow can you go to work every day knowing that this book is here, too? Knowing that you can\u2019t change anything it says. That none of your choices matter.\u201d\nCeline blinks, stunned by your reaction. She\u2019s quiet for a while, considering the question. \u201cAll of my choices matter,\u201d she says finally. \u201cOur actions are always informed by the circumstances of our past. That means there is a reason for everything, a world I am building. That book right there is proof of that. It gives me intention. It hands me a promise.\u201d She walks over to your side and takes her book from your hands, re-shelves it next to the others. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nYour knuckles burn where her fingers had momentarily brushed them. But it\u2019s enough to siphon away your fear, like a lightning rod grounding you to reality. When you experience it this time, you are surprised at how quickly the moment passes, how briefly her hand touches yours, an action sewn together with the lightest thread. You go back and feel it again.\nThere\u2019s a day you have in mind, many years in the future. Here, reading is seen as an antiquated skill, but you are old and used to your ways. You scroll through news articles on your Iris, now called OEIs (Ocular Enhancement Implants) per the new government regulations. The name has never felt right to you, and the interface is foreign, unnatural. Your generation once pioneered this technology, and now it slips more out of your grasp with every update cycle.\nAn article catches your attention, an obituary. The name means nothing, but a location sticks out to you in the brief preview of the article, a place you can almost locate in your mind. After a few mis-selects, you pull the article up and skim over the opening words. Something in your head clicks. Every sentence dredges up images, sounds, even smells that you can barely hold onto. You can envision the laboratory they mention, the towering structure with those incredible chambers, the things you witnessed during that faraway weekend. You had met the deceased when you were a young man. He had held the position of Director for nearly thirty years, says the article, practically working up until his death. The article details his most significant discoveries, the impact he made on the field of physics overall, and his education at the same university you had worked at all those years ago.\nShe takes up barely more than a sentence near the end, but when you read her name, the entirety of her becomes vividly real. The article quotes her sentiment to continue the lab\u2019s most ambitious and groundbreaking work, to honor her predecessor\u2019s legacy. You read the sentence again and bask in every syllable, each a kernel of new information, proof that she has continued to exist beyond that weekend.\nEventually you close out of the article and wonder if memories can ever just belong to the past. All those times you\u2019ve replayed each interaction in your head, poring over scrolls together in that labyrinth of a library or taking towels out of her arms. Weren\u2019t you changing them a little every time? Every fresh coat of paint a slightly different color, so much so that now you aren\u2019t even sure if the words she says to you are hers or your own invention.\nAnd then you think back to that space below the ground, where there exists a single version of that weekend that is true. You wonder if he ever discovered what it all meant. You wonder if she knows now, too.\nThe next stop in the tour is a place Celine calls the greenhouse. This room stretches higher and longer than the confines of the library, with windows for walls and marble ceiling panels that diffuse daylight into soft, golden pools. Thick trees sprout from the soil floor and stretch to the ceiling, casting dappled shadows at your feet. Lining the pathways that cross the ground are the most verdant, lush ferns you\u2019ve ever seen. They spill onto the walkway, threatening to trip you on any misplaced step, though Celine winds her way through like it\u2019s nothing. She stoops down to show you a tag attached to the base of a fern, and you think back to the scrawled numbers on the fern scrolls in the library. You kneel down next to her and listen to her talk about the symbiotic relationship between the shady trees and temperate ferns; Lomas stays standing, gazing upward at the trees, his head evidently somewhere else.\nEventually, Celine notices this too. She follows his gaze to a small glass enclosure that juts out of the glass wall, connected to the ground by a ladder. \u201cOur magpie roost,\u201d she explains, getting up and brushing soil off her palms. \u201cWe can go up if you want. The view is nice.\u201d\nLomas eyes the enclosure warily. \u201cAnimals aren\u2019t really my thing.\u201d\nCeline shrugs and turns to you, and you nod tentatively. Together you make your way toward the enclosure. At the base of the ladder, she takes off her lab coat and stuffs it into a basket on the floor. \u201cMight want to leave any shiny things down here. Otherwise, be prepared to fight for it.\u201d\nYou hastily unclip your ID and deposit it before climbing after her, leaving Lomas by himself. You emerge into a small enclosure with an eclectic collection of mirrors, aluminum sheets, and other metallic surfaces sitting at your feet. Wooden birdhouses hang neatly down an aisle of shrubs, though you\u2019re not sure if any are currently holding birds. Seconds later, a chattering screech answers your question for you.\n\u201cWhy magpies?\u201d you ask Celine, who is cooing into a box. She reaches in and extracts a black and white bird, which fluffs its wings impatiently.\n\u201cIn terms of testing, they\u2019re more sophisticated than ferns, I suppose. But I think the Director just likes birds.\u201d She strokes its down and you notice a small tag poking out on one of its legs. \u201cDid you know a magpie can recognize itself in a mirror? They\u2019re smart things.\u201d\nThe magpie glowers at you and you edge away, approaching the edge of the enclosure where the walls slant down until all that stands between you and a plummet down the side of the lab is a knee-high barrier. From this vantage point, you can see a dizzying lay of the land: the residences across the field, the forest rolling away from you, and a sizable body of water you hadn\u2019t noticed last night. The oblong orb shimmers slightly in the cloudy afternoon sun, specks of people orbiting slowly around the perimeter.\nCeline joins you and follows your gaze. \u201cOh, yea. Lake Novikov.\u201d Her watchful expression is almost scornful. You stay silent, not wanting to admit to your phobia of bodies of water that has been instilled since childhood. The lake is a tiny marble from here, but still dread twists into your stomach like a knife.\nCeline must mistake your silence for judgment, though, and quickly amends her words. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it. I just\u2014I grew up around the ocean, and it isn\u2019t really the same.\u201d Wind blasts into the enclosure and Celine wraps her arms around her coatless body. You try to imagine her as a young girl, on the beaches of some infinite ocean.\n\u201cHave you ever considered leaving the lab?\u201d you ask her.\nShe blinks at you and then quickly shifts her eyes away. \u201cNo, never.\u201d She stands there with crossed arms, shivering. \u201cThe work I lead here is . . . irreplicable.\u201d\n\u201cSo you think the Director\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d you say.\nShe gives you a strange look. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think.\u201d\n\u201cSure it does. You\u2019re principal researcher.\u201d\nShe shakes her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I think,\u201d she repeats, backing away from the ledge and toward the exit. You turn her words over in your head until the cursing starts.\nYou look over, and Celine balks down the ladder. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d you ask.\n\u201cHe fucking took the jacket,\u201d she says, then swings down at a speed that makes you fear for her safety. You clamber down after her. When you reach the floor, you see that the coat is indeed missing from the basket, and only your small keychain and ID remain. Celine looks around wildly, but Lomas is long gone. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d she asks you, panicked.\nYou don\u2019t want to tell her you have no idea. Celine, getting this anyway, groans and starts to pace. You open your Iris and attempt to check his location and send him a message, both to no avail. Your face starts to burn. You rack your brain, retracing the steps you took today, desperately trying to figure out why Lomas went rogue.\nThen it hits you. \u201cWait. I think I know where he is.\u201d\nYou tell her and she gives you an exasperated look, but you can tell she is convinced. \u201cI cannot believe\u2014okay, listen, we need to intercept him as soon as possible.\u201d Her face contorts in concentration. \u201cBut without my ID . . . I\u2019ll have to go down to security, where I can check the cameras. If you\u2019re right, I can give you temporary swipe access, and then you\u2019re going to go in there and get him out.\u201d She waves a finger at your face. \u201cAnd noneof this reaches the Director, do you hear me?\u201d\nYou split up. Celine descends to the security office, and you hustle up flights of stairs until you reach the floor you\u2019re looking for. You race down the sterile hallways, passing endless, identical doors, but eventually you reach the three letters you\u2019ve been repeating to yourself in your head and you find yourself at the entrance to the library once again.\nCeline\u2019s plight takes longer, and so you stand there with only the sound of your breath until she finally pings you and tells you to go in. You swipe your card like Celine had done and the handle lights up green. You lean your body weight into the door and enter quietly.\nWarm air rushes to meet you as you walk through the rows of shelves. Your eyes are trained on the second floor, and soon enough the tails of Lomas\u2019 brown overcoat appear, swaying slightly from the balcony. You advance up the staircase, unable to decipher his motion, until you stand at the top. You cough awkwardly. Lomas jerks around, hiding his hands in the folds of his jacket before you can catch what he\u2019s holding.\n\u201cJules. Hi.\u201d He looks around, confirming you\u2019re alone.\n\u201cWhat are you reading, sir?\u201d You crane your neck slightly to the side, and he turns with you.\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nYou shift your weight back and glance around. This situation would be almost comical, you think, if the circumstances were any less bizarre. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d you try, \u201cI think the Director\u2019s proposition is insane too. Y\u2019know, trying to . . . solve you.\u201d\nLomas scoffs. \u201cThat\u2019s his plan? He thinks he can just look at the chemicals in my brain and know love. He thinks it\u2019s that easy.\u201d He fixes his gaze on you now, with a chilling intensity. \u201cDo you know what love is, Jules?\u201d\nYou swallow. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t this.\u201d He gestures at the table between you, strewn with unrolled scrolls. \u201cNumbers. It\u2019s more than numbers; it defies them.\u201d He takes a breath, looking pained. \u201cLove is wading into a river and giving yourself to the current. It\u2019s choosing against what makes sense, what is safe.\u201d His voice is heightened, now, his expression agitated, daring you to respond. All you can do, however, is slide your eyes from his face to his exposed hands, which clutch a thin, green book. Celine\u2019s words echo in your ears, and you can picture her next to you, pointing out the spine, explaining its contents. Your eyes slide back to Lomas and the dots connect themselves for you.\n\u201cYou loved him,\u201d you say. \u201cTheo.\u201d\nLomas\u2019 silence is enough. You nod at the book. \u201cHow did he . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cA boating accident,\u201d Lomas answers, averting your gaze. \u201cHe was alone. I told him not to go.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say. The words sink in. \u201cOh.\u201d\nLomas looks down at his hands, and you realize he had been reading the last few pages of Theo\u2019s book. You imagine him poring over the numbers, trying to pick apart their meaning, to comprehend the death of a person through the trajectory of his atoms. It occurs to you now how weary Lomas must feel, to be thrust into such a trip, to be given such a decision.\n\u201cI can\u2019t bear to watch him die,\u201d he says, his voice barely above a hoarse whisper, \u201cbut do I owe it to him? He deserves to have someone with him, right? Even like this.\u201d He looks up at you imploringly, and when you meet his eyes you are stunned to realize that Lomas is truly seeking your direction.\nAll those times you waited for Lomas to ask for your opinion, and now finally when he does you find yourself unsure to speak. You take a breath. \u201cSir, I think you\u2019re the only one who can make that decision.\u201d You stop and think about the Director, about his almighty ability to relive what was, simulate what wasn\u2019t. \u201cBut I would remember that he can go back and forth, and we can\u2019t. We only do things once.\u201d\nYou wonder if you should say more, but Lomas\u2019 face shifts in a way that tells you he understands. You give him the time he needs. And then it\u2019s time to go.\nYou jump to a little over a year in the future. You are hovering at the doorway to Lomas\u2019 office, clutching an envelope and watching him read at his desk. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to notice you and with a raise of an eyebrow you are propelled inside.\n\u201cJules,\u201d Lomas says. His face is clean-shaven, a rare occurrence. When he stands, you notice he\u2019s ditched the usual grimy brown suit for a clean, pressed black one. \u201cThis is a surprise.\u201d\nYou shift your weight from foot to foot. \u201cI just wanted to check in, sir. How was the service?\u201d\nLomas rubs his nonexistent stubble. \u201cOh, it was good. Nice to see people again.\u201d You both stare at his desk, newly lavished with several bouquets of flowers. He chuckles. \u201cThe entire time, all I could think about was how much he would have despised having two of \u2019em. Would have called it pointless.\u201d\nYou shrug. \u201cWell, a lot has happened since the first one.\u201d\nLomas grunts in agreement, then nods toward your hand. \u201cWhat do you have there?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d You look down at the envelope, creased by your tight grip. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . actually my two weeks\u2019 notice.\u201d You brace for a reaction. He doesn\u2019t do much, just stares at you curiously. You clear your throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great two years, sir, really, but . . . \u201d\n\u201cBut you need to move on. Understandable,\u201d Lomas finishes for you. He holds out his hand and takes the envelope from you, glancing over it for a second before discarding it on the desk. \u201cNo one wants to be an assistant forever, Jules,\u201d he says, looking amused.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree.\nYou look down again, at a loss for any more words. Underneath the flowers and cups of to-go coffee\u2014Axiom #3\u2014a familiar color peeks out. You take a moment to recall where you\u2019ve seen that dark green with golden trim before, and even as you recognize it as Theo\u2019s book it feels jarring to see it here, as if a year ago the lab was a set and Lomas had stolen a prop from the production.\nLomas follows your gaze to his desk. \u201cOh, right. You\u2019re probably wondering about that.\u201d\nThe machine room is just as dazzlingly tall and cold as you remember. You and Lomas walk to the center of the room, where Celine is standing with her arms crossed, speaking to a seated Director. They turn around to spot you in unison.\nThe Director\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come around,\u201d he says, sounding pleased. Your eyes meet Celine\u2019s, and her strained smile tightens.\nLomas stands there awkwardly as you all wait for him to speak. He searches for words for a few seconds before giving up, raising his arms half-heartedly and just saying, \u201cShow me.\u201d\nThe Director nods. He turns in his chair toward the desk, starting to type rapidly. The walls blink to life and a resonant hum courses through the room, just like the first time you were here. You realize with a jolt that that was only this morning. Today has felt longer than you thought possible.\nYou locate Celine, who has migrated to her own desk. She catches your eye and nudges her head toward the empty chair next to her, a silent invitation. You leave Lomas in the center of the room. His eyes are glued on the screen, which first flashes with chunks of garbled text and then slowly fills with the numbers you\u2019ve seen so much of today. Next to you, Celine works at her monitor, her Iris-lit eyes darting across the screen. \u201cI really hope this works,\u201d she whispers to you.\nYou look at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\nShe clacks away some more. \u201cI can\u2019t remember everything I read.\u201d\nFrom this angle, Lomas\u2019 back is the only dark shape against the white rectangle of numbers. The humming around you has grown surprisingly loud, and you watch the Director study Lomas\u2019 face. His lips move and Lomas dips his head in a small nod. Then, the Director cranes his head and yells, \u201cIt\u2019s all you!\u201d\nCeline takes a deep breath and taps her keyboard. The screen freezes instantly, numbers vanishing. An image appears and rapidly starts to refine, bright blocks of color growing edges and definition, then flushing with texture and shading. You begin to recognize what you see. Swaths of deep blue focus into frozen hills of water and fill up the bottom half of the screen, their crests brushing up against a dull, stormy sky. Far away, a small bright shape perches on the side of a wave at a treacherous angle. A boat.\nYour hands, suddenly very clammy, ball up, and your nails dig into your lap. The water, of course, unnerves you, but there\u2019s something more. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re sitting in a theater, but something about this image is uncannily unlike a photograph, something unnamable. Whatever it is, it does not faze Celine, who stares at the screen with triumph blazing in her eyes. With another keystroke, she sends it all catapulting into action. Millions of gallons of water shift all at once, their static rushing toward you, potent sound you were not prepared for. On screen, perfect arcs of water crash into each other like cymbals, destroying and reforming each other endlessly. In the center, the white boat plunges into the troughs of the ocean, nearly overturning, before being thrown skyward again.\nLomas stands there, and his posture is almost majestic, as if he is the Wanderer above the Sea of Fog waiting to be swallowed by the toppling waves. You want to reach out and drag him back, but the sight of such an immense body of water is paralyzing. Instead you watch him advance forward, mesmerization in each slow footstep.\n\u201cCloser,\u201d the Director commands from the front of the room. He and Celine share a glance, their expressions brimming with the same electricity. Celine sends the scene gliding forward, through foamy spray and clear sheets of water, until the boat takes up most of the screen. You bob up and down with it, the dizziness is almost unbearable. You close your eyes for a few seconds, and when you open them, a man is standing on the boat. He\u2019s fruitlessly tugging at ropes, dodging surges of water that crash onto the deck. Lomas is so close at this point that he obscures a good part of the screen, but you can still catch glimpses of the man\u2019s face as he ricochets across the deck like a ragdoll. It is unmistakably the third person you saw in that old photo, with the likeness of a young Director and an expression contorted with fear. It\u2019s Theo, brought back to life, and now about to die in front of you.\nDespite your phobia, the authenticity of this moment amazes you. And yet every time his boat just barely misses capsizing, your heart seizes, anticipating the one time it doesn\u2019t. You tear your eyes away from the screen and whisper to Celine. \u201cHow long until . . . ?\u201d\nShe studies her monitor. \u201cNot long. Maybe a minute.\u201d She looks over to you and notices your agitation. \u201cAre you doing okay?\u201d You grit your teeth and nod, watching the seconds tick up on her computer, feeling your heartbeat ring in synchronization.\nWhen the boat finally does overturn, it does so within a wave, so that you cannot see the body fall out of the vessel. It\u2019s such a small moment, something you didn\u2019t even realize happened until the white underbelly of the boat surfaces seconds later. And then you realize it happened, it\u2019s over. The scene plays out for a few more seconds before Celine halts the simulation, freezing the sea\u2019s wrath, silencing the roar to a dull hum.\nYou look over to Lomas and realize he is on his knees. He stays down for a while, small and unmoving. Then he staggers to his feet and speaks to the Director in low tones. The Director ponders whatever was said and then turns back to the computer. He makes the ocean on screen disappear, replacing it with white numbers once more. He also waves his hand at Celine, who scrambles at her own desk and types fervently.\nShe enters a command and the screen blushes with calm, pink skies, where you can soon make out sand, hear the sound of wind rushing through trees and waves lapping on shore. Eventually you see the body. It is mercifully in the distance, far enough away to obscure the inevitable mess, and instead it looks like Theo is sleeping.\nYou look at Lomas, suddenly nervous. He says something to the Director, who looks at him curiously. Together they study the Director\u2019s computer, and the Director traces a stretch of numbers with his finger. Lomas touches them too, grazing them softly while the Director tears out a scrap from a spare notebook and hands it to him with a pen.\nA seagull caws somewhere, musical and distant. Lomas\u2019 hand closes over the pen, his silhouette arching over as he starts to write.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Lomas says, back in his office, still looking at you looking at the book, \u201cIt\u2019s not like he can\u2019t make another one. It\u2019s a souvenir, just like the coordinates.\u201d\nYou can\u2019t tear your eyes away from Theo\u2019s book. \u201cBut you can\u2019t\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cNope. I don\u2019t want to, either. Sentimental purposes only.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d You crease your brow, memories of that weekend still flooding in, flashes of her. \u201cWould . . . you go back there, sir? To use the machine again, maybe see the future this time.\u201d\nLomas looks amused. \u201cYou\u2019re that worried about your future, huh?\u201d You shrug, not bothering to correct him. He looks at you thoughtfully. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I would. Of course there are events I\u2019d be curious to see. But I think I\u2019m done meddling with the order of things. Besides,\u201d he adds, \u201cI doubt I\u2019ll ever get the opportunity. I don\u2019t think either one of us will visit that basement ever again.\u201d\nYou mull over this for a while and then Lomas reaches over to clap your shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ll figure something out. Doesn\u2019t have to be today, though. Enjoy your day off, kid.\u201d\nYou give him an appreciative smile as you go, looking back a final time when you reach the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m glad you found him, Lomas.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d he says, and then you leave.\nYou can\u2019t sleep. Back at the residencies, you toss and turn in your bed and stare at the cracked ceiling, the day\u2019s events engraving themselves into your memory like a vinyl plate. The ocean you witnessed only a few hours ago rushes to devour you, a violent, familiar weightlessness overtaking your body, and in the murky darkness all you can make out are boats and scrolls and white numbers.\nAt some point you can\u2019t take it anymore. You swing your legs off the bed, move past the takeout boxes you had half-heartedly accepted earlier that evening, and exit the room. Outside, the sky is the clearest it\u2019s been all weekend, and the moon hangs low, milky and nearly full. You walk toward the desolate parking lot and stop just short of it, taking a seat on a nearby bench that basks in the glow of yellow lamp light. You think about what she\u2019s doing: if there\u2019s a chance she could be up at this hour, too.\nA rustling on your left interrupts your train of thought. You hold your breath as you scrutinize the source of the sound, anticipating a buffalo, maybe. Eventually a human-sized figure emerges instead, shuffling along the gravel path. You strain your eyes and realize a little too late that it\u2019s the Director. He spots you around the same time and waves, gesturing you over. Your heart sinks.\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep either?\u201d he asks you once you trudge over. You shrug and mumble something agreeable. The Director\u2019s eyes glint golden, reflecting the lamps. \u201cI like to walk this path during my bouts of insomnia. There\u2019s a lake nearby, good for thinking. I can show you.\u201d\nYou follow him along the path, passing through clusters of pine trees. Soon, reeds sprout in fistfuls from the earth and water comes into view, still like glass. The Director descends through the soft grass of the bank and stands at a small dock at the edge of the lake. You hover a few feet behind him.\nHe glances back. \u201cYou know, Jules, you\u2019re the only one who didn\u2019t need to be here this weekend.\u201d You say nothing. His tone irks you, but you cannot deny the statement is true. He continues: \u201cBut, well, you\u2019re here. And if you have questions, you might as well ask them.\u201d\nYou look up at him carefully, unsure if he\u2019s serious. His eyes tell you that he is. You swallow, thinking about everything that\u2019s happened today, the new world order to which you have become privy. You think about all the things you could ask him, like what your life will look like, how it will end. How it will all end. But then it occurs to you that even if you did ask all of those questions, you\u2019re not sure you\u2019d want to hear the answer.\nSo instead you ask something else. \u201cAlright. I have a question about your big problem, or whatever you call it. Why people think and feel the way they do.\u201d The Director inspects the rocks at his feet as you knit your thoughts together carefully. \u201cIf the machine knows everything that will happen, it knows whether you solve your problem. So can\u2019t you just check? If you succeed, you get the answer from the future. And if you don\u2019t, well . . . you don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe Director skips a stone across the lake\u2019s surface, and the water ripples out like fireworks. \u201cYou\u2019re smarter than you look, Jules,\u201d he says quietly.\nYou frown and decide not to respond to that.\nHe looks up at you and grins. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something I\u2019ve never told anyone, okay? I do come to an answer. I\u2019ve checked. Of course I\u2019ve checked. But for whatever reason, I\u2014I keep it in my head. Never write it down or speak it out loud. Can you believe that?\u201d He chuckles and shakes his head at the stars, as if chiding some cheeky celestial force. \u201cThe one secret I have to know, left in the one safe I cannot unlock.\u201d\nHe lets out a theatrical yawn and drops his rocks, brushing by you as he walks up the bank. When you look up he looms tall on the path\u2019s elevated plane. His face, moments ago expressive and almost tender, now reminds you of a mask. \u201cI\u2019ll be on my way back to the lab, then. Good night, Jules.\u201d\nYou give a slight nod and watch him disappear. Invisible crickets chirp softly around you, cradled within the reeds. You walk up the bank and start in the opposite direction, a tingling exhaustion finally washing over your limbs; you make your way toward the residences, toward sleep, and toward morning.\nThis morning, the package arrives. When the bell rings, you open the door and look to your feet. You can\u2019t recall ordering anything recently, but the box is unassuming enough to pick up, and you turn it over carefully in your hands, inspecting each blank side. Perhaps you were written a new back pain prescription, you wonder, or your nephew had sent you a gift from abroad. But then you bring the box into the kitchen and slice it open; the flaps unfold to reveal another sleek white box, which when shimmied apart reveals the small, silver chip, and you realize this isn\u2019t a regular delivery at all.\nOn the third day, your Iris wakes you up a quarter before eight. Celine said she\u2019d be there on the hour and arrives exactly on time, just as you are cramming the last of your clothes into your bag. You step outside and morning fog creeps in from the edges of the horizon, thick enough to obscure the surrounding forest and swallow the path to the lake that you visited mere hours ago.\nYou ride to the main parking lot, everyone sleepily silent. Upon arrival you notice the Director is nowhere in sight. Celine gives Lomas an apologetic look as she takes the keys out of the vehicle.\n\u201cHe must have overslept. It was an exhausting weekend.\u201d\nIf Lomas can sense the generosity in her statement, he doesn\u2019t seem to care. He acknowledges her words with a dazed shrug and then gets into the driver\u2019s seat of the car, not bothering to glance behind him.\nYou are left to load bags in the trunk with Celine. You move your luggage with your heart in your throat, knowing your time is running out. Celine closes the trunk with a thud, and then you turn to face her squarely.\n\u201cCome with us.\u201d\nShe stares at you. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome with us. Leave the lab, leave everything, and make a new life in Boston. You don\u2019t have to be controlled by the machine or the Director anymore.\u201d\nShe looks at you sadly. \u201cJules, I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you can.\u201d Your voice trembles with urgency, startling both of you. \u201cWe can get you a job at the university. You\u2019re smart enough, you\u2019re definitely qualified enough. You\u2019d be happy there. You can visit the ocean every day.\u201d\nShe searches your face, and you can tell your proposal is getting through, that she is imagining your proposed future. For a suspended moment you stare at each other, and you truly believe that you have convinced her.\nBut then she breaks your gaze, and you know her answer before she can even say anything. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to rescue me, Jules,\u201d she says gently. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d She watches your expression deflate and reaches out to rest her hand on your wrist. \u201cThe lab is where I belong. It always has been.\u201d Her words hold no malice, no speculation, no bite. She says them so simply that it leaves you no doubt that they are just true.\nShe lets go of your arm and you straighten up, clear your throat. Lomas turns on the engine, the car breathing to life, and you struggle to find words to leave her with.\n\u201cI hope our paths cross again someday.\u201d She smiles at you ruefully. The way her face looks as you leave her is already searing into your mind.\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope so, too.\u201d\nThe weekend is ending. You wonder if you should just pause and exit right here, with Celine still standing so close to you. But you let yourself get into the car, feel the ground rumble beneath you, her figure receding to nothing in the side view mirror. You wind through the forest, down gravel roads, toward civilization. And then finally you leave your body in the past and open your eyes in the present.\nYou sit at your kitchen table, back in your apartment, right where you started. In its absence, the vividness of the past startles you; now, the present feels dull, colorless. Your window curtains stir, leaking darkness. How long have you been sitting here? Everything had happened so quickly; mechanically, you had brushed back the hair behind your left ear, inserted the silver chip into the thin slot in your head, and waited for the click, just as you\u2019ve done for countless other Iris updates over the years. When the interface launched, you dragged your finger in the air, sliding the playhead back to the beginning and taking the course of your life with it.\nIf you had the power to go anywhere, at any time, where would you go? Why has the answer always been that weekend? You breathe quietly, memories freshly unraveled in front of you, dead emotions sprung to life again. You close your eyes, stuck in a different kind of past. You have never escaped her. Her smiling at you, brushing your hand with hers, touching your wrist. Her expression as you left the lab\u2019s campus, that quiet resignation and dignity etched onto her face. Her standing alone at the very bottom of the machine room, the years slipping through her fingers, breezing through her hair, until she had become what she had once so despised. In the moments between that weekend you have seen how it all connects, and yet you still find yourself with no further answers, just remembered questions and renewed pain.\nYour eyes flutter open again, and they drift across the dim room to the white box. You hold your gaze, struck by a moment of steadying clarity. You had become so preoccupied by what this chip had shown you that you had forgotten to ask why? And by whom? But now they beat in your head like a drum, echoed by your thumping heartbeat. An answer flutters to your mind, and it feels unreal.\nYou reach across the table. The delicate layers of the box peel back easily, your hands moving through the thin tissue paper and light styrofoam like water. It takes some time, some shifting and tilting, but finally the slip of paper clunks against the lip of the box. Your breath catches in your chest as you pick it up. It\u2019s neatly creased in half, and you take a second to hold it lightly in your fingers, savoring its potential. It is everything it could be: a world unto itself, that neither you nor anyone else can decipher yet or even describe. Maybe not even her.\nIsabel Lee is a writer, artist, and creative technologist from Chicago, Illinois.

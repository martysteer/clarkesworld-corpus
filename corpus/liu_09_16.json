Despite having long since lost all means of propulsion, inertia and gravity had conspired to carry it within range of our observation station in the Kuiper Belt.\nHaving determined that the vessel posed no danger to us, Gu He and I concluded an investigation was in order.\nUpon reaching the cabin door, I pulled at the twisted wreck of metal with the utmost of caution, managing only to pry it open halfway. More or less intact, the furnishings appeared slanted and strange, calling to mind famous works of postmodern sculpture back on Earth. It was around this time that we found the golden box, with \u201chim\u201d inside.\nHaving had already long since expired, \u201che\u201d lay in the box with stiff limbs and no signs of a functioning metabolism. Aside from a strange, triangular-shaped head, \u201chis\u201d body was shockingly similar to that of a man.\nIn a cabinet we found sheets of a rubber-like substance covered in countless symbols, each more bizarre than the last.\nAfter scanning them into the computer, we tried our luck with the automated code breaker. It took nearly a week but in the end we were left with something resembling as much study notes as it did a diary.\nI found the following passages especially significant:\nEntry #103\nYesterday we studied the Law of Area: The area of a square equals length times width. I\u2019ve already finished today\u2019s homework, including this problem: Calculate the area of an irregular polygon. By cutting it up I was able to create a square from the resulting pieces. During class today our teacher praised me in front of everyone else, saying that I was the only one who\u2019d figured it out. I think all the papercuts I\u2019ve done definitely helped out.\nI\u2019m so happy! Math isn\u2019t nearly as hard as they\u2019re always saying it is\u2014it\u2019s actually pretty interesting.\nEntry #197\nA lot of people say that math gets harder after 6th grade. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard at all, it\u2019s just that the calculations have gotten more complex.\nLike yesterday, when we studied the Theorem of the Opposite and Adjacent: In a given right-angled triangle the sum of the two legs squared is equal to hypotenuse raised to s. S is an abbreviation for the natural constant of the Opposite and the Adjacent, which is approximately 2.013. Ancient mathematicians had already accurately calculated s to the 28th place over a thousand years ago!\nYou don\u2019t need to be so exact though, \u2018cause 2.013 is good enough for most things. That\u2019s what our teacher said.\nStill, it\u2019s really tough to calculate the value of something raised to the power of 2.013 (or to find the square of 2.013). Since starting 6th grade every problem usually takes a couple of hours and I feel like most of that time is used for complex operations involving exponents.\nSometimes I think about how much easier everything would be if s was equal to 2! That way you could find the answer to these problems in seconds, not hours.\nEntry #248\n\u201cPractice making squares and finding roots until you know the operations like the back of your hand.\u201d I remember my teacher saying this over and over when I was little, but I feel like I\u2019m only just starting to understand what he meant.\nThere probably isn\u2019t one single lousy branch of science that that doesn\u2019t use them. In equations for falling bodies, the inverse square of gravity to distance is 2.07; the inverse square of an electromagnetic field to distance 3.02; and energy is of course equal to mass times the speed of light raised to the power of 2.03 . . . it all makes me tired just thinking about it.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how exciting or interesting a science may be, because in the end you\u2019ll inevitably get stuck doing dull and tedious calculations.\nEntry #335\nWithout meaning to, I\u2019ve discovered something pretty weird.\nI really like making papercuts\u2014it\u2019s something I\u2019ve enjoyed since I was a little kid. So yesterday, I took out a square piece of paper and started playing around with it. First, I cut a small square from the very center of the paper. That left me four right triangles. Originally I had been planning on trying to fit the pieces together into the shape of a spaceship, with the four triangles acting as wings. As I looked at the pieces of paper on the table, however, I was suddenly struck with a passing thought.\nIf the area of the original square piece of paper I had started with was equal to all of the small pieces that were left over, and the area of a square was the product of one side squared . . . why did something seem wrong here?\nWriting out a rough equation, I did my best to simplify it, until I was left with this amazing conclusion:\na2+b2=c2\nThere\u2019s no 2.013 after all! Just two!\nIt\u2019s a really weird result, I know, and pretty shocking too. But, I have to admit I\u2019m kind of in love with how simple my formula is and my gut is telling me that this is the true form of the Theorem of the Opposite and the Adjacent.\nEntry #336\nWell, it looks like that was a waste of time.\nI went to meet my math teacher today to explain my formula. Hoping for the best, I waited for him to look as surprised as I had been, and then maybe say something like, \u201cMy word! It really is true!\u201d I was pretty disappointed, though, cause he just laughed and shook his head.\n\u201cIncorrect.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s incorrect about it?\u201d\n\u201cYour formula for calculating the area is wrong,\u201d he said, patting me on the head. After a pause, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re a smart cookie\u2014you\u2019ve come up with a simple way to deduce the Theorem of the Opposite and the Adjacent. It\u2019s too bad because\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t area the product of length times width though?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just an approximation. While it\u2019s true that introductory texts explain it this way, once you enter the higher grades you\u2019ll find out that in addition to the length times width, there is an additional factor that must be applied to create the correct result. That\u2019s the true formula for area!\u201d\nHe\u2019s right, of course, I should have thought of this earlier. Since when have things ever been easy?\nSo depressing. When I got home and saw the cut up pieces of paper on the table I didn\u2019t waste any more time messing around with them.\nEntry #1129\nSoon I\u2019ll be signing up for the higher academy, where I\u2019ve decided I\u2019ll apply to become an astronaut.\nI still remember when I was a teen all I wanted was to be a scientist. But when I think about science now, all I feel is, well, a headache. I\u2019ve found scientific formulas to be, pretty much without exception, complex and tedious to complete\u2014or to put it another way, they\u2019re freaking irritating. But that\u2019s the world we live in, built on the foundation of an irrational, aesthetically unpleasing constant. Sometimes I think that if God really exists, then he\u2019s one lousy craftsman.\nEntry #2983\nMy vessel has already left the belt system, a pioneering first in the history of my people! When my messages and survey data finally reach the home planet three months from now I can only imagine they'll be filled with pride at my accomplishment.\nMeanwhile, I continue forward, seeking out places as yet unexplored by any who have come before.\nEntry #3012\nSomething very strange has happened.\nSome days ago, a crack appeared in my vessel\u2019s main cabin. The atmospheric sensor quickly found the leak in an out of the way corner. I carefully patched the crack, thinking that would be that.\nSince then, though, it\u2019s been one non-stop emergency. It\u2019s like my ship is being crushed, with compressions and fractures appearing all over the place. Fixing the cracks keeps me up at all hours, but none of it makes any sense. Where, in the vastness of space, is this mysterious pressure coming from to bear down upon my vessel?\nA number of sensors and engines in the craft have begun to malfunction as well, with obvious cracks appearing in the hardened alloys of the various components. Every day I fall asleep to a symphony of creaks and groans echoing out of some new, unknown corner of my vessel, as if I\u2019m living in a haunted house. There\u2019s absolutely no way for me to fall asleep without taking sedatives.\nEarlier today I discovered that even the gravitational sensors have begun to fail. When an asteroid of about thirty tons happened to pass by the nose of my ship I was completely unable to get the gravitational data supplied by the sensor to agree with the telemetric calculations of the ship\u2019s computer.\nI really don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep going like this.\nEntry #3028\nI think I\u2019ve discovered the source of the problem.\nHaving spent the last day combing through yesterday\u2019s gravitational data, I found something strange. If the numbers provided are correct, the inverse square of gravity to distance should be 2.\nUsing the principle of the interference on polarized light, I was able to measure the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle. The shortest leg opposite the hypotenuse was 3 units in length, to the adjacent leg\u2019s 4 units. The hypotenuse, meanwhile, was 5 units long!\nGiven an acceptable experimental margin of error, the hypotenuse was exactly 5 units in length, being neither slightly longer nor slightly shorter as one would have expected.\nEntry #3084\nI\u2019ve become certain I won\u2019t be able to keep my vessel together much longer.\nThe whole ship is coming apart now. Even if I were to return to my home planet immediately there would be no way for me to land without killing myself.\nAnd it\u2019s all because of the Theorem of the Opposite and the Adjacent\u2014it\u2019s true, a single formula is to blame for everything that's happening. The great pieces of metal that shape the hull, the precise and exacting components of my instruments\u2014they were all constructed and assembled according to the natural constant 2.013. But now even the natural laws are no longer what they once were.\nI\u2019m not afraid\u2014in all honesty, I\u2019ve made peace with this whole mess. You might even say I\u2019m a little happy. It\u2019s how the Theorem of the Opposite and the Adjacent was meant to be all along, isn\u2019t it?\nAnd now I\u2019ve found my way into a more beautiful universe where I can my lay my head to rest, having arrived at long last . . .\n\u201cI\u2019m curious . . . How in the world did they come up with such a strange version of the Pythagorean theorem?\u201d I asked, sighing as I set down the the printout of the translated journal.\n\u201cIndeed. I suspect it was on account of wormhole K09,\u201d Gu He replied, searching the database. \u201cIt just so happens that a medium-sized wormhole is located just outside their star system. Within the radius of its influence, space and time are slightly distorted.\u201d\n\u201cBut are we really supposed to believe that they never suspected all of those so-called \u2018natural constants\u2019? Imagine, raising something to a bizarre number like the power of 2.013! It looks so funny!\u201d\n\u201cAs a wise man once said, \u2018Living as I do on Lushan mountain, truly, I know nothing of its appearance from afar!\u2019\u201d Gu He said, sighing. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t try to judge their intelligence from our own perspective\u2014who knows, human civilization on Earth probably developed under the influence of an even greater distortion in time and space! Doesn\u2019t pi being 3.1416 strike you as equally odd?\u201d\nSuddenly speechless, I had nothing to say.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Micro SF, December 2014.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nLiu Yang has a PhD in physics and is a professor at Xi'an University of Technology.

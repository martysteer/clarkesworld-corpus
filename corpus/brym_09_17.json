We must choose for ourselves!\u201d\n The flock around me titters and clucks\u2014as though any of us are genetically human anymore\u2014and as Security lugs her off, I join them. I don\u2019t laugh at her politics. Sure, the Masters have deceived us. I laugh because she\u2019s in black and singing, and getting put away seems a silly way of fixing things. The Blackbirds are all song and dance.\n Humanity\u2019s willingness to be deceived is our biggest weakness, or so the Makers\u2014they who made me in their hidden glacier laboratories in Aotearoa\u2019s Southern Alps\u2014insist, and I reckon they\u2019re right. We want to believe that everyone else\u2019s just like us. Massive error of judgment, that. Trust\u2019s a shocking illusion.\n And see, I\u2019m all about camouflage. Name\u2019s Nick; Nikau Matukutureia. I stand alone and hidden, like my family\u2019s namesake the extinct Matuku heron of my homeland. Only, I refuse to let my kind die out.\n Alone, well . . . except for Charlie. I\u2019m human enough to love, and boy, does it keep me awake at night. And I don\u2019t mean sex, or at least, not much. We\u2019ve slept apart for months. Fights and love, beliefs and doubts. See, Masters? That\u2019s human.\n When we were first caged into First Station, six or seven hundred kilometers southwest of the Mawson grasslands by tube train into the high tundra of East Antarctica, I couldn\u2019t answer my doubts. Nothing\u2019s changed, there, but I am my purpose . . . and in that, I\u2019m hardly human at all.\n Much like my kids. Their boredom jangles, squelched in the back of my mind. They\u2019re why everything\u2019s here, so off I go\u2014to teach them.\n CHARLIE\n The masculine-smelling warmth in the positive-pressure rush of air from our unit drives me to tears for the third time this week. Only six weeks into our three-year contract, and I\u2019m out of energy for quarrelling.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happened this time, chook?\u201d Nick asks as he rolls from the lounge like a predatory boulder. I don\u2019t know if I love or hate it when he calls me that, and he knows it. Yet he clicks on the kettle, and I do need a coffee.\n My half-numb fingers tingle as they rip the velcro seals of my almost-familiar jumper-onesie. \u201cThey hate me,\u201d I half-blubber, but it isn\u2019t true\u2014my children are, well . . . they\u2019re different. There are no normal eight year olds here. Knowing what they are makes me doubt my instincts, and as I shimmy free of the onesie, I judge myself unworthy, again. \u201cWhy am I here?\u201d I ask, as if asking might bring clarity. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d\n \u201cWe came because we had to,\u201d Nick says, smooth brown skin crinkling around his wry smile. I wish I had even a fraction of his confidence and equanimity. \u201cThe Board, and all that, eh?\u201d\n \u201cNot that,\u201d I say, scrambling for any footing at all. I jam my onesie beside his over the drying frame and thrust a black-lacquered fingernail at our tiny living room\u2019s single window. The little perspex circle stares out across First Station\u2019s transparent tensegrity dome, and glares a white-cold light all day and all night. Antarctic midsummer has everyone wrung out. Humans need dark for sleep, and the curtain ban is an abuse of our rights\u2014as is the lack of space. Even our tiny high-rise Melbourne studio had been larger. \u201cI mean, people. Here, in bloody Antarctica!\u201d\n \u201cWe were here before them,\u201d Nick points out. \u201cNot so many of us, hey, but we were here. You know, Mawson, Davis, Casey, Amundsen, those Russian and Chinese bases. People have been here for ages.\u201d\n I make a rude noise, then wrestle a box for a tissue for my dripping nose. \u201cHear about today?\u201d\n \u201cEh?\u201d\n \u201cAnother Blackbird, in the square!\u201d\n \u201cOh, her. Yeah. Saw her taken down. Nuts, eh?\u201d\n \u201cGod.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI wish we were going home.\u201d\n \u201cWhat, Melbourne?\u201d He scratches his cropped curls and tattooed scalp as he nears. \u201cYou hated the city.\u201d His strong hands rest too heavily on my shoulders. Does he feel the swellings growing there? Yet his chest is safe and muscular against my face, and he smells sweet and fruity. I\u2019ve never smelled anyone like Nick, and never met anyone like him either. He\u2019s my rock . . . and just as impenetrable. \u201cGive it time, hey? It\u2019s not easy, what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d\n I scoff, thinking of the faraway looks he gets. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, Mr. Exercise.\u201d\n \u201cRunning\u2019s good for stress. Hey! Why not come with me?\u201d He flexes his arms, squashing my tender back.\n \u201cOi!\u201d I squeak, but I\u2019ve nowhere to flinch to. \u201cMe? With you? On these little legs? You might as well go walking.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s okay, eh, but. I\u2019ll just go for a run, after.\u201d\n With a chuckle he lets me go, and we each carry our secrets to our separate spaces. He buries himself in a book. I sip an awful station coffee in bed while streaming dumb vids, trying to fit my aching shoulder-blade nubs into the rut I\u2019ve dug in my life.\n NIKAU\n Every day before breakfast and after Charlie\u2019s class, something like dawn and dusk in lower latitudes, I strip to shorts and joggers and fly around the one-and-a-half-kilometer circumference of First station. From the transparent insulation there\u2019s my recreation track running through the landscaped space around the dome\u2019s structural trusses and cables, then the vehicular track\u2014the indirect route between the station\u2019s two triple-gated entrances\u2014then the buildings. Sometimes there\u2019s other exercise-mad people on the path, both hybrids and normals, and around them I keep it relaxed, do maybe four laps\u2014that\u2019s play. But when I\u2019m alone, like today, it\u2019s sprint time.\n Sprints . . . they\u2019re work. Four-truss lengths, two hundred and eighty meters flights\u2014each burning my legs and opening my engineered skin pores.\n Between sprints I catch my breath in carefully chosen sites\u2014away from cameras and busy areas, where the dome\u2019s gray-painted steel trusses anchor in flexion points. Must look strange, me rubbing my bare back and shoulders against the cold steel. It\u2019s more fridge than freezer, though, and my sweat\u2019s pretty sticky. My chosen sites are gumming over anyway, layers forming a latex as the Makers had designed. So, almost done, hey.\n Work. My kids are in gym, enjoying ball-play. Their foreign emotions leave me feeling trapped in my own head. Charlie\u2019s been acting caged for weeks. The dome arcs over us like a snare, like one of my ancestors\u2019 bird-catching basket nets.\n I\u2019m M\u0101ori, a warrior. Is this a war? Have the Makers made me unworthy of my ancestry? When I die, will my spirit fly to Hawaiki? Or to heaven? By then, I reckon I won\u2019t care much about any of it.\n CHARLIE\n This is all normal, I remind myself, but the children\u2019s expressionless moon-faces, blotchy with black-headed pimples with the onset of their Coming, don\u2019t look terribly normal. Normal, maybe, for them.\n Today I led my class out onto the roof of the education building, five floors above the vegetable patch. I\u2019d wondered if the heating inside was too warm for whatever they had done to the children\u2019s metabolisms. God knows I have trouble thinking when I\u2019m too warm. Nick laughed at the idea, but he loves sweat and heat. Me, I need a breeze\u2014even the gentle regulated vortex inside the dome. Yet despite the cool, my children\u2019s faces remain unknowably blank.\n Teaching without feedback feels pointless, something like the silent avian whirlpool of gulls circling above the dome. The children are learning, or so they insist. Trust us. But it\u2019s as invisible to me as the thermal leakage under those seabirds\u2019 wings.\n Yet those gulls are freer than me. Why can\u2019t I leap from the rooftop and soar? I roll my aching shoulders, stretch my grafts against the confines of my clothing, and sigh. Keep on keeping on, Charlie. My sleeve flashes my lesson plan.\n I take a deep breath and wave the kids to the railing. \u201cOkay, children,\u201d I chirp. \u201cWho can show me where cabbages are growing?\u201d\n In a whisper of thermal nylon unitards, the children all point down at the long rows of big-leaved plants.\n Startled, I stammer, \u201cY\u2014Yes, that\u2019s right!\u201d My heart races. Emotion is good, and showing it is a part of my role: The children must understand humanity. \u201cWow, guys! That\u2019s great! What about carrots? Remember their leaves? Short and feathery, right? Where are the carrots growing?\u201d\n Vacant black eyes, and sinking, soul-sucking silence.\n NIKAU\n Charlie won\u2019t look at me through breakfast. I play with a teaspoon, watching her shovel cereal like she\u2019s starving. The stuff tastes okay, but with everything else the Makers engineered into me, couldn\u2019t they have included lactose tolerance?\n Her empty bowl gives way to her coffee, but she grimaces at the flecks of UHT floating atop it. \u201cGoing for a run?\u201d\n \u201cClass\u2019 got art . . . so, yeah. Probably just a jog.\u201d\n We\u2019re both still chewing on last night\u2019s argument. I get her frustration with her kids, but she won\u2019t accept my experience with my older class, and I can\u2019t share my lifetime of training in resisting them. \u201cBe patient,\u201d I\u2019d finally told her, after we were done shouting about dumb things like the state of our toilet and kitchen. \u201cThey\u2019re listening. Trust me, hey? This is a phase. They\u2019ll get over it soon. You\u2019ll see.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m right yet.\n It\u2019s all the Masters\u2019 mess. They\u2019re breeding conflict here, not peace. Humans becoming aliens, or maybe aliens becoming human? How can humanity\u2019s problems be solved like this? The Makers had bred me, too . . . but I\u2019m no system of incremental genocide.\n She drains her mug while scraping back her chair. \u201cI start in ten.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll clean up, chook.\u201d\n \u201cThanks,\u201d she says, but her eyes rake me like talons. She\u2019s thinking I\u2019ll put things away wrong again.\n \u201cOi,\u201d I call after her. \u201cWho knows? Maybe they\u2019ll Awaken today?\u201d\n She winces into her onesie, and doesn\u2019t bother sealing it before leaving.\n My teaspoon bends beneath my thumb. Fighting with Charlie clears doubts, but it hurts.\n Straightening the spoon distracts me, as does cleaning up. After, I sort teaching notes on my sleeve and check for the presence of any of them through my encrypted station worm. The Masters usually alert Control of their approach, and with my head in a mess, I\u2019d rather not risk facing one.\n In the back of my mind, paint squelches between half-furred fingers. It makes me angrier, and despite the few walkers about, my run becomes another sprint. My sweat latexes on the trusses feel warmer, scavenging traces of activators from the dome\u2019s atmosphere\u2014which means that my system\u2019s working. I\u2019ve days left, at most.\n Oi, Charlie, I\u2019m sorry. I should have known better than to fall in love.\n CHARLIE\n Several children have fuzz sprouting across their cheeks, now, even the girls. They\u2019re like little unshaven men on my classroom\u2019s gray linoleum.\n \u201cSo, can anyone name one of these rainforest animals?\u201d I ask their bland expressions. A bright human child half their age might have gushed over the projection on my learning wall, but these kids\u2019 slow-blinking black eyes reveal nothing, let alone comprehension. \u201cThis forest is in Asia, so these are Asian animals\u2014like we were learning about yesterday?\u201d\n Silence. One of the hairiest boys scritch-scratches his cheek.\n I stare, exasperated, then throw up my hands. \u201cOh, why do I bother? Do you lot even hear me?\u201d\n *Yes?* squeaks a little voice in my head. Another joins it, then another. The mental murmuring grows and swells until, in a single exultant chorus, the class declares, *We hear you, Ms. Blake!* I\u2019m falling off my chair, and they\u2019re jumping and dancing with pure delight on their bristly little faces.\n *I can hear you, too! And you!*\n *Wow!*\n *Hey, what about that new Park Robots last night\u2014*\n *Yes!* Impossibly, I remember a red cartoon robot doing a humorous dance. There\u2019s a strange mental giggle. *This is so great!*\n *Huh? What ball?*\n *Down-ball!* Words and impressions blend, somehow clearer than mere speech. *During break?*\n And with that, my children Awaken\u2014and I finally understand. They had said the children would not respond aloud, and that it might happen like this. Nick, too.\n The children\u2019s happiness is giddy, uncomplicated, and very human. When had I last known such joy? For a minute or two, I bask in it.\n Then I clap my hands. This is school, after all.\n \u201cChildren!\u201d The mental hurly-burly subsides, leaving me feeling alone. \u201cWell done, everyone. Shall we continue learning about rainforests?\u201d\n The children settle cross-legged\u2014only now, without planning or effort, they arrange themselves into a four-by-five grid. Twenty voices mumble together, *Yes, Ms. Blake.* Now that they are pushing it into my head, their eagerness astonishes me. I can feel it.\n *Tigers live in rainforests,* declares a girl\u2014Sophie.\n \u201cYes!\u201d I gush aloud. \u201cCan you show everyone?\u201d I\u2019d expected her to point, but instead her mental impression of a tiger flashes around the room in an instant. I tap my wall to activate the animation, and receive a satisfying, *Ooh.*\u201cVery good! Anyone else?\u201d\n *Ms. Blake?* Which pair of dark eyes is asking? *Why is your back hurting?*\n I hesitate, wondering how to answer. \u201cEven adults grow up,\u201d I say, and in my back, new muscles twitch and tingle to the spark of new neural connections.\n NIKAU\n I\u2019m halfway around my circuit, flight curtailed to jog by the Maintenance gardeners, when I see one of them.\n No warning pings or zaps, because I\u2019m in shorts\u2014but the dome\u2019s mostly clear of snow and I spot it on the permafrost.\n At a glance you can\u2019t pick a Master from a Maker. They\u2019ve the same shaggy white hair, the same stubby legs, the same truck-squashed faces. Big enough to stop a truck too, maybe half a ton, trudging like a drunken glacier. But hidden deep in its fur this Master\u2019s skinny arms would be wrapped in gloves, and the Makers disdain clothing.\n The blurry glimpse slams the bars of my mental birdcage. No illusion\u2019s better than the truth: I sweep panic aside with worry over Charlie and her children.\n Ahead, a Maintenance guy stiffens\u2014an instant before the Master pushes into my head. They\u2019re rude like that, even through foot-thick insulation, but you get used to it. I\u2019ve seen them holding four mental conversations at once; all, if you believe it, while sharing thoughts and impressions with the nearest of its kind.\n *EDUCATOR, YOU ARE TROUBLED?* Its alien thoughts feel like spaghetti might, to someone expecting a steak.\n \u201cOn schedule,\u201d I hear the Maintenance guy say.\n I slow to a walk, presenting a memory of last night\u2019s argument, a focused peek between the bars. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n *DISAGREEMENT WITH YOUR MATE.* Its statement comes tangled with disapproval. Makers and Masters both use disagreement like a dirty word. Maybe conflict feels rougher between shared heads, or maybe it\u2019s a hangover from the schism that divided their species\u2014whatever that had been. *RESOLUTION IMMINENT?*\n \u201cYes. We strive for commonality.\u201d They love phrases like that.\n *APPROPRIATE,* it judges. *CLARITY OF EXPRESSION PROMOTES HARMONY.*\n \u201cIt does,\u201d I agree.\n It pulls its thoughts and trundles off, shaking the ground . . . or maybe that\u2019s me. When I jog away in the opposite direction, my rhythm\u2019s off.\n My head feels besieged, like a P\u0101 of my ancestors making war against invading p\u0101keh\u0101 . . . but my struggle\u2019s almost over. The encapsulated bacteriophages that I\u2019ve been crapping into the dome\u2019s sewerage bioreactor have been doing their job, generating gaseous activators. The smell of them in the dome is stronger than I would have believed possible, so my sweat latexes must be near primed\u2014yet I don\u2019t dare check on them.\n Time\u2019s short, it\u2019s almost Charlie\u2019s knock-off time, and like a homing pigeon I fly home.\n CHARLIE\n After dismissing my excited kids early, I head home cross-dome, but there\u2019s a peculiar acrid chemical stink hanging in the air. The Maintenance guys are usually over-protective of our sealed environment, and I can\u2019t find any station updates on my sleeve, so for the hell of it\u2014maybe it\u2019s the cloud of painkillers I\u2019m on\u2014I sniff around like a biosecurity dog. Unsurprisingly, the smell\u2019s strongest around the bioreactor plant and vegetable garden, where the waste of four hundred people is processed for both power generation and fertilizer. That must pong sometimes.\n I take the long way home; amid the vegetation along the recreation track my writhing and shrugging doesn\u2019t look so strange. My burgeoning grafts cramp, outgrowing my clothes. I wish I could stretch them, but . . . they\u2019re not ready. I\u2019m not ready. And . . . Nick doesn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see him on the track, so I head home.\n The smell hasn\u2019t penetrated our apartment yet. As I twist out of my parka-onesie, I feel like I\u2019m floating.\n \u201cSomeone dropped one out there, eh?\u201d His voice startles me, but there he is stepping out of the bathroom, wet and muscular and naked but for a towel slung about his hips. He knuckles his short curls in the hallway mirror, and in the spotlight of afternoon sunshine through our window, his wing-like M\u0101ori tattoos shimmer and ripple across his back.\n My jaw drops and I\u2019m aroused for the first time in months . . . but what if he hates what I\u2019m becoming? His shoulder muscles are like a magnet to my fingers, moisture slick across the swirling designs. He winks at me in the mirror, then turns and captures my waist.\n \u201cOi, that\u2019s bright,\u201d he says, squinting over a sparkling grin. His hands slide down to cup my backside. \u201cWant to go . . . somewhere darker?\u201d\n \u201cMmm-hmm,\u201d I murmur, and stand on tiptoes to press my cheek against his. We rub noses, and kiss. I shiver, delighted, and then\u2014\n *Fudge, Fudge, call the judge,\n *Anna\u2019s having a baby.\n *Seth\u2019s going crazy.\n *Wrap it up in toilet paper,\n *Send it down the elevator.\n *What\u2019s it gonna be?\n *Boy, girl, triplets, alien\u2014* A tinkle of mental laughter, and then Sophie\u2019s in my mind, tangled in a skipping rope. I can\u2019t help it, I break off the kiss and giggle. Where\u2014how\u2014had they learned that game?\n Nick looks bemused. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cKids. How do I keep them out of my head, now?\u201d\n \u201cHa! Not easy, eh? They must love you.\u201d He picks me up, his towel flopping to the carpet. I replace it with my legs. \u201cKeeping busy\u2019s the trick.\u201d\n His jaw is half smooth and half-stubbly. \u201cSuppose you\u2019ll help with that?\u201d\n \u201cSure, chook.\u201d We kiss again, and he tugs down my suit\u2019s zip while backing us up. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n Then we\u2019re toppling onto his bed, aflutter, trilling with laughter and sensation, and I fall with him, atop him. My back prickles, old blood through new flesh.\n NIKAU\n Either I had answers, or I was fooling myself. Truth\u2019s mostly delusion and self-affirming ideology anyway, and I\u2019d been made for a reason. None of it matters much as Charlie makes love to me for the first time in months. She\u2019s had work done on her back, tender to my probing, and I keep clear. They\u2019re long and weird, but they\u2019re just flesh, her flesh. Flesh is all we are, all our ancestors ever were, just water and electricity wrapped in fat, carbohydrate, and protein. Yet, we\u2019re important, too. We are humans, trying to be as human as we can. In the end, humanity\u2019s always been best at serving itself.\n And it is the end, hey\u2014or, almost. Who knows how long we have? The threshold concentration could be days, hours, or mere minutes away. Tonight would be fitting, but tonight Charlie and I are one, yet not; so completely human. We\u2019re no Masters or Makers, or their strange children, all muddled in one another\u2019s heads. When humans die, we die alone.\n I smile as she shudders and comes. Her song is the sweetest sound in my forest. She flicks back her hair, grins, and\u2014\n Whump! An explosion rocks the dome. Something clatters to the tiles in our little bathroom.\n She jerks in my arms. \u201cWhat the\u2014? Was that an earthquake?\u201d\n \u201cReckon,\u201d I lie. Lying is very human. \u201cKind of felt like one, eh?\u201d\n \u201cBut aren\u2019t we plate-central\u2014?\u201d\n A second and third latex detonate, and the dome\u2019s structure succumbs to my body\u2019s fires. Something twangs and swooshes, a parachute-like sound, and a tremendous crashing echoes. I imagine tension and compression failing, crumpling metal bones and transparent insulation sloughing like scales off a deflating fish. Molten and frozen cage bars groan and heave, howling like angry gods battling across the sky. Everything shakes.\n I close my eyes against the children\u2019s pain and fear. I was never theirs. I am my own, the Makers\u2019, and Charlie\u2019s.\n She squawks as I hold her tight, whispering human words about love and freedom. Her wings\u2014what she\u2019s had grafted onto her back\u2014flail and slap, featherless, against my locked forearms. She is my M\u0101t\u0101t\u0101, my fernbird, who will guide my spirit\u2014if I have one\u2014to Hawaiki. My sweat hardens across our skins, and her struggles fan the bedsheets to smoldering.\n As our walls collapse I roll atop her. In the end I am not merely Matukutureia\u2014the vigilant bittern\u2014but also the Nikau, palm tree of my ancestors, giving shelter as the cold, bright night rushes in with purifying flame, blasting skin and hair and cotton.\n Maybe, I think\u2014and it is my last thought\u2014\n A.

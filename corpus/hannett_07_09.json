Gaslights incandesced from the base of the carnival booth, projecting the solar system\u2019s rotations onto the canvas dome above the crow\u2019s head. Light strobed into his eyes each time Jupiter completed a rotation, which did nothing to improve the crow\u2019s temper. He lifted an articulated wing to shade his eyes; when he dropped it a moment later, he saw a gawking crowd congregating on the midway, its collective attention captivated by the golden gear held steady in his beak.The midway\u2019s makeshift stalls had sprouted like rank weeds, hell-bent on doing damage before they were uprooted. As evening slid into pungent night, the carnival had colonised the city\u2019s neglected streets, transforming them with its garish gaslights and flea-bitten draperies. Tents had whorishly spread themselves along all surfaces, like the cheap skin show dames who plumped and corseted their wares in the fair\u2019s liminal spaces.Now the thoroughfare teemed with noxious odours, secreted by a horde of notorious bodies, all crammed into collapsible houses of ill-repute. The buildings supporting the carnival\u2019s crooked pavilions dripped constantly, as if a giant pig was spitted in the sky, its juices left to fall like fatty rain onto the scene below. By morning, discarded candy wrappers and flocks of shredded ticket stubs would papier-mach\u00e9 every tent, signpost, and tree, leaving archaeological layers of rubbish to congeal in the city\u2019s slime.This whole place reeks, thought the crow.\u201cForget cheap arcades with rubber-limbed benders! Forget dime museums, string-shows and flea powders! What y\u2019all need is to let off some STEAM! Step right up and have a FREE shot at this Foul Fowl! Sock him in the block and win a plethora of prizes!\u201dThe crow snorted as the sprocketed showman jangled out from behind a threadbare curtain. His stovepipe hat belched steam as he clanked over to the bally platform, which was girded in dusty organza. The showman\u2019s pliable tin shanks were clad in darted velour leggings; aluminium tails grafted onto his torso lent his outfit a certain panache, as far as tarnished suits go. Small beads of humidity or grease drip-dropped down his pockmarked cheeks and neck, watermarking the collar of his ruffled shirt with grey splashes. Leaning on a bamboo walking stick atop the dais, he surveyed his flock for a heartbeat. On the second beat, he raised a gloved hand to his breast and bowed like a courtly gentleman.\u201cRobin Marx, at your service,\u201d he said to rapt listeners, \u201con behalf of the Outdoor Amusement Business Association. That\u2019s right, folks\u2014you\u2019ve heard the rumours, and I\u2019m here to prove \u2019em true\u2014Robin Marx always gives the first shot for free! Win on that shot and the prize is yours! It\u2019s no sin to be a winner, my friends; so come and collect an easy dinner.\u201dRevellers were drawn to Marx\u2019s stall faster than you could say shine on spit. He had greased more than a few palms to score such a choice locale; his bird-show was the first thing people\u2019d see when they came in, set up as he was on the right-hand side of the midway, only two paces away from the carnival\u2019s main entrance. The showman smiled, and blessed the corruptible lot man as he surveyed his coffer-filling patch of turf.It was proving to be the prime location for shooting marks.Ladies and gents disembarked from a motley collection of dirigibles\u2014steam-powered and boiler-driven, with leather balloons or finest silk, depending on the owner\u2019s station\u2014directly outside Sideshow Alley\u2019s hastily erected plyboard fences. Two guineas were extracted from each heavy purse by way of an entrance fee; once inside, the gullible masses would sure as sugar leave a goodly portion of their remaining shillings to Robin Marx, proprietor and entrepreneur extraordinaire.Pockets jingling, Marx wove through the crowd as if he were the Lord Mayor hisself; winking at the ugly girls and pinching the cute ones\u2019 bottoms; shaking hands with the gents and slapping sharpies on the back as he progressed. In the midst of his campaigning, Marx made his way over to the crow\u2019s slowly orbiting perch.Night clung to the bird\u2019s mangy figure; his wings hung sodden tissue-like by his sides. The crow felt like a feathered showcase for their racket, a curio cabinet with an aching beak and flea-bitten wings. A cabinet that would do anything for a day off. He sighed, making sure not to knock the gear out of his beak as he did, and listened to the sideshow dames singing to their Johnnies:\u201c\u2014one fire burns out another\u2019s burning,One pain is lessen\u2019d by another\u2019s anguish;Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;One desperate grief cures with another\u2019s languish . . . \u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever sing like that, bird?\u201d Marx bent over and turned the ornate key jutting out of the orrery\u2019s bulbous base, and forced the slowing planets to rev into dazzling motion once more. The crow flapped his discontent. He growled down at the showman\u2019s oxidized head, much to the crowd\u2019s insipid delight. A mechanical band organ began to caterwaul across the thoroughfare, drowning out the crow\u2019s curses.\u201cAh,\u201d said Marx, pausing before giving the key a final firm twist, \u2018the only sound more haunting than the calliope is the music of money changing hands, my friend.\u2019 And with a pseudo-sincere wink to his partner, he turned on his heel and directed his attention to the burgeoning audience.Robin Marx hoisted his walking stick, jabbed it skyward to reinforce his ballyhoo. \u2018The winner of the day will get the key to the midway, straight from my two hands!\u2019 He flashed a large bank roll\u2014a carny roll, thought the crow, or I\u2019ll be buggered\u2014and made sure to expose the cash reward for only the briefest second before squirreling it away in his waistcoat pocket.\u201cGet the bird to release his bootlegged prize! Five pence a shot,\u201d the showman cried.The crow made sure to tilt his head as Marx worked the bally; the golden gear winked in the gaslight, catching more than one poor sap\u2019s eye. As his roost lifted him skyward, he scanned the faces milling in the throng below him. Tried to guess which unfortunate sucker would reveal hisself\u2014for it always was a bloke\u2014to be Marx\u2019s front-worker.Could be him, the crow thought, as a stocky gentleman in a bowler hat disembarked from a locomotive rickshaw and stepped onto the midway. But he changed his bet as the skin show dames peeled away from the shadows, snagging the bowler hat and its owner with their lurid insinuations. [\u201cMe they shall feel, while I am able to stand: and \u2019tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh,\u201d sang the dames down the way.] He\u2019ll be there for hours, the crow realised, or until his pockets (and other things) are sucked dry.Jupiter convulsed on its brass frame, lurching further upward. The crow over-compensated for this movement and pitched forward at a precarious angle. His tomfoolery earned a round of raucous laughter from the carnival anemones swaying on the polluted floor beneath him. As he regained his balance, he saw a frogman wobble his way out of the ale den four stalls down, ribbetting up his dinner and the keg of piss-weak beer he\u2019d consumed on a dare. Next door, a seedy-looking weasel in patched plus-fours emerged from the sky-grifter\u2019s tent. He slid across the frogman\u2019s spew, leaving a trail of putrid footsteps as he zigzagged his way up the noisy thoroughfare toward Robin Marx\u2019s stall.The weasel\u2019s shifty eyes didn\u2019t blink twice to see the team of spontaneously combusting phoenixes bouncing on rickety trampolines in the centre of the midway. His listless mouth didn\u2019t so much as twitch toward a smile, even when a row of constructs whirled a metallic dervish for his pleasure and coin. No, the weasel had the expression of a man on a mission. He had a job that wanted doing, just as sure as Old Cranker\u2019s sausages weren\u2019t stuffed with bona fide cud-chewer.That\u2019s him all right, the crow thought. That\u2019s the shill.He watched the weasel\u2019s stilted progress, humming a fiddley snippet one of the lads from Labrador had played while the caravan steam-rolled its way across barren plains the previous night. The crow tried to ignore the ornamental gear whose jagged spokes were doing their utmost to bash his beak into a less functional shape. Agonising moments passed; the crow\u2019s eyes began to water; his ears felt downright clogged with the midway\u2019s hubbub. Finally, the weasel stepped up and placed his grimy paws on the footprints Marx had painted on the cobblestones, no more than spitting distance away from the crow\u2019s orrery.\u201cAl-a-ga-zam, capper. Give the crowd a wave, and tell us your name,\u201d said Marx in a voice as slick as the carnival\u2019s boulevards.\u201cTrouper,\u201d said the weasel.\u201cWell, Trouper, as I\u2019ve just been telling these here folk, this bird\u2019s a scoundrel of the nineteenth degree. That\u2019s right: this rotten crow is flaunting stolen merchandise in his good-for-nothing beak. He pinched that gear right out of my pappy\u2019s precious time-keeper\u201d\u2014he withdrew an unremarkable watch from his breast pocket and dangled it mid-air, just as he\u2019d seen hypnotists do\u2014\u201cand now it\u2019s ticked its last tock. Irreplaceable, that\u2019s what this piece is. You\u2019ve got to help me, Trouper! Help me get it back from that vicious crow so I can get my pappy\u2019s ticker started again!\u201dThe crow pretended to bow his head in shame at hearing Marx\u2019s accusations. He swept his wings up before him in a gesture of mock supplication\u2014his least favourite part of the act\u2014and in so doing deftly swapped the golden gear for a confectioner\u2019s imitation while Marx explained the rules of the game.\u201cThe first shot\u2019s always free, folks. Trouper, give it your best go. If you\u2019re a real lucky son-of-a-gun, you\u2019ll be the one to empty my purse after one sweet shot.\u201d As if of its own volition, Marx\u2019s hand stroked his waistcoat pocket while he spoke; and with each tender caress, the counterfeit bankroll bulged for all to see.The crow gripped Jupiter more tightly as the weasel drew a jacked-up slingshot out of his leather satchel. Trouper braced hisself. He cranked the miniature catapult until its arm was fully cocked and in assault position. He took aim, his furry finger extending toward the trigger on the slingshot\u2019s wooden handle, and fired. Across the midway, a group of girls squealed as their teetering seats topped the Ferris wheel\u2019s luminous peak; the crowd at Marx\u2019s stall gasped as the slingshot snapped into action with an ear-splitting crack of released carbon dioxide.The crow mimed he\u2019d been hit. He creaked his sooty wings around in comical circles, then swallowed the confectioner\u2019s gear with a tinny gulp. The orrery shuddered to a halt. From beneath cracked eyelids, he watched his performance drain dollar signs away from the sea of greedy faces beneath him. He chuckled as he righted hisself on his now-stalled perch.\u201cTake that, you old shit,\u201d he squawked at Marx, ruffling his oil-slick plumage. \u201cTry and get your precious gear now.\u201d\u201cYou see, folks? You see what pain he gives me? Please\u2014someone\u2014anyone\u2014step right up! Help me shut that miserable trap of his for good!\u201d Right on cue, the bird started wheezing, hacking and choking, reeling the crowd in with faux suffering. He covered his beak with a wing\u2014as all polite crows should do when they cough\u2014and replaced the dissolved candy gear with its golden counterpart. Beams of golden light twinkled out of the crow\u2019s mouth as the clean gear was reinstated, wedged between the upper and lower sections of his beak.The crowd fell quiet at Marx\u2019s feet. A chorus of accordions droned down the midway; coal-burners roared with delight as they powered bumper cars next door; whistles sporadically announced winners all across the carnival\u2019s crooked landscape; [\u201c\u2014yet I cannot choose but laugh, To think it should leave crying\u2014\u201d wafted out of the skin-tents]; but the group that had pressed in close to witness the crow\u2019s imminent demise was shocked into distrustful silence by the weasel\u2019s apparent failure, and the crow\u2019s derring-do.Venus chose that moment to add insult to the audience\u2019s injury. The rose-coloured globe, two prongs away from the crow\u2019s own Jupiter, flared on the orrery with a sudden brightness that blinded the already mute crowd, throwing the midway into unflattering relief. Yet when the yellow-blue afterimages faded from the spectators\u2019 eyes, their hands sprang together with gleeful applause. Tiny wind-up fireflies had escaped their Venusian cage: on Marx\u2019s command, they buzzed into formation, their minute bodies spelling out \u2019Golden Guinea\u2019 in a bewitching message of fortune.\u201cNever fear, my friends. What did I tell you? Everyone\u2019s a winner at Robin Marx\u2019s.\u201d The showman beamed with feigned magnanimity from his position on the stall\u2019s counter. He released the hidden lever that had unleashed the automatic fireflies, and blew contented smoke rings from his hat as he coddled the ersatz pocket watch. \u201cYes, the crow\u2019s still a crook, but good Trouper here shook him up a good one, didn\u2019t he?\u201d Catcalls and wolf whistles punctuated general expressions of good humour in response.\u201cAnd as the Lady Venus wills, the Gentleman shall receive,\u201d Marx said. A newly-struck gold coin instantly appeared in Marx\u2019s hand, and disappeared just as quickly in Trouper\u2019s. The weasel snatched the throwaway as if it were the first and last coin he\u2019d ever see, then forced a retreat through the jostling herd now vying to knock the crow senseless.Mark after mark placed feet on painted footprints, squared their shoulders and threw\u2014but none seemed blessed with Trouper\u2019s luck. Children began throwing tantrums instead of projectiles. One sniveling whelp kicked up such a stink that Marx gave both boy and mother a few ducats to go and see the Marx Brothers\u2019 Rocket-Powered Penny Farthings. This one tactical freebie was all it took; a deluge of 5p\u2019s avalanched across the countertop, and into Marx\u2019s purse.More stones were launched the crow\u2019s way amid showers of minor coins; the first of these missed, but the latter staunchly met their target. \u201cSorry, matie,\u201d Marx said to one sour-breathed contestant, whose chest heaved against his sweat-soaked shirt after another pebble hurtled wide of its mark. \u201cYour robust bear-huggers are just too strong for this game! You threw that one so quick, I reckon an African cheeter couldn\u2019t have caught it.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, Marx. Give me a rehash. I\u2019ll slip you a free strudel next time you come past my bakery,\u201d said the blubbery man through his long mustachios. Marx walked behind the counter, tilted his bulk forward on the orrery\u2019s concealed pedals, and said, \u201cTell you what I\u2019ll do for you, matie: if you win on the next go, I\u2019ll give you back every penny you\u2019ve gambled. Guaranteed. Peg this wretched bird with all your impressive might and you\u2019ll have more dough than you could ever knead at that bakery of yours.\u201dMarx\u2019s tongue kept flappin\u2019 until he got his way; such smooth words never did the marks any good. Bitter smoke billowed from the street vendors\u2019 burners, following the losers home. Nightwatchmen changed shifts, grunting salutations and beating billies against enhanced meat-hooks, as adrenaline levels bloated the carnival\u2019s nihilistic avenues. [\u201cTo see now, how a jest shall come about!\u201d laughed the dancing girls, \u201cI warrant, an I should live a thousand years, I never should forget it\u2014\u201d] The disgruntled baker turned away from Marx\u2019s stall, stuffing his remaining two guineas into a ragged pocket. He nearly tripped over the fox wheeling its way up to the target.Dressed in a chrome yellow top hat and matching damask suit, the fox was a dapper fellow, every inch a gentleman. The spiked wheels of his wicker invalid\u2019s chair sought purchase on the midway\u2019s greasy cobblestones; they skidded nauseatingly, and moved forward at an inchworm\u2019s pace. No matter if it took until morning for his master to reach his goal, the fox\u2019s kettledrum construct would not interfere. Only when he was contentedly puffing away on a mahogany pipe, his wheeled chair jauntily parked on the scuffed painted footprints, did the housebot approach. He draped a Burberry rug across his master\u2019s immobile copper knees, tucking it gently between the chair\u2019s arms and the fox\u2019s atrophied hindquarters, then stood off to his left-hand side.The fox\u2019s eyes never wavered from their prize as he asked the bot to analyse the odds of his winning this game.A slender ticker tape chugged out of a slit beneath the construct\u2019s speaker box. He tore it against his serrated teeth, and passed the results over to his master. \u201cImmeasurably in your favour. As usual, Sir.\u201d\u201cHey there, cowboy.\u201d Marx rearranged his features until they imitated a passably charming grin. He released a burst of steam from his top hat as he spoke.The crow eyeballed the fox from his lofty perch. Those who balanced on wheels instead of legs were such simple targets. Weaker than children, and less confident. \u201cCome have a go,\u201d he said, flicking the gear to the corner of his beak and projecting his voice for all to hear. \u201cIn fact, what\u2019s say we give him TWO goes for free, on accounta his poorly condition? Don\u2019t that sound fair, Robin?\u201d he asked, seeking and receiving the showman\u2019s nod.The fox tapped his pipe on the chair\u2019s padded arm, watched its sticky contents combine with the sludge lazily seeping around his wheels. [\u201c\u2014let them measure us by what they will, We\u2019ll measure them a measure, and be gone. . . . \u201d] He flicked a shred of tobacco off his lap, and gently cleared his throat.\u201cIndeed, I will take two shots, as you\u2019ve so kindly offered, Mr Black,\u201d said the fox.It took a second for the crow to realise the fox was addressing him. Not \u2018bird\u2019, not \u2018jackdaw\u2019, not \u2018scoundrel\u2019, no. He was Mr. Black.The fox feigned interest in the kaleidoscopic projections whirling around Marx\u2019s tent while the crow fluffed and preened his feathers.Then he opened fire.\u201cShot the first: a question. How did such a magnificent creature\u2014genuine Corvus corone, pure flesh and bone, not a single enhancement\u2014how did such a miraculous being come to be shackled and used as a cyborg\u2019s lackey?\u201dThe crow spluttered, and nearly swallowed the gear in earnest.\u201cShot the second,\u201d the fox continued, undaunted. \u201cAn offer. Work for me.\u201dThe crow cocked his head, and waited for the punch line.\u201cLet me set the terms,\u201d said the fox, \u201cfor I am sure you will find them suitably appealing.\u201d\u201cFirst,\u201d he said, \u201cI will prohibit you from participating in any specimen of show\u2014even though it would be an absolute delight to hear your dulcet tones raised in song, Mr Black, old chap.\u201d\u201cBut, no. No singing today. Instead, I would like to employ your golden sense. What does Mr Marx pay you? Some flattering mirrors in front of which you might preen? Perhaps some chymical bird-feed?\u201dThe crow kept silent.[\u201cTrue, I talk of dreams,Which are the children of an idle brain,Begot of nothing but vain fantasy . . . \u201d]\u201cI will offer you a gentleman\u2019s fare, Mr Black,\u201d the fox continued, quietly. \u201cI am not interested in paying carny\u2019s fees for such a one as you are. Sneer all you like at the term, Mr Marx; you cannot deny that you have treated this dark angel as nothing more than a lowly carny.\u201d\u201cI need a partner, Mr Black, for a somewhat more lucrative . . . oh, let\u2019s call it a venture, shall we? Your guile, your cleverness, your wit: these are exactly the assets I need for this undertaking. You are far too intelligent for this braggart\u2019s show! In fact, the show\u2019s very success hinges on your intellect. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see you exchange the false gear with the real, earlier\u2014\u201d\u2014the crowd stirred, grumbled as they fondled their weightless pockets\u2014\u2014Marx fumed, \u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you, cowboy\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2014indeed without your finesse, there would be no Robin Marx! And how does he repay you? By tying you to a moldy planet and shoving a gear down your gullet?\u201d[\u201cAy, while you live, draw your neck out of the collar . . . \u201d]\u201cWhat horror will he perform next? Are you a crow, Mr Black? Or are you a soiled dove, blackened much as this city has been of late, by too many trips up Marx\u2019s sooty arse?\u201dThe paralytic\u2019s got a point, thought the crow.He spat the gear out, propelling it with fury, loosening his tongue to ingratiate hisself to his new employer. The crowd dispersed like exhaled smoke. [Ladies, dames, raised their voices, \u201d To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov\u2019d, thou runn\u2019st away . . . \u201d]The tiny gear negotiated a haphazard path across the cobblestones, before spinning to a halt at the housebot\u2019s burnished feet. Before Marx could shift his frame off the counter, the bot had dropped a silk handkerchief onto the gear, collected it, and polished it properly. Then he lifted his master\u2019s damask coattails, exposing the clockworks inset in his narrow russet back.Half of the works were still, while the other portion whirred out their quotidian functions. The bot gently laid the gear into the fox\u2019s lower back, and used his index finger to screw it into place.\u201cWhat do you want me to do, boss?\u201d asked the crow, his eagerness to escape the ramshackle orrery hanging like a painful chandelier from his brief question.\u201cWhy, you\u2019ve already done it, old chap,\u201d said the newly mobile fox as his lower legs sprang to life. \u201cYou really have done it!\u201d[\u201cO, Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\u201d]Yipping like a newborn pup, the fox switched his tail into overdrive. He sprang out of his redundant chair, blew the crow a grateful kiss as he sped past, fleeing the scene before he could get slicked.[\u201cWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\u201d chimed the sideshow dames as the Johnnies were ejected from their parlours. The women\u2019s laughter was harsh and raw.]Lisa L Hannett hails from Ottawa, Canada but now lives in Adelaide, South Australia\u2014city of churches, bizarre murders and pie floaters.

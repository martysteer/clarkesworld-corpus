She had been in the city of Shenzhen for a little over two hours but she figured she would worry about a job tomorrow. Everybody knew you could get a job in no time in Shenzhen. Jobs everywhere.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d a guy asked her.\n\u201cI am divorced,\u201d she said. She had always thought of herself as a person who would one day be divorced so it didn\u2019t seem like a big stretch to claim it. Staying married to one person was boring. She figured she was too complicated for that. Interesting people had complicated lives. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a job. But I do hip-hop, too\u201d she explained.\n\u201cHip hop?\u201d He was a middle-aged man with stubble on his chin who looked as if he wasn\u2019t looking for a job but should be.\n\u201cNot like Shanghai,\u201d she said. \u201cNot like Hi-Bomb. They do gangsta stuff which I don\u2019t like. Old fashioned. Like M.I.A.,\u201d she said. \u201cExcept not political, of course.\u201d She gave a big smile. This was all way beyond the guy. Jieling started the boombox. M.I.A. was Maya Arulpragasam, a Sri Lankan hip-hop artist who had started all on her own years ago. She had sung, she had danced, she had done her own videos. Of course M.I.A. lived in London, which made it easier to do hip hop and become famous.\nJieling had no illusions about being a hip hop singer, but it had been a good way to make some cash up north in Baoding where she came from. Set up in a plague-trash market and dance for yuan.\nJieling did her opening, her own hip hop moves, a little like Maya and a little like some things she had seen on MTV, but not too sexy because Chinese people did not throw you money if you were too sexy. Only April and it was already hot and humid.\nGe down, ge down,\nlang-a-lang-a-lang-a.\nGe down, ge down\nlang-a-lang-a-lang-a\nShe had borrowed the English. It sounded very fresh. Very criminal.\nThe guy said, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d she said, adding three years to her age, still dancing and singing.\nMaybe she should have told him she was a widow? Or an orphan? But there were too many orphans and widows after so many people died in the bird flu plague. There was no margin in that. Better to be divorced. He didn\u2019t throw any money at her, just flicked open his cellphone to check listings from the market for plague-trash. The plague-trash market was so big it was easier to check online, even if you were standing right in the middle of it. She needed a new cellphone. Hers had finally fallen apart right before she headed south.\nShenzhen people were apparently too jaded for hip hop. She made fifty-two yuan, which would pay for one night in a bad hotel where country people washed cabbage in the communal sink.\nThe market was full of second-hand stuff. When over a quarter of a billion people died in four years, there was a lot of second-hand stuff. But there was still a part of the market for new stuff and street food and that\u2019s where Jieling found the cellphone seller. He had a cart with stacks of flat plastic cellphone kits printed with circuits and scored. She flipped through; tiger-striped, peonies (old lady phones), metallics (old man phones), anime characters, moon phones, expensive lantern phones. \u201cWhere is your printer?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cAt home,\u201d he said. \u201cI print them up at home, bring them here. No electricity here.\u201d Up north in Baoding she\u2019d always bought them in a store where they let you pick your pattern online and then printed them there. More to pick from.\nOn the other hand, he had a whole box full of ones that hadn\u2019t sold that he would let go for cheap. In the stack she found a purple one with kittens that wasn\u2019t too bad. Very Japanese which was also very fresh this year. And only one hundred yuan for phone and three hundred minutes.\nHe took the flat plastic sheet from her and dropped it in a pot of boiling water big enough to make dumplings. The hinges embedded in the sheet were made of plastic with molecular memory and when they got hot they bent and the plastic folded into a rough cellphone shape. He fished the phone out of the water with tongs, let it sit for a moment and then pushed all the seams together so they snapped. \u201cWait about an hour for it to dry before you use it,\u201d he said and handed her the warm phone.\n\u201cAn hour,\u201d she said. \u201cI need it now. I need a job.\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cProbably okay in half an hour,\u201d he said.\nShe bought a newspaper and scallion pancake from a street food vendor, sat on a curb, and ate while her phone dried. The paper had some job listings, but it also had a lot of listings from recruiters. ONE MONTH BONUS PAY! BEST JOBS! and NUMBER ONE JOBS! START BONUS! People scowled at her for sitting on the curb. She looked like a farmer but what else was she supposed to do? She checked listings on her new cellphone. Online there were a lot more listings than in the paper. It was a good sign. She picked one at random and called.\nThe woman at the recruiting office was a flat-faced southerner with buckteeth. Watermelon picking teeth. But she had a manicure and a very nice red suit. The office was not so nice. It was small and the furniture was old. Jieling was groggy from a night spent at a hotel on the edge of the city. It had been cheap but very loud.\nThe woman was very sharp in the way she talked and had a strong accent that made it hard to understand her. Maybe Fujian, but Jieling wasn\u2019t sure. The recruiter had Jieling fill out an application.\n\u201cWhy did you leave home?\u201d the recruiter asked.\n\u201cTo get a good job,\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cWhat about your family? Are they alive?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother is alive. She is remarried,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cI wrote it down.\u201d\nThe recruiter pursed her lips. \u201cI can get you an interview on Friday,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFriday!\u201d Jieling said. It was Tuesday. She had only three hundred yuan left out of the money she had brought. \u201cBut I need a job!\u201d\nThe recruiter looked sideways at her. \u201cYou have made a big gamble to come to Shenzhen.\u201d\n\u201cI can go to another recruiter,\u201d Jieling said.\nThe recruiter tapped her lacquered nails. \u201cThey will tell you the same thing,\u201d she said.\nJieling reached down to pick up her bag.\n\u201cWait,\u201d the recruiter said. \u201cI do know of a job. But they only want girls of very good character.\u201d\nJieling put her bag down and looked at the floor. Her character was fine. She was not a loose girl, whatever this women with her big front teeth thought.\n\u201cYour Mandarin is very good. You say you graduated with high marks from high school,\u201d the recruiter said.\n\u201cI liked school,\u201d Jieling said, which was only partly not true. Everybody here had terrible Mandarin. They all had thick southern accents. Lots of people spoke Cantonese in the street.\n\u201cOkay. I will send you to ShinChi for an interview. I cannot get you an interview before tomorrow. But you come here at 8:00 am and I will take you over there.\u201d\nShinChi. New Life. It sounded very promising. \u201cThank you,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cThank you very much.\u201d\nBut outside in the heat, she counted her money and felt a creeping fear. She called her mother.\nHer stepfather answered. \u201cWei.\u201d\n\u201cIs ma there?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cJieling!\u201d he said. \u201cWhere are you!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m in Shenzhen,\u201d she said, instantly impatient with him. \u201cI have a job here.\u201d\n\u201cA job! When are you coming home?\u201d\nHe was always nice to her. He meant well. But he drove her nuts. \u201cLet me talk to ma,\u201d she said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d her stepfather said. \u201cI have her phone at work. But she\u2019s not home, either. She went to Beijing last weekend and she\u2019s shopping for fabric now.\u201d\nHer mother had a little tailoring business. She went to Beijing every few months and looked at clothes in all the good stores. She didn\u2019t buy in Beijing, she just remembered. Then she came home, bought fabric and sewed copies. Her stepfather had been born in Beijing and Jieling thought that was part of the reason her mother had married him. He was more like her mother than her father had been. There was nothing in particular wrong with him. He just set her teeth on edge.\n\u201cI\u2019ll call back later,\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cWait, your number is blocked,\u201d her stepfather said. \u201cGive me your number.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know it yet,\u201d Jieling said and hung up.\nThe New Life company was a huge, modern looking building with a lot of windows. Inside it was full of reflective surfaces and very clean. Sounds echoed in the lobby. A man in a very smart gray suit met Jieling and the recruiter and the recruiter\u2019s red suit looked cheaper, her glossy fingernails too red, her buckteeth exceedingly large. The man in the smart gray suit was short and slim and very southern looking. Very city.\nJieling took some tests on her math and her written characters and got good scores.\nTo the recruiter, the human resources man said, \u201cThank you, we will send you your fee.\u201d To Jieling he said, \u201cWe can start you on Monday.\u201d\n\u201cMonday?\u201d Jieling said. \u201cBut I need a job now!\u201d He looked grave. \u201cI . . . I came from Baoding, in Hebei,\u201d Jieling explained. \u201cI\u2019m staying in a hotel, but I don\u2019t have much money.\u201d\nThe human resources man nodded. \u201cWe can put you up in our guesthouse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can deduct the money from your wages when you start. It\u2019s very nice. It has television and air conditioning, and you can eat in the restaurant.\u201d\nIt was very nice. There were two beds. Jieling put her backpack on the one nearest the door. There was carpeting, and the windows were covered in gold drapes with a pattern of cranes flying across them. The television got stations from Hong Kong. Jieling didn\u2019t understand the Cantonese, but there was a button on the remote for subtitles. The movies had lots of violence and more sex than mainland movies did\u2014like the bootleg American movies for sale in the market. She wondered how much this room was. Two hundred yuan? Three hundred yuan?\nJieling watched movies the whole first day, one right after another.\nOn Monday she began orientation. She was given two pale green uniforms, smocks and pants like medical people wore, and little caps, and two pairs of white shoes. In the uniform she looked a little like a model worker\u2014which is to say that the clothes were not sexy and made her look fat. There were two other girls in their green uniforms. They all watched a DVD about the company.\nNew Life did biotechnology. At other plants they made influenza vaccine (on the screen were banks and banks of chicken eggs) but at this plant they were developing breakthrough technologies in tissue culture. It showed many men in suits. Then it showed a big American store and explained how they were forging new exportation ties with the biggest American corporation for selling goods, Wal-Mart. It also showed a little bit of an American movie about Wal-Mart. Subtitles explained how Wal-Mart was working with companies around the world to improve living standards, decrease CO2 emissions, and give people low prices. The voice narrating the DVD never really explained the breakthrough technologies.\nOne of the girls was from way up north, she had a strong Northern way of talking.\n\u201cHow long are you going to work here?\u201d the northern girl asked. She looked as if she might even have some Russian in her.\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting married,\u201d the northern girl confided. \u201cAs soon as I make enough money, I\u2019m going home. If I haven\u2019t made enough money in a year,\u201d the northern girl explained, \u201cI\u2019m going home anyway.\u201d\nJieling hadn\u2019t really thought she would work here long. She didn\u2019t know exactly what she would do, but she figured that a big city like Shenzhen was a good place to find out. This girl\u2019s plans seemed very . . . country. No wonder Southern Chinese thought Northerners had to wipe the pig shit off their feet before they got on the train.\n\u201cAre you Russian?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the girl. \u201cI\u2019m Manchu.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Jieling said. Manchu like Manchurian. Ethnic Minority. Jieling had gone to school with a boy who was classified as Manchu, which meant that he was allowed to have two children when he got married. But he had looked Han Chinese like everyone else. This girl had the hook nose and the dark skin of a Manchu. Manchu used to rule China until the Communist Revolution (there was something in-between with Sun Yat-Sen but Jieling\u2019s history teachers had bored her to tears.) Imperial and countrified.\nThen a man came in from Human Resources.\n\u201cThere are many kinds of stealing,\u201d he began. \u201cThere is stealing of money or food. And there is stealing of ideas. Here at New Life, our ideas are like gold, and we guard against having them stolen. But you will learn many secrets, about what we are doing, about how we do things. This is necessary as you do your work. If you tell our secrets, that is theft. And we will find out.\u201d He paused here and looked at them in what was clearly intended to be a very frightening way.\nJieling looked down at the ground because it was like watching someone overact. It was embarrassing. Her new shoes were very white and clean.\nThen he outlined the prison terms for industrial espionage. Ten, twenty years in prison. \u201cChina must take its place as an innovator on the world stage and so must respect the laws of intellectual property,\u201d he intoned. It was part of the modernization of China, where technology was a new future\u2014Jieling put on her \u2018I am a good girl\u2019 face. It was like politics class. Four modernizations. Six goals. Sometimes when she was a little girl, and she was riding behind her father on his bike to school, he would pass a billboard with a saying about traffic safety and begin to recite quotes from Mao. The force at the core of the revolution is the people! He would tuck his chin in when he did this and use a very serious voice, like a movie or like opera. Western experience for Chinese uses. Some of them she had learned from him. All reactionaries are paper tigers! she would chant with him, trying to make her voice deep. Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory! And then she would start giggling and he would glance over his shoulder and grin at her. He had been a Red Guard when he was young, but other than this, he never talked about it.\nAfter the lecture, they were taken to be paired with workers who would train them. At least she didn\u2019t have to go with the Manchu girl who was led off to shipping.\nShe was paired with a very small girl in one of the culture rooms. \u201cI am Baiyue,\u201d the girl said. Baiyue was so tiny, only up to Jieling\u2019s shoulder, that her green scrubs swamped her. She had pigtails. The room where they worked was filled with rows and rows of what looked like wide drawers. Down the center of the room was a long table with petri dishes and trays and lab equipment. Jieling didn\u2019t know what some of it was and that was a little nerve-wracking. All up and down the room, pairs of girls in green worked at either the drawers or the table.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to start cultures,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cTake a tray and fill it with those.\u201d She pointed to a stack of petri dishes. The bottom of each dish was filled with gelatin. Jieling took a tray and did what Baiyue did. Baiyue was serious but not at all sharp or superior. She explained that what they were doing was seeding the petri dishes with cells.\n\u201cCells?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cNerve cells from the electric ray. It\u2019s a fish.\u201d\nThey took swabs and Baiyue showed her how to put the cells on in a zigzag motion so that most of the gel was covered. They did six trays full of petri dishes. They didn\u2019t smell fishy. Then they used pipettes to put in feeding solution. It was all pleasantly scientific without being very difficult.\nAt one point everybody left for lunch but Baiyue said they couldn\u2019t go until they got the cultures finished or the batch would be ruined. Women shuffled by them and Jieling\u2019s stomach growled. But when the lab was empty Baiyue smiled and said, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\nBaiyue was from Fujian. \u201cIf you ruin a batch,\u201d she explained, \u201cyou have to pay out of your paycheck. I\u2019m almost out of debt and when I get clear\u2014\u201d she glanced around and dropped her voice a little\u2014\u201cI can quit.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you in debt?\u201d Jieling asked. Maybe this was harder than she thought, maybe Baiyue had screwed up in the past.\n\u201cEveryone is in debt,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way they run things. Let\u2019s get the trays in the warmers.\u201d\nThe drawers along the walls opened out and inside the temperature was kept blood warm. They loaded the trays into the drawers, one back and one front, going down the row until they had the morning\u2019s trays all in.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Baiyue said, \u201cthat\u2019s good. We\u2019ll check trays this afternoon. I\u2019ve got a set for transfer to the tissue room but we\u2019ll have time after we eat.\u201d\nJieling had never eaten in the employee cafeteria, only in the Guest House restaurant, and only the first night because it was expensive. Since then she had been living on ramen noodles and she was starved for a good meal. She smelled garlic and pork. First thing on the food line was a pan of steamed pork buns, fluffy white. But Baiyue headed off to a place at the back where there was a huge pot of congee\u2014rice porridge\u2014kept hot. \u201cIt\u2019s the cheapest thing in the cafeteria,\u201d Baiyue explained, \u201cand you can eat all you want.\u201d She dished up a big bowl of it\u2014a lot of congee for a girl her size\u2014and added some salt vegetables and boiled peanuts. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good, although usually by lunch it\u2019s been sitting a little while. It gets a little gluey.\u201d\nJieling hesitated. Baiyue had said she was in debt. Maybe she had to eat this stuff. But Jieling wasn\u2019t going to have old rice porridge for lunch. \u201cI\u2019m going to get some rice and vegetables,\u201d she said.\nBaiyue nodded. \u201cSometimes I get that. It isn\u2019t too bad. But stay away from anything with shrimp in it. Soooo expensive.\u201d\nJieling got rice and vegetables and a big pork bun. There were two fish dishes and a pork dish with monkeybrain mushrooms but she decided she could maybe have the pork for dinner. There was no cost written on anything. She gave her danwei card to the woman at the end of the line who swiped it and handed it back.\n\u201cHow much?\u201d Jieling asked.\nThe woman shrugged. \u201cIt comes out of your food allowance.\u201d\nJieling started to argue but across the cafeteria, Baiyue was waving her arm in the sea of green scrubs to get Jieling\u2019s attention. Baiyue called from a table. \u201cJieling! Over here!\nBaiyue\u2019s eyes got very big when Jieling sat down. \u201cA pork bun.\u201d\n\u201cAre they really expensive?\u201d Jieling asked.\nBaiyue nodded. \u201cLike gold. And so good.\u201d\nJieling looked around at other tables. Other people were eating the pork and steamed buns and everything else.\n\u201cWhy are you in debt?\u201d Jieling asked.\nBaiyue shrugged. \u201cEveryone is in debt,\u201d she said. \u201cJust most people have given up. Everything costs here. Your food, your dormitory, your uniforms. They always make sure that you never earn anything.\u201d\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do that!\u201d Jieling said.\nBaiyue said, \u201cMy granddad says it\u2019s like the old days, when you weren\u2019t allowed to quit your job. He says I should shut up and be happy. That they take good care of me. Iron rice bowl.\u201d\n\u201cBut, but but,\u201d Jieling dredged the word up from some long forgotten class, \u201cthat\u2019s feudal!\u201d\nBaiyue nodded. \u201cWell, that\u2019s my granddad. He used to make my brother and me kowtow to him and my grandmother at Spring Festival.\u201d She frowned and wrinkled her nose. Country customs. Nobody in the city made their children kowtow at New Years. \u201cBut you\u2019re lucky,\u201d Baiyue said to Jieling. \u201cYou\u2019ll have your uniform debt and dormitory fees, but you haven\u2019t started on food debt or anything.\u201d\nJieling felt sick. \u201cI stayed in the guest house for four days,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said they would charge it against my wages.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Baiyue covered her mouth with her hand. After a moment, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d Jieling felt more frightened by that than anything else.\nInstead of going back to the lab they went upstairs and across a connecting bridge to the dormitories. Naps? Did they get naps?\n\u201cDo you know what room you\u2019re in?\u201d Baiyue asked.\nJieling didn\u2019t. Baiyue took her to ask the floor auntie who looked up Jieling\u2019s name and gave her a key and some sheets and a blanket. Back down the hall and around the corner. The room was spare but really nice. Two bunk beds and two chests of drawers, a concrete floor. It had a window. All of the beds were taken except one of the top ones. By the window under the desk were three black boxes hooked to the wall. They were a little bigger than a shoebox. Baiyue flipped open the front of each one. They had names written on them. \u201cHere\u2019s a space where we can put your battery.\u201d She pointed to an electrical extension.\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re the battery boxes. It\u2019s what we make. I\u2019ll get you one that failed inspection. A lot of them work fine,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cInside there are electric ray cells to make electricity and symbiotic bacteria. The bacteria breaks down garbage to feed the ray cells. Garbage turned into electricity. Anti-global warming. No greenhouse gas. You have to feed scraps from the cafeteria a couple of times a week or it will die, but it does best if you feed it a little bit every day.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alive?!\u201d Jieling said.\nBaiyue shrugged. \u201cYeah. Sort of. Supposedly if it does really well, you get credits for the electricity it generates. They charge us for our electricity use, so this helps hold down debt.\u201d\nThe three boxes just sat there looking less alive than a boombox.\n\u201cCan you see the cells?\u201d Jieling asked.\nBaiyue shook her head. \u201cNo, the feed mechanism doesn\u2019t let you. They\u2019re just like the ones we grow, though, only they\u2019ve been worked on in the tissue room. They added bacteria.\u201d\n\u201cCan it make you sick?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the bacteria can\u2019t live in people.\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cCan\u2019t live anywhere except in the box.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it makes electricity.\u201d\nBaiyue nodded.\n\u201cAnd people can buy it?\u201d\nShe nodded again. \u201cWe\u2019ve just started selling them. They say they\u2019re going to sell them in China but really, they\u2019re too expensive. Americans like them, you know, because of the no global warming. Of course, Americans buy anything.\u201d\nThe boxes were on the wall between the beds, under the window, pretty near where the pillows were on the bottom bunks. She hadn\u2019t minded the cells in the lab, but this whole thing was too creepy.\nJieling\u2019s first paycheck was startling. She owed 1,974 R.M.B. Almost four months salary if she never ate or bought anything and if she didn\u2019t have a dorm room. She went back to her room and climbed into her bunk and looked at the figures. Money deducted for uniforms and shoes, food, her time in the guesthouse.\nHer roommates came chattering in a group. Jieling\u2019s roommates all worked in packaging. They were nice enough, but they had been friends before Jieling moved in.\n\u201cHey,\u201d called Taohua. Then seeing what Jieling had. \u201cOh, first paycheck.\u201d\nJieling nodded. It was like getting a jail sentence.\n\u201cLet\u2019s see. Oh, not so bad. I owe three times that,\u201d Taohua said. She passed the statement on to the other girls. All the girls owed huge amounts. More than a year.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care?\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cYou mean like little Miss Lei Feng?\u201d Taohua asked. Everyone laughed and Jieling laughed, too, although her face heated up. Miss Lei Feng was what they called Baiyue. Little Miss Goody-goody. Lei Feng, the famous do-gooder soldier who darned his friend\u2019s socks on the Long March. He was nobody when he was alive, but when he died, his diary listed all the anonymous good deeds he had done and then he became a Hero. Lei Feng posters hung in elementary schools. He wanted to be \u201ca revolutionary screw that never rusts.\u201d It was the kind of thing everybody\u2019s grandparents had believed in.\n\u201cDoes Baiyue have a boyfriend?\u201d Taohua asked, suddenly serious.\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d Jieling said. It was against the rules to have a boyfriend and Baiyue was always getting in trouble for breaking rules. Things like not having her trays stacked by 5:00 p.m., although nobody else got in trouble for that.\n\u201cIf she had a boyfriend,\u201d Taohua said, \u201cI could see why she would want to quit. You can\u2019t get married if you\u2019re in debt. It would be too hard.\u201d\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried about your debt?\u201d Jieling asked.\nTaohua laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend. And besides, I just got a promotion, so soon I\u2019ll pay off my debt.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to stop buying clothes,\u201d one of the other girls said. The company store did have a nice catalogue you could order clothes from, but they were expensive. There was debt limit, based on your salary. If you were promoted, your debt limit would go up.\n\u201cOr I\u2019ll go to special projects,\u201d Taohua said. Everyone knew what special projects was, even though it was supposed to be a big company secret. They were computers made of bacteria. They looked a lot like the boxes in the dormitory rooms. \u201cI\u2019ve been studying computers,\u201d Taohua explained. \u201cBacterial computers are special. They do many things. They can detect chemicals. They are massively parallel.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cIt is hard to explain,\u201d Taohua said evasively.\nTaohua opened her battery and poured in scraps. It was interesting that Taohua claimed not to care about her debt but kept feeding her battery. Jieling had a battery now, too. It was a reject\u2014the back had broken so that the metal things that sent the electricity back out were exposed and if you touched it wrong, it could give you a shock. No problem, since Jieling had plugged it into the wall and didn\u2019t plan to touch it again.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Taohua said, \u201cI like it here a lot better than at home.\u201d\nBetter than home. In some ways yes, in some ways no. What would it be like to just give up and belong to the company? Nice things, nice food. Never rich. But never poor, either. Medical care. Maybe it wasn\u2019t the worst thing. Maybe Baiyue was a little . . . obsessive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about my debt,\u201d Taohua said serenely. \u201cWith one more promotion, I\u2019ll move to cadres housing.\u201d\nJieling reported the conversation to Baiyue. They were getting incubated cells ready to move to the tissue room. In the tissue room they\u2019d be transferred to protein and collagen grid that would guide their growth\u2014line up the cells to approximate an electricity generating system. The tissue room had a weird, yeasty smell.\n\u201cShe\u2019s fooling herself,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cLine girls never get to be cadres. She might get onto special projects, but that\u2019s even worse than regular line work because you\u2019re never allowed to leave the compound.\u201d Baiyue picked up a dish, stuck a little volt reader into the gel, and rapped the dish smartly against the lab table.\nThe needle on the volt gauge swung to indicate the cells had discharge electricity. That was the way they tested to see the cells were generating electricity. A shock made them discharge and the easiest way was to knock them against the table.\nBaiyue could sound very bitter about New Life. Jieling didn\u2019t like the debt, it scared her a little. But really, Baiyue saw only one side of everything. \u201cI thought you got a pay raise to go to special projects,\u201d Jieling said.\nBaiyue rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd more reasons to go in debt, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d\n\u201cHow much is your debt?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cStill seven hundred,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cBecause they told me I had to have new uniforms.\u201d She sighed.\n\u201cI am so sick of congee,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to let us get out of debt.\u201d Baiyue\u2019s way was doomed. She was trying to play by the company\u2019s rules and still win. That wasn\u2019t Jieling\u2019s way. \u201cWe have to make money somewhere else,\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cWe work six days a week.\u201d And Baiyue often stayed after shift to try to make sure she didn\u2019t lose wages on failed cultures. \u201cOut of spec,\u201d she said and put it aside. She had taught Jieling to keep the out of specs for a day. Sometimes they improved and could be shipped on. It wasn\u2019t the way the supervisor, Ms. Wang, explained the job to Jieling, but it cut down on the number of rejects, and that, in turn, cut down on paycheck deductions.\n\u201cThat leaves us Sundays,\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave compound this Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you do, what are they going to do, fire you?\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re supposed to earn money outside of the compound,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cYou are too much of a good girl,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cRemember, it doesn\u2019t matter if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.\u201d\n\u201cIs that Mao?\u201d Baiyue asked, frowning.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jieling said, \u201cDeng Xiaoping, the one after Mao.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s dead, too,\u201d Baiyue said. She rapped a dish against the counter and the needle on the voltmeter jumped.\nJieling had been working just over four weeks when they were all called to the cafeteria for a meeting. Mr. Cao from Human Resources was there. He was wearing a dark suit and standing at the white screen. Other cadres sat in chairs along the back of the stage, looking very stern.\n\u201cWe are here to discuss a very serious matter,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of you know this girl.\u201d\nThere was a laptop hooked up and a very nervous looking boy running it. Jieling looked carefully at the laptop but it didn\u2019t appear to be a special projects computer. In fact, it was made in Korea. He did something and an ID picture of a girl flashed on the screen.\nJieling didn\u2019t know her. But around her she heard noises of shock, someone sucking air through their teeth, someone else breathed softly, \u2018Ai-yah.\u2019\n\u201cThis girl ran away, leaving her debt with New Life. She ate our food, wore our clothes, slept in our beds. And then, like a thief, she ran away.\u201d The Human Resources man nodded his head. The boy at the computer changed the image on the big projector screen.\nNow it was a picture of the same girl with her head bowed, and two policemen holding her arms.\n\u201cShe was picked up in Guangdong,\u201d the Human Resources man said. \u201cShe is in jail there.\u201d\nThe cafeteria was very quiet.\nThe Human Resources man said, \u201cHer life is ruined, which is what should happen to all thieves.\u201d\nThen he dismissed them. That afternoon, the picture of the girl with the two policemen appeared on the bulletin boards of every floor of the dormitory.\nOn Sunday, Baiyue announced, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201d\nShe was not supposed to leave the compound, but one of her roommates had female problems\u2014bad cramps\u2014and planned to spend the day in bed drinking tea and reading magazines. Baiyue was going to use her ID to leave.\n\u201cYou have to,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou want to grow old here? Die a serf to New Life?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. We can\u2019t make money dancing in the plague-trash market.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve done it before,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not a good idea,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cBecause of the girl they caught in Guangdong. We\u2019re not skipping out on our debt. We\u2019re paying it off.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to work for someone else when we work here,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou are always making things sound worse than they are. I think you like staying here being little Miss Lei Feng.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d Baiyue snapped.\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t act like it. New Life is not being fair. We don\u2019t have to be fair. What are they going to do to you if they catch you?\u201d\n\u201cFine me,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cAdd to my debt!\u201d\n\u201cSo what? They\u2019re going to find a way to add to your debt no matter what. You are a serf. They are the landlord.\u201d\n\u201cBut if\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo but if.\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou like being a martyr. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Baiyue asked. \u201cYou like it here. If you stay you can eat pork buns every night.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you can eat congee for the rest of your life. I\u2019m going to try to do something.\u201d Jieling slammed out of the dorm room. She had never said harsh things to Baiyue before. Yes, she had thought about staying here. But was that so bad? Better than being like Baiyue who would stay here and have a miserable life. Jieling was not going to have a miserable life, no matter where she stayed or what she did. That was why she had come to Shenzhen in the first place.\nShe heard the door open behind her and Baiyue ran down the hall. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019ll try it. Just this once.\u201d\nThe streets of Shanghai were incredibly loud after weeks in the compound. In a shop window, she and Baiyue stopped and watched a news segment on how the fashion in Shanghai was for sarongs. Jieling would have to tell her mother. Of course her mother had a TV and probably already knew. Jieling thought about calling, but not now. Not now. She didn\u2019t want to explain about New Life. The next news segment was about the success of the People\u2019s Army in Tajikistan. Jieling pulled Baiyue to come on.\nThey took one bus, and then had to transfer. On Sundays, unless you were lucky, it took forever to transfer because fewer busses ran. They waited almost an hour for the second bus. That bus was almost empty when they got on. They sat down a few seats back from the driver. Baiyue rolled her eyes. \u201cDid you see the guy in the back?\u201d she asked. \u201cParty functionary.\u201d\nJieling glanced over her shoulder and saw him. She couldn\u2019t miss him, in his careful polo shirt. He had that stiff party-member look.\nBaiyue sighed. \u201cMy uncle is just like that. So boring.\u201d\nJieling thought that to be honest, Baiyue would have made a good revolutionary, back in the day. Baiyue liked that kind of revolutionary purity. But she nodded.\nThe plague-trash market was full on a Sunday. There was a toy seller making tiny little clay figures on sticks. He waved a stick at the girls as they passed. \u201cCute things!\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019ll make whatever you want!\u201d The stick had a little Donald Duck on it.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cThere\u2019s too many people.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Jieling said. She found a place for the boombox. Jieling had brought them to where all the food vendors were. \u201cStay here and watch this,\u201d she said. She hunted through the food stalls and bought a bottle of local beer, counting out from her little horde of money she had left from when she came. She took the beer back to Baiyue. \u201cDrink this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will help you be brave.\u201d\n\u201cI hate beer,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cBeer or debt,\u201d Jieling said.\nWhile Baiyue drank the beer, Jieling started the boombox and did her routine. People smiled at her but no one put any money in her cash box. Shenzhen people were so cheap. Baiyue sat on the curb, nursing her beer, not looking at Jieling or at anyone until finally Jieling couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.\n\u201cC\u2019mon, meimei,\u201d she said.\nBaiyue seemed a bit surprised to be called little sister but she put the beer down and got up. They had practiced a routine to an M.I.A. song, singing and dancing. It would be a hit, Jieling was sure.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Baiyue whispered.\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou do good.\u201d\nA couple of people stopped to watch them arguing, so Jieling started the music.\n\u201cI feel sick,\u201d Baiyue whimpered.\nBut the beat started and there was nothing to do but dance and sing. Baiyue was so nervous, she forgot at first, but then she got the hang of it. She kept her head down and her face was bright red.\nJieling started making up a rap. She\u2019d never done it before and she hadn\u2019t gotten very far before she was laughing and then Baiyue was laughing, too.\nWode meimei hen haixiude\nMei ta shi xuli\ntai hen xiuqi\u2014\nMy little sister is so shy\nBut she\u2019s pretty\nFar too delicate\u2014\nThey almost stopped because they were giggling but they kept dancing and Jieling went back to the lyrics from the song they had practiced.\nWhen they had finished, people clapped and they\u2019d made thirty-two yuan.\nThey didn\u2019t make as much for any single song after that, but in a few hours they had collected 187 yuan. It was early evening and night entertainers were showing up\u2014a couple of people who sang opera, acrobats, and a clown with a wig of hair so red it looked on fire, stepping stork-legged on stilts waving a rubber Kalashnikov in his hand. He was all dressed in white. Uncle Death, from cartoons during the plague. Some of the day vendors had shut down, and new people were showing up who put out a board and some chairs and served sorghum liquor; clear, white and 150 proof. The crowd was starting to change, too. It was rowdier. Packs of young men dressed in weird combinations of clothes from plague markets\u2014vintage Mao suit jackets and suit pants and peasant shoes. And others, veterans from Tajikistan conflict, one with an empty trouser leg.\nJieling picked up the boombox and Baiyue took the cash box. Outside of the market it wasn\u2019t yet dark.\n\u201cYou are amazing,\u201d Baiyue kept saying. \u201cYou are such a special girl!\u201d\n\u201cYou did great,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cWhen I was by myself, I didn\u2019t make anything! Everyone likes you because you are little and cute!\u201d\n\u201cLook at this! I\u2019ll be out of debt before autumn!\u201d\nMaybe it was just the feeling that she was responsible for Baiyue, but Jieling said, \u201cYou keep it all.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t! We split it!\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cThen after you get away, you can help me. Just think, if we do this for three more Sundays, you\u2019ll pay off your debt.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Jieling,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cYou really are like my big sister!\u201d\nJieling was sorry she had ever called Baiyue \u2018little sister.\u2019 It was such a country thing to do. She had always suspected that Baiyue wasn\u2019t a city girl. Jieling hated the countryside. Grain spread to dry in the road and mother\u2019s-elder-sister and father\u2019s-younger-brother bringing all the cousins over on the day off. Jieling didn\u2019t even know all those country ways to say aunt and uncle. It wasn\u2019t Baiyue\u2019s fault. And Baiyue had been good to her. She was rotten to be thinking this way.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d said a man. He wasn\u2019t like the packs of young men with their long hair and plague clothes. Jieling couldn\u2019t place him but he seemed familiar. \u201cI saw you in the market. You were very fun. Very lively.\u201d\nBaiyue took hold of Jieling\u2019s arm. For a moment Jieling wondered if maybe he was from New Life, but she told herself that was crazy. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She thought she remembered him putting ten yuan in the box. No, she thought, he was on the bus. The party functionary. The party was checking up on them. Now that was funny. She wondered if he would lecture them on Western ways.\n\u201cAre you in the music business?\u201d Baiyue asked. She glanced at Jieling who couldn\u2019t help laughing, snorting through her nose.\nThe man took them very seriously though. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help you there. But I like your act. You seem like girls of good character.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Baiyue said. She didn\u2019t look at Jieling again, which was good because Jieling knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep a straight face.\n\u201cI am Wei Rongyi. Maybe I can buy you some dinner?\u201d the man asked. He held up his hands. \u201cNothing romantic. You are so young, it is like you could be daughters.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a daughter?\u201d Jieling asked.\nHe shook his head. \u201cNot anymore,\u201d he said.\nJieling understood. His daughter had died of the bird flu. She felt embarrassed for having laughed at him. Her soft heart saw instantly that he was treating them like the daughter he had lost.\nHe took them to a dumpling place on the edge of the market and ordered half a kilo of crescent-shaped pork dumplings and a kilo of square beef dumplings. He was a cadre, a middle manager. His wife had lived in Changsha for a couple of years now, where her family was from. He was from the older generation, people who did not get divorced. All around them, the restaurant was filling up mostly with men stopping after work for dumplings and drinks. They were a little island surrounded by truck drivers and men who worked in the factories in the outer city\u2014tough grimy places.\n\u201cWhat do you do? Are you secretaries?\u201d Wei Rongyi asked.\nBaiyue laughed. \u201cAs if!\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are factory girls,\u201d Jieling said. She dunked a dumpling in vinegar. They were so good! Not congee!\n\u201cFactory girls!\u201d he said. \u201cI am so surprised!\u201d\nBaiyue nodded. \u201cWe work for New Life,\u201d she explained. \u201cThis is our day off, so we wanted to earn a little extra money.\u201d\nHe rubbed his head, looking off into the distance. \u201cNew Life,\u201d he said, trying to place the name. \u201cNew Life . . . \u201d\n\u201cOut past the zoo,\u201d Baiyue said.\nJieling thought they shouldn\u2019t say so much.\n\u201cAh, in the city. A good place? What do they make?\u201d he asked. He had a way of blinking very quickly that was disconcerting.\n\u201cBatteries,\u201d Jieling said. She didn\u2019t say bio-batteries.\n\u201cI thought they made computers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cSpecial projects.\u201d\nJieling glared at Baiyue. If this guy gave them trouble at New Life, they\u2019d have a huge problem getting out of the compound.\nBaiyue blushed.\nWei laughed. \u201cYou are special project girls, then. Well, see, I knew you were not just average factory girls.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t press the issue. Jieling kept waiting for him to make some sort of move on them. Offer to buy them beer. But he didn\u2019t, and when they had finished their dumplings, he gave them the leftovers to take back to their dormitories and then stood at the bus stop until they were safely on their bus.\n\u201cAre you sure you will be all right?\u201d he asked them when the bus came.\n\u201cYou can see my window from the bus stop,\u201d Jieling promised. \u201cWe will be fine.\u201d\n\u201cShenzhen can be a dangerous city. You be careful!\u201d\nOut the window, they could see him in the glow of the streetlight, waving as the bus pulled away.\n\u201cHe was so nice,\u201d Baiyue sighed. \u201cPoor man.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you think he was a little strange?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cEverybody is strange anymore,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cAfter the plague. Not like when we were growing up.\u201d\nIt was true. Her mother was strange. Lots of people were crazy from so many people dying. Jieling held up the leftover dumplings. \u201cWell, anyway. I am not feeding this to my battery,\u201d she said. They both tried to smile.\n\u201cOur whole generation is crazy,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cWe know everybody dies,\u201d Jieling said. Outside the bus window, the streets were full of young people, out trying to live while they could.\nThey made all their bus connections as smooth as silk. So quick, they were home in forty-five minutes. Sunday night was movie night, and all of Jieling\u2019s roommates were at the movie so she and Baiyue could sort the money in Jieling\u2019s room. She used her key card and the door clicked open.\nMr. Wei was kneeling by the battery boxes in their room. He started and hissed, \u201cClose the door!\u201d\nJieling was so surprised she did.\n\u201cMr. Wei!\u201d Baiyue said.\nHe was dressed like an army man on a secret mission, all in black. He showed them a little black gun. Jieling blinked in surprise. \u201cMr. Wei!\u201d she said. It was hard to take him seriously. Even all in black, he was still weird Mr. Wei, blinking rapidly behind his glasses.\n\u201cLock the door,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd be quiet.\u201d\n\u201cThe door locks by itself,\u201d Jieling explained. \u201cAnd my roommates will be back soon.\u201d\n\u201cPut a chair in front of the door,\u201d he said and shoved the desk chair towards them. Baiyue pushed it under the door handle. The window was open and Jieling could see where he had climbed on the desk and left a footprint on Taohua\u2019s fashion magazine. Taohua was going to be pissed. And what was Jieling going to say? If anyone found out there was a man in her room, she was going to be in very big trouble.\n\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat about the cameras?\u201d There were security cameras.\nHe showed them a little spray can. \u201cSpecial paint. It just makes things look foggy and dim. Security guards are so lazy anymore no one ever checks things out.\u201d He paused a moment, clearly disgusted with the lax morality of the day. \u201cMiss Jieling,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that screwdriver and finish unscrewing that computer from the wall.\u201d\nComputer? She realized he meant the battery boxes.\nBaiyue\u2019s eyes got very big. \u201cMr. Wei! You\u2019re a thief!\u201d\nJieling shook her head. \u201cA corporate spy.\u201d\n\u201cI am a patriot,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you young people wouldn\u2019t understand that. Sit on the bed.\u201d He waved the gun at Baiyue.\nThe gun was so little it looked like a toy and it was difficult to be afraid, but still Jieling thought it was good that Baiyue sat.\nJieling knelt. It was her box that Mr. Wei had been disconnecting. It was all the way to the right, so he had started with it. She had come to feel a little bit attached to it, thinking of it sitting there, occasionally zapping electricity back into the grid, reducing her electricity costs and her debt. She sighed and unscrewed it. Mr. Wei watched.\nShe jimmied it off the wall, careful not to touch the contacts. The cells built up a charge, and when they were ready, a switch tapped a membrane and they discharged. It was all automatic and there was no knowing when it was going to happen. Mr. Wei was going to be very upset when he realized that this wasn\u2019t a computer.\n\u201cPut it on the desk,\u201d he said.\nShe did.\n\u201cNow sit with your friend.\u201d\nJieling sat down next to Baiyue. Keeping a wary eye on them, he sidled over to the bio-battery. He opened the hatch where they dumped garbage in them, and tried to look in as well as look at them. \u201cWhere are the controls?\u201d he asked. He picked it up, his palm flat against the broken back end where the contacts were exposed.\n\u201cTap it against the desk,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cSometimes the door sticks.\u201d There wasn\u2019t actually a door. But it had just come into her head. She hoped that the cells hadn\u2019t discharged in awhile.\nMr. Wei frowned and tapped the box smartly against the desktop.\nTorpedinidae, the electric ray, can generate a current of two hundred volts for approximately a minute. The power output is close to 1 kilowatt over the course of the discharge and while this won\u2019t kill the average person, it is a powerful shock. Mr. Wei stiffened and fell, clutching the box and spasming wildly. One . . . two . . . three . . . four . . . Mr. Wei was still spasming. Jieling and Baiyue looked at each other. Gingerly, Jieling stepped around Mr. Wei. He had dropped the little gun. Jieling picked it up. Mr. Wei was still spasming. Jieling wondered if he was going to die. Or if he was already dead and the electricity was just making him jump. She didn\u2019t want him to die. She looked at the little gun and it made her feel even sicker so she threw it out the window.\nFinally Mr. Wei dropped the box.\nBaiyue said, \u201cIs he dead?\u201d\nJieling was afraid to touch him. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was breathing. Then he groaned and both girls jumped.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not dead,\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Baiyue asked.\n\u201cTie him up,\u201d Jieling said. Although she wasn\u2019t sure what they\u2019d do with him then.\nJieling used the cord to her boombox to tie his wrists. When she grabbed his hands he gasped and struggled feebly. Then she took her pillowcase and cut along the blind end, a space just wide enough that his head would fit through.\n\u201cSit him up,\u201d she said to Baiyue.\n\u201cYou sit him up,\u201d Baiyue said. Baiyue didn\u2019t want to touch him.\nJieling pulled Mr. Wei into a sitting position. \u201cPut the pillowcase over his head,\u201d she said. The pillowcase was like a shirt with no armholes, so when Baiyue pulled it over his head and shoulders, it pinned his arms against his sides and worked something like a straightjacket.\nJieling took his wallet and his identification papers out of his pocket. \u201cWhy would someone carry their wallet to a break in?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe has six ID papers. One says he is Mr. Wei.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cLet me see. Also Mr. Ma. Mr. Zhang. Two Mr. Liu\u2019s and a Mr. Cui.\u201d\nMr. Wei blinked, his eyes watering.\n\u201cDo you think he has a weak heart?\u201d Baiyue asked.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t he be dead if he did?\u201d\nBaiyue considered this.\n\u201cBaiyue! Look at all this yuan!\u201d Jieling emptied the wallet, counting. Almost eight thousand yuan!\n\u201cLet me go,\u201d Mr. Wei said weakly.\nJieling was glad he was talking. She was glad he seemed like he might be all right. She didn\u2019t know what they would do if he died. They would never be able to explain a dead person. They would end up in deep debt. And probably go to jail for something. \u201cShould we call the floor auntie and tell him that he broke in?\u201d Jieling asked.\n\u201cWe could,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cDo not!\u201d Mr. Wei said, sounding stronger. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand! I\u2019m from Beijing!\u201d\n\u201cSo is my stepfather,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cMe, I\u2019m from Baoding. It\u2019s about an hour south of Beijing.\u201d\nMr. Wei said, \u201cI\u2019m from the government! That money is government money!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cWhy did you come in through the window?\u201d\n\u201cSecret agents always come in through the window?\u201d Baiyue said and started to giggle.\n\u201cBecause this place is counter-revolutionary!\u201d Mr. Wei said.\nBaiyue covered her mouth with her hand. Jieling felt embarrassed, too. No one said things like \u2018counter-revolutionary\u2019 anymore.\n\u201cThis place! It is making things that could make China strong!\u201d he said.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that good?\u201d Baiyue asked.\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t care about China! Only about money. Instead of using it for China, they sell it to America!\u201d he said. Spittle was gathering at the corner of his mouth. He was starting to look deranged. \u201cLook at this place! Officials are all concerned about guanxi!\u201d Connections. Kickbacks. Guanxi ran China, everybody knew that.\n\u201cSo, maybe you have an anti-corruption investigation?\u201d Jieling said. There were lots of anti-corruption investigations. Jieling\u2019s stepfather said that they usually meant someone powerful was mad at their brother-in-law or something, so they accused them of corruption.\nMr. Wei groaned. \u201cThere is no one to investigate them.\u201d\nBaiyue and Jieling looked at each other.\nMr. Wei explained, \u201cIn my office, the Guangdong office, there used to be twenty people. Special operatives. Now there is only me and Ms. Yang.\u201d\nJieling said, \u201cDid they all die of bird flu?\u201d\nMr. Wei shook his head. \u201cNo, they all went to work on contract for Saudi Arabia. You can make a lot of money in the Middle East. A lot more than in China.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Ms. Yang go work on Saudi Arabia?\u201d Baiyue asked.\nJieling thought Mr. Wei would give some revolutionary speech. But he just hung his head. \u201cShe is the secretary. I am the bookkeeper.\u201d And then in a smaller voice, \u201cShe is going to Kuwait to work for Mr. Liu.\u201d\nThey probably did not need bookkeepers in the Middle East. Poor Mr. Wei. No wonder he was such a terrible secret agent.\n\u201cThe spirit of the revolution is gone,\u201d he said, and there were real, honest to goodness tears in his eyes. \u201cDid you know that Tiananmen Square was built by volunteers? People would come after their regular job and lay the paving of the square. Today people look to Hong Kong.\u201d\n\u201cNobody cares about a bunch of old men in Beijing,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cExactly! We used to have a strong military! But now the military is too worried about their own factories and farms! They want us to pull out of Tajikistan because it is ruining their profits!\u201d\nThis sounded like a good idea to Jieling, but she had to admit, she hated the news so she wasn\u2019t sure why they were fighting in Tajikistan anyway. Something about Muslim terrorists. All she knew about Muslims was that they made great street food.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be patriots?\u201d Mr. Wei said.\n\u201cYou broke into my room and tried to steal my\u2014you know that\u2019s not a computer, don\u2019t you?\u201d Jieling said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bio battery. They\u2019re selling them to the Americans. Wal-Mart.\u201d\nMr. Wei groaned.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t work in special projects,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cYou said you did,\u201d he protested.\n\u201cWe did not,\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou just thought that. How did you know this was my room?\u201d\n\u201cThe company lists all its workers in a directory,\u201d he said wearily. \u201cAnd it\u2019s movie night, everyone is either out or goes to the movies. I\u2019ve had the building under surveillance for weeks. I followed you to the market today. Last week it was a girl named Pingli, who blabbed about everything, but she wasn\u2019t in special projects.\n\u201cI put you on the bus, I\u2019ve timed the route three times. I should have had an hour and fifteen minutes to drive over here and get the box and get out.\u201d\n\u201cWe made all our connections,\u201d Baiyue explained.\nMr. Wei was so dispirited he didn\u2019t even respond.\nJieling said. \u201cI thought the government was supposed to help workers. If we get caught, we\u2019ll be fined and we\u2019ll be deeper in debt.\u201d She was just talking. Talking, talking, talking too much. This was too strange. Like when someone was dying. Something extraordinary was happening, like your father dying in the next room, and yet the ordinary things went on, too. You made tea, your mother opened the shop the next day, and sewed clothes while she cried. People came in and pretended not to notice. This was like that. Mr. Wei had a gun and they were explaining about New Life. \u201cDebt?\u201d Mr. Wei said.\n\u201cTo the company,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all in debt. The company hires us and says they are going to pay us, but then they charge us for our food and our clothes and our dorm and it always costs more than we earn. That\u2019s why we were doing rap today. To make money to be able to quit.\u201d Mr. Wei\u2019s glasses had tape holding the arm on. Why hadn\u2019t she noticed that in the restaurant? Maybe because when you are afraid you notice things. When your father is dying of the plague, you notice the way the covers on your mother\u2019s chairs need to be washed. You wonder if you will have to do it or if you will die before you have to do chores.\n\u201cThe Pingli girl,\u201d he said, \u201cshe said the same thing. That\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cLike anybody cares.\u201d\n\u201cCould you expose corruption?\u201d Jieling asked.\nMr. Wei shrugged, at least as much as he could in the pillowcase. \u201cMaybe. But they would just pay bribes to locals and it would all go away.\u201d\nAll three of them sighed.\n\u201cExcept,\u201d Mr. Wei said, sitting up a little straighter. \u201cThe Americans. They are always getting upset about that sort of thing. Last year there was a corporation, the Shanghai Six. The Americans did a documentary on them and then Western companies would not do business. If they got information from us about what New Life is doing . . . \u201d\n\u201cWho else is going to buy bio batteries?\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cThe company would be in big trouble!\u201d\n\u201cBeijing can threaten a big expose, tell The New York Times newspaper!\u201d Mr. Wei said, getting excited. \u201cMy Beijing supervisor will love that! He loves media!\u201d\n\u201cThen you can have a big show trial,\u201d Jieling said.\nMr. Wei was nodding.\n\u201cBut what is in it for us?\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s a trial, they\u2019ll have to cancel your debt!\u201d Mr. Wei said. \u201cEven pay you a big fine!\u201d\n\u201cIf I call the floor auntie and say I caught a corporate spy, they\u2019ll give me a big bonus,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you care about the other workers?\u201d Mr. Wei asked.\nJieling and Baiyue looked at each other and shrugged. Did they? \u201cWhat are they going to do to you anyway?\u201d Jieling said. \u201cYou can still do big expose. But that way we don\u2019t have to wait.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201cyou let me go, and I\u2019ll let you keep my money.\u201d\nSomeone rattled the door handle.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Mr. Wei whispered. \u201cYou can be heroes for your fellow workers, even though they\u2019ll never know it.\u201d\nJieling stuck the money in her pocket. Then she took the papers, too.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take those,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d she said. \u201cIf after six months, there is no big corruption scandal? We can let everyone know how a government secret agent was outsmarted by two factory girls.\u201d\n\u201cSix months!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not long enough!\u201d\n\u201cIt better be,\u201d Jieling said.\nOutside the door, Taohua called, \u201cJieling? Are you in there? Something is wrong with the door!\u201d\n\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Jieling called. \u201cI had trouble with it when I came home.\u201d To Mr. Wei she whispered sternly, \u201cDon\u2019t you try anything. If you do, we\u2019ll scream our heads off and everybody will come running.\u201d She and Baiyue shimmied the pillowcase off of Mr. Wei\u2019s head. He started to stand up and jerked the boombox which clattered across the floor. \u201cWait!\u201d she hissed and untied him.\nTaohua called through the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cHold on!\u201d Jieling called.\nBaiyue helped Mr. Wei stand up. Mr. Wei climbed onto the desk and then grabbed a line hanging outside. He stopped a moment as if trying to think of something to say.\n\u201c \u2018A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery\u2019,\u201d Jieling said. It had been her father\u2019s favorite quote from Chairman Mao. \u201c \u2018 . . . it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of by which one class overthrows another\u2019.\u201d\nMr. Wei looked as if he might cry and not because he was moved by patriotism. He stepped back and disappeared. Jieling and Baiyue looked out the window. He did go down the wall just like a secret agent from a movie, but it was only two stories. There was still the big footprint in the middle of Taohua\u2019s magazine and the room looked as if it had been hit by a storm.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to think you had a boyfriend,\u201d Baiyue whispered to Jieling.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jieling said, pulling the chair out from under the door handle. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to think he\u2019s rich.\u201d\nIt was Sunday, and Jieling and Baiyue were sitting on the beach. Jieling\u2019s cellphone rang, a little chime of M.I.A. hip-hop. Even though it was Sunday, it was one of the girls from New Life. Sunday should be a day off, but she took the call anyway.\n\u201cJieling? This is Xia Meili? From packaging. Taohua told me about your business? Maybe you could help me?\u201d\nJieling said, \u201cSure. What is your debt, Meili?\u201d\n\u201c3,800 R.M.B.,\u201d Meili said. \u201cI know it\u2019s a lot.\u201d\nJieling said, \u201cNot so bad. We have a lot of people who already have loans, though, and it will probably be a few weeks before I can make you a loan.\u201d\nWith Mr. Wei\u2019s capital, Jieling and Baiyue had opened a bank account. They had bought themselves out, and then started a little loan business where they bought people out of New Life. Then people had to pay them back with a little extra. They had each had jobs\u2014Jieling worked for a company that made toys. She sat each day at a table where she put a piece of specially shaped plastic over the body of a little doll, an action figure. The plastic fit right over the figure and had cut-outs. Jieling sprayed the whole thing with red paint and when the piece of plastic was lifted, the action figure had a red shirt. It was boring, but at the end of the week, she got paid instead of owing the company money.\nShe and Baiyue used all their extra money on loans to get girls out of New Life. More and more loans, and more and more payments. Now New Life had sent them a threatening letter saying that what they were doing was illegal. But Mr. Wei said not to worry. Two officials had come and talked to them and had showed them legal documents and had them explain everything about what had happened. Soon, the officials promised, they would take New Life to court.\nJieling wasn\u2019t so sure about the officials. After all, Mr. Wei was an official. But a foreign newspaperman had called them. He was from a newspaper called The Wall Street Journal and he said that he was writing a story about labor shortages in China after the bird flu. He said that in some places in the west there were reports of slavery. His Chinese was very good. His story was going to come out in the United States tomorrow. Then she figured officials would have to do something or lose face.\nJieling told Meili to call her back in two weeks\u2014although hopefully in two weeks no one would need help to get away from New Life\u2014and wrote a note to herself in her little notebook.\nBaiyue was sitting looking at the water. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve been to the beach,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe ocean is so big, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nBaiyue nodded, scuffing at the white sand. \u201cPeople always say that, but you don\u2019t know until you see it.\u201d\nJieling said, \u201cYeah.\u201d Funny, she had lived here for months. Baiyue had lived here more than a year. And they had never come to the beach. The beach was beautiful.\n\u201cI feel sorry for Mr. Wei,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Jieling said. \u201cDo you think he really had a daughter who died?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cA lot of people died.\u201d\n\u201cMy father died,\u201d Jieling said.\nBaiyue looked at her, a quick little sideways look, then back out at the ocean. \u201cMy mother died,\u201d she said.\nJieling was surprised. She had never known that Baiyue\u2019s mother was dead. They had talked about so much but never about that. She put her arm around Baiyue\u2019s waist and they sat for a while.\n\u201cI feel bad in a way,\u201d Baiyue said.\n\u201cHow come?\u201d Jieling said.\n\u201cBecause we had to steal capital to fight New Life. That makes us capitalists.\u201d\nJieling shrugged.\n\u201cI wish it was like when they fought the revolution,\u201d Baiyue said. \u201cThings were a lot more simple.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jieling said, \u201cand they were poor and a lot of them died.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Baiyue sighed.\nJieling knew what she meant. It would be nice to . . . to be sure what was right and what was wrong. Although not if it made you like Mr. Wei.\nPoor Mr. Wei. Had his daughter really died?\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jieling said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to make a call. Wait right here.\u201d She walked a little down the beach. It was windy and she turned her back to protect the cellphone, like someone lighting a match. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, \u201chello, mama, it\u2019s me. Jieling.\u201d\nOriginally published in The Del Rey Book of Science Fiction and Fantasy, edited by Ellen Datlow (2008).\nMaureen F.

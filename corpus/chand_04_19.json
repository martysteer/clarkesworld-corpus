The john\u2019s got a kink so I kink up: pop two neon pills, fresh off my printer. Class-D molecules, his schematics. They don\u2019t sell this in stores.\nThe capsule dissolves, its virus reprograms the synthcode padding my DNA. I try not to squirm as my hair turns into tentacles.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the john says. He draws it out like he\u2019s in pain, and, wait for it, starts panting a second later. \u201cYou\u2019re so filthy, invade my planet\u201d . . . all we\u2019ve got is amino acids on Enceladus. I wonder what movies he\u2019s been watching.\nThe pill is giving me a stomachache, so I roll my eyes and wink at my reflection. 256 base pairs on chromosome 10 that are incompatible with the designer genes my mother hacked into me, and I have the metabolic control of someone in one of those barbaric breed-only countries.\nI flutter my eyelashes, make my best moue\u2014don\u2019t feel the slime on my skin\u2014and let out a long, fake sigh. I heave my breasts to make the sound more real, yes, yes, he\u2019s listening. Oh god. I want a virus to make this stop. I want more. I want him to never stop listening to me.\nMy code reasserts itself and the tentacles wither away, as promised. Cash in my account, the usual. But it\u2019s the ad time I care about, ten extra seconds. For that much, we could\u2019ve gone longer. Oh well. He loves those tentacles.\n43.396 seconds, mine to spend. There are two main streams on the Net\u2019. The pornliners watching my every move, contact information laid over my breasts. A hint of blurred vagina, just enough to let them know how flexible my code is.\nOr I could go the other way. A friendly face from any memory you like, a quiet listener or the girl in class you always wanted to talk to, Rinny Albatross from Zenith 4, a whole range of gamegirls. My face, the gentle smile I associate with playing outside, the Bubble reflecting soft yellow rays on my mother\u2019s face. It\u2019s been so long, I\u2019ve forgotten to hate her, and all that\u2019s left is the nostalgia my clients love. They love watching beautiful people remember.\nMy skin is creamy, rose highlights showcasing the perfect texture. So malleable, I\u2019ve been green and black and rainbow-striped, insectile eyes\u2014not much use for seeing, but that john gave me a whole minute\u2014antennae out of my head. A grandmother with wrinkles so deep I was rubbing my face for days, amazed at how we decayed before synthcode.\nAnything you want. I\u2019ll show you anything.\nThey\u2019ll see my ads here and there between football and clonewars. I shiver, I tingle. Those eyes on my body. My face. Thinking about it gets me hot, hotter than I\u2019ve ever made a john. If I wait too long it\u2019ll hurt.\nI clear my head in the shower. My body presses against the wall, desperate, then not. Steam sinks into my skin, the pores widen. Instant moisturizer.\nOnce my breathing is back to normal, I decide to split my time 10/30. Ten for the pornliners since word-of-mouth helps more anyway. Thirty for the families, parents, and offspring. I can make myself look very young, although it doesn\u2019t work in person. The proportions are wrong.\n3.396 seconds left behind like angry words. I dare myself to look at the numbers without cringing, and then my phone rings.\nMy skin burns\u2014unexpected calls always set my body off. The synthcode can\u2019t touch this. I try to think of unpleasant things. Tentacles on my flesh. Crawling. Bugs, those six-legged things at the terrarium. Sick. I stare through my mirror and hope the smear of red is a smile.\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u201cIshtar? Ishtar Kim?\u201d Oh god oh god oh god my name. I almost beg her\u2014the voice is female, anyway\u2014to say it again.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say when I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t sound like I\u2019ve just had sex.\n\u201cWould you like an hour?\u201d\nA whole hour. An entire hour of Net\u2019 ads. Full body shots, censored nudes or fully clothed, one full transformation of my synthcode better than all the other synthcodes out there, trying to swing an incomplete set of gills or neon hair that\u2019s still black at the tips\u2014fuck them all. Just me, it\u2019ll be me for a whole hour. With that kind of time, they can\u2019t ignore me.\nI have to excuse myself.\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say once I\u2019m dry. \u201cI\u2019m calling back about the\u201d\u2014lick my lips\u2014\u201chour.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to meet us in person. A public location. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll need a reference.\u201d Sanjay got scammed, they ripped his DNA for the organ farms and who knows how many people have access to his genome now. It\u2019s one thing to share yourself. It\u2019s another thing to know your body is out there, pieces of it available to anyone with the right molecules and a good printer.\nBut this woman with the magical hour references Cody. I like him, he knows exactly what he is. What we are.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you message me the location, too, I can check all that out.\u201d\n\u201cSure thing. We\u2019ve also advanced you ten minutes. I know it\u2019s hard to believe we have a full hour, so this is on us.\u201d I bite my lip so hard the taste of copper floods my mouth, but a whimper still escapes.\nOnce I get over the ten fresh minutes in my account, I call Cody. \u201cThey\u2019re safe,\u201d he tells me, the words scrolling across my view. He must be with a client, he isn\u2019t sharing a visual. Part of me wants to cry, remembering my mother\u2019s back to me because I wouldn\u2019t tell her I loved her. I imagine kicking the biohacks out of my body. It\u2019s made me feel better since I was old enough for the real biology classes.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he says. He knows how it feels, to not get a visual.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. So?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re kinda weird, but, you know.\u201d That\u2019s the job.\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\nI hang up and check out the location from @KAMINI, whose profile picture matches her voice. She\u2019s staring straight ahead, the tip of her ponytail a knife when I edge my head around the back of the holo. She\u2019s got a suit on, and it hugs her curves, emphasizing the tilt of the breasts and the lift of the buttocks. Kamini doesn\u2019t look more than thirty, but if she can afford a real linen suit, she could be fifty. We\u2019ve had synthcode for two generations now.\nShe wants to meet at Rose\u2019s Diner, tomorrow at noon. I\u2019ve been there before, I wonder if that\u2019s why she picked it. Did she . . . research me?\nAt the last minute I decide au naturel isn\u2019t good enough and turn my hair searing pink, watching closely in the mirror. The change propagates from the roots, protein refolding and refolding in response to the algorithms inserted between my genes. Dilated blood vessels add blush to my cheeks, and double-thick lashes frame my eyes.\nI head out in a semitransparent latex wrap, bright green to offset the hair, layered strategically so I\u2019m not violating decency laws. I hop on the train, and it\u2019s nothing like the Network. Maybe five, ten people glance at me, never when their friends or lovers will see them. Clients don\u2019t see \u2019hacks like me in public.\nKamini is waiting at a table when I get there. Her hair is as coiffed as the hologram\u2014no Photoshop. We trade access keys and I learn she\u2019s 60% synthcode, no biohacks. 20% closer to perfection than me, and infinitely more in control of her body.\nI slide in opposite her, my rear reshaping against the contours of the chair.\n\u201cI\u2019m Kamini,\u201d she says, \u201cbut call me Kams.\u201d She is completely focused on me. I try to focus back, but awe creeps through my skin. If she doesn\u2019t want to feel something, she doesn\u2019t. Every moment of her life is better than the previous one, if she wants it to be.\nSo what does she want with me?\n\u201cWhat were you hoping for?\u201d I ask her. My gut twists. I need to stay in control.\nShe sips her coffee, lips caressing the ceramic. Her eyes never leave me. Every bit of my visible skin, the twitching in my neck and the tiny wrinkle in my forehead. The need smolders\u2014look at me forever, her eyes are slightly tilted and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like if she smiled at me. The synthcode doesn\u2019t care, but my DNA wants to worship her.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you order something first. I\u2019m paying.\u201d The menu hovers in front of me. I select chamomile tea, lab-grown. She orders chamomile tea, field-grown.\n\u201cNow that you know I\u2019m a real person,\u201d she says, \u201cwhat my group wants is to observe you. We\u2019ll ask a series of questions and record your verbal and physiological responses. There\u2019s five of us and it\u2019ll take place in a warehouse we\u2019ve rented. The phone\u2019s unblocked so if you feel unsafe you can page out any time.\u201d\nShe is more than perfect\u2014she\u2019s omniscient. No, that\u2019s too far, I could kick myself in the genome. Cody said it, she\u2019s worked with us before. She knows how we operate. That part of us, along with a detailed explanation of why it\u2019s illegal now, is online. I can\u2019t imagine what she wants with the rest.\n\u201cSure,\u201d I say.\nI am on a chair under a strong mercury light\u2014I dilate my blood vessels to counter the bluish tint\u2014and five of them are facing me. They measure my pulse, breathing, brainwaves. A routine hovers in front of me, jacked in where my synthcode accesses my brainstem.\nI\u2019ve fantasized about giving this much of myself away, on display, every piece of me laid out on an altar. Please, half of me wants to tell them, butcher me. Send me up in smoke like a burned offering.\nThe other half of me runs away screaming.\n\u201cIshtar Kim\u201d\u2014I chose it when I was sixteen, I\u2019m glad that\u2019s the name they know\u2014\u201cJu-Hee Kim designed you with the need-attention mod, seen in single mothers who have been abandoned by their spouses during or shortly after the pregnancy.\u201d I\u2019m tempted to point out that need-attention engineering is more common in younger women who used a sperm donor, but that wasn\u2019t my story.\nThe biohacks want me to rise as these people dig through my history. For now, I win\u2014I remember how to be disgusted.\n\u201cAnything else you need to know?\u201d I say.\nOne of them raises a hand. \u201cHow does this make you feel?\u201d\nI can\u2019t tell which \u201cyou\u201d he\u2019s asking about. The me my mother made, the one melting at the thought that these people want to listen to my voice? Or the one I engineered with my own money?\nNo matter what Cody says, I don\u2019t yet believe they won\u2019t cut me up. I embrace that fear. Adrenaline dampens the constant stream of yes-yes-yes, and I direct my synthcode towards seducing them. A whole hour, shit. I want that hour. Their weights shift forward simultaneously. No one else would notice, but the DNA in me tingles. If they have a whole hour of airtime to spare, they must have more.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d I say. \u201cA whole hour is a lot of time.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you like more?\u201d\nIt takes every last bit of my will to hold back the raging storm so I can say, face moving the merest fraction of an inch, \u201cI\u2019m interested.\u201d\n\u201cGood. If you have any questions, you can try Cody. He\u2019s told us you know each other.\u201d Not much more than that, I\u2019m sure. Cody is discreet. He\u2019s as good as I am\u2014almost, anyway, it\u2019s harder on the males. I\u2019ll ping him when I get home.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Cody says. \u201cThey want to know more about you, it feels nice.\u201d\nI have three hours in my account, three hours I\u2019m too nervous to use\u2014although I spent the time from my other clients right away. I can\u2019t leave the johns completely. Even if they don\u2019t want to know what foods I loved when I was a kid, whether or not those and my other interests changed once the synthcode implants went through. If I\u2019m ever thrown back to the Network, I need to make sure they haven\u2019t forgotten all the shit I can make my body do.\nKams\u2019 friends ask me every personal question I can imagine. Personal, in the sense you can\u2019t find them written in my DNA or my public file, but worthless on the dark Net\u2019. And Kams herself\u2014her mouth forms the most benevolent of smiles, and no more. I assume she\u2019s recording, her eyes always follow the speaker. She\u2019s watching the one furthest to my left.\n\u201cWhat was going to school like?\u201d\nThey have special classrooms, ones where they don\u2019t look at you when it\u2019s your turn to speak.\nAfter we were emancipated, they put surveillance on the buses to our dorms. We\u2019d sneak into the depot and watch ourselves on the security feeds. Pregnancies dropped by 30% after they threw out the cameras.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worst when you\u2019re a teen,\u201d I say, but this isn\u2019t true. We didn\u2019t think about it when we were teenagers. Fucking without consequences\u2014conceiving fatally biohacked babies. Cody\u2019s girlfriend, Gloria, had two bloody miscarriages before it came back to haunt us, worming through the DNA. Gloria lost her mind. Cody has nightmares. I have no uterus.\nHow can I explain that to these people, most of all Kams? Do her parents really think she\u2019s their daughter? She\u2019s closer to the Network, a whole other class of being. Her offspring will be written on chips pressed into the neural tubing of embryos drawn from frozen eggs.\nI used to think my mother was perfect, too.\nThey ask me about her. Did she try to compensate, once she realized what she\u2019d done? Did she take advantage?\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d Now that they aren\u2019t asking about me, the death grip on my desire has relaxed. I don\u2019t want to think about her. I don\u2019t see why my mother\u2019s bad decisions matter. The original version, my design, is banned. The Council has spoken: fertility cannot be lost. To preserve my species, I\u2019ll have to live forever. With someone watching me.\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cMy memories are fuzzy,\u201d I say truthfully.\nThey look at each other. Their eyes flicker as they transmit signals. A private conference. I can feel my body tense. Don\u2019t let them go don\u2019t let them go\u2014\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I have to say, hating how easily the apology rolls off my tongue. \u201cBut those times, there was a lot wrong with the situation. We have counseling. I used mine to forget. I\u2019ll tell you more about me, if you want.\u201d Eager to please. Please them with my pheromones, a subtle steady stream. No one likes discussing benefits to the need-attention mod, but we are the best at making people look at us.\nAnd I have found the gap in Kams\u2019 perfect fa\u00e7ade.\nI drop my arms down, uncross my ankles. Spread a little. I\u2019ve worn a body stocking today and I hint at the bunching where my legs run into my ass. Some of them know what I\u2019m doing, but the pheromones make it harder to care. They aren\u2019t as aware of their physiology as people should be, Kams least of all.\nI know I\u2019ve won when Kams gives me that look my body craves. \u201cWe want you to help us launch a campaign to completely ban organic mods,\u201d she says with stars in her eyes, fire on her breath.\nThere would never be someone like me again.\nThe first day of school, before I learned that kids aren\u2019t supposed to cry with happiness when their mothers scream at them. The colonies for emancipated minors, knowing that no matter what we did we\u2019d do it better, faster, harder\u2014for attention.\n\u201cWhat about the other mods?\u201d I say. \u201cParents dump all kinds of shit on their kids.\u201d\n\u201cCode is fine\u2014prenatal code can stay. But we want all other mods banned.\u201d I hear it in her voice: no more you. But she\u2019ll be allowed. Hex code instead of base pairs.\nFor once, my biohacked and real halves are in sync. This feels wrong.\n\u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be public. Interviews, talk shows, you know?\u201d She flashes her beautiful, symmetrical smile. I can almost hear her wonder, do I stop touching myself long enough to learn what these things are? I project eagerness. \u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again.\u201d\nThat night, I tell Cody to come over. Once we\u2019re done, pressed under the sheets, our bodies cool and sweatless, he has a confession. \u201cI slept with them.\u201d\nOnly one of \u201cthem\u201d matters. \u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nA flash of guilt corrodes my satisfaction at exposing his shame. No classroom taught us how to control ourselves, and I never heard the boys talk about it as much as the girls did. Male or female, the fastest way around our biohacks is explosive surrender.\nAnd why not? We know Kams won\u2019t get pregnant with some biohacked mutant.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d I murmur, but he is already asleep. I wonder if he knows I\u2019ve smelled her plastic on his skin for weeks.\nWhen they ask, I lie about the sex. \u201cEvery night I\u2019ve met you,\u201d I say. \u201cOrgies, one on ones, men and women. I don\u2019t ask their names.\u201d\nMaybe I overplayed it. They look at each other, eyes flashing private messages, and then one of them says, \u201cWill you be . . . okay . . . for the interview?\u201d\nThe distaste in his voice is nothing new. I toss the long blond filaments of today\u2019s hair back, so the tiny pasties on my breasts are visible, bouncing as I take a loud, deep breath. \u201cI can take care of myself,\u201d I say, shifting in my chiffon cocoon. \u201cWhen is this happening?\u201d\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve got your answers,\u201d Kams says. No mention of Cody, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be there. The two of us make a matched pair, if we tweak our synthcode enough.\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\nShe waves her hand, file transfer to my brain. I accept and unfold it gently, skimming the bullet points, vague but all pointing to the same conclusion. Kams can\u2019t access the interview questions in advance, but she knows what to expect just as she always has. Her file tells me when to say my progenitor and when my mother, so there\u2019s never a tasteless display of feeling.\nI\u2019m not surprised at the tragedy she\u2019s made my life into. I flutter my eyelashes, peek at her. She\u2019s watching me. My limbic system reacts, of course, trying to turn my body to jelly, but her gaze slashes the sensation in half.\nHer head must be like this warehouse. Vast, neat, the tiniest space preserved in unhappy recognition of its organic aberrations. Does she go to bed hating the slime inside herself, knowing that unmodified DNA is a silent bomb waiting to break something the synthcode can\u2019t fix? She would be truly perfect without the genes\u2014I would be human without the genes.\nEyes drilling into my skull, Kams doesn\u2019t blink once. Hair cascades down her shoulders in coiffed waves, the stiffness complementing her stare. \u201cThis is all good,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\nWhen I return home, I have a message waiting from Cody.\nI\u2019m out.\nI ping him right away. The nanoseconds, milliseconds tick by and at last the connection joins. Video on. He\u2019s daubing paint on his body. His signature look. The people who want to see Cody in a facsimile of a suit, every inch of his torso outlined in gray, aren\u2019t the same people who want to see me decked out in colors and barely-legal layers. It\u2019s why we managed to stay friends after we left the colony: no competition.\nHe won\u2019t make eye contact with me.\n\u201cCody,\u201d I say, \u201clook at me.\u201d Not just because I need the eyes . . . His face is covered in gray paint, but I see a faint red line on his cheek. Even the scratch is perfectly straight. I can\u2019t believe it hasn\u2019t healed yet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThey wanted to bring Gloria in.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d I\u2019ve only ever discussed my mother with them, which doesn\u2019t scare me. But my mother didn\u2019t scream uncontrollably the last time I looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s been ten years,\u201d I almost say, but I am stopped by the thought of her nails, slicing his flesh with mathematical precision.\n\u201cI just wanted to let you know I won\u2019t be at the interview.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a question, not a statement. I can walk out, too. I can never know what it\u2019s like to have all those Net\u2019 streams on me\u2014and only me. We\u2019ll still be friends, unlike most of the other need-attention kids out there, hiding in their caves and under their bridges.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.\nCody shrugs. His voice is muffled, chin tucked into his chest as he rubs paint on the small of his back. \u201cDo what you have to.\u201d\nThe feed cuts off, the afterimage of his cheek glowing red in my mind.\nThe room is round and small, thick walls to prevent signal interference. The presenter is a bubble that flits from here to there: camera, lighting, and interviewer all in one. There are two people already seated.\nKams, and my mother.\nA number flashes against the wall. 3,009 networks logged onto our show. I tug on my dress, slipping it lower. 4,210. Pure instinct, but the guilt in my mother\u2019s eyes is impossible to miss. She caught me wandering nude often enough, didn\u2019t she?\nI tug my dress even lower, and that\u2019s when I realize I am free of her, if not her long-ago decisions. She could be one of those people on the train. When you\u2019ve had millions lusting after you, networks upon networks of lonely horny people, what does one more face matter? I don\u2019t even look like her, and I never did. If I have to be this chimera of designer and human genes and synthcode, I will be the best.\nKams delivers two minutes of why we\u2019re here\u2014organic mods are so cheap, everyone has access to them, that\u2019s great\u2014and then shifts into anecdote. \u201cI had my own horse,\u201d she says. A real horse. Wires running through pneumatic joints, large enough to ride on. A feat of engineering, with a touch of DNA for the silky mane. People can tell when something is synthetic. I remember when I first saw her, thinking that slight distance from humanity made her something better.\n\u201cBut not everyone grows up with these advantages,\u201d Kams finishes. Her eyes float towards us.\nMy mother shoots me the tiniest glance before she starts talking. As she describes her impoverished adolescence, the early marriage to get away from home, I rub the silk on my thighs. If it weren\u2019t taut on my skin, it would crease horribly. How much did Kams offer her to humiliate herself on camera?\n\u201cWe had so little. When he started seeing other people, I had even less.\u201d\n\u201cAnd is that why you thought your daughter should have the need-attention mod?\u201d The interviewers send the question through the presenter\u2019s pleasantly modulated, gender-neutral voice.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d my mother says. \u201cNo one knew about the consequences.\u201d\nKams reaches across to tap her arm. I eventually realize this is meant to be a comforting gesture. My mother is a mess, running mascara and wisps of hair drifting across a lined forehead. But viewers love this rare glimpse of unadulterated humanity. We pass 10,000 networks and the pressure builds inside my skull. So many people, and I\u2019m not the center of attention.\nMy mother wipes her left eye. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen my daughter in ten years.\u201d Twelve, but I don\u2019t know why I counted.\nThe interviewer gasps dramatically, bouncing several feet to compensate for its lack of expression. Kams lures her legs out from underneath the chair and stands up. This is her moment. I have to admire her posture, it\u2019s perfect for a business presentation.\n\u201cYes. It\u2019s tragic. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing our best to prevent anyone else from going through what these brave people have survived.\u201d From her mouth, \u201cpeople\u201d doesn\u2019t sound matter-of-fact. It sounds like a virus. Do us a favor and wipe us off the Earth.\nMy turn. I recall the script she has given me, tiny words scrolling against my eyeball. But my attention is on the numbers\u2014so many streams. 14,000, 15,000, 16,000. I have to divert my synthcode so I don\u2019t drop on the ground right there and rub myself to oblivion. As my pores return to default, the silk clings more than I\u2019d thought possible. At least there isn\u2019t much of it.\nThe interviewers want to know\u2014Kams wants everyone to know\u2014how many classes I flunked, how often I wished I didn\u2019t need attention, how often I skipped activities because I knew I\u2019d just end up fucking someone or touching myself later. None, constantly, twice. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say each time.\nI want them to ask me if the synthcode has fixed all my problems, if I didn\u2019t try to tear out as much DNA as I could manage only because my mother designed it. Or\u2014if they dare\u2014what the difference is between someone who is biohacked to need attention, and the people who simply crave it. What it\u2019s like to think you\u2019re a monster because, in you, a human trait is exaggerated\u2014and sit opposite a being who is hardly human at all.\nThe silk chafes my distended nipples. The streams taper off near 17,000, even though there\u2019s more and more out there. I need to earn their love. But changing topics without approval could get me banned for days. No Network. No ads. Nothing.\n\u201cHow many of your friends miscarried?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My pelvis tenses.\nWe lose 300 networks and Kams moves in like a predator, pressing my mother towards me. Carefully modulated for appeal based on past data, I don\u2019t doubt it.\nWe end up in a tight circle. Kams and my mother are glaring at me. As I meet Kams\u2019 eyes, she flashes me a message. Back to the script, now. She must have sent something to the interviewers, too, because the presenter chirps at me.\n\u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to say to parents who are thinking about biohacking their offspring?\u201d\nI should probably look at my mother and tell her she\u2019s a horrible bitch. But I don\u2019t care anymore. My shoulders sway into a shrug. The numbers matter more. I need the wall to tell me I am important.\nMore networks drop offline. My guts squeeze, tears threaten my eyes. Quickly, a desperate twist in my synthcode, I can\u2019t cry. Not that I\u2019d lose potential clients\u2014half of them think crying is hot\u2014crying would further Kams\u2019 cause. Hex code instead of base pairs, stupid decisions eliminated with algorithmic precision.\nI want to smash the perfection from her face. See if she even bleeds.\nAnd then it occurs to me: why not?\nSex sells, but so does violence. Part of me never stopped thinking of her as better, but that isn\u2019t right. She\u2019s other.\nKams looks brittle and my mother has her fists clenched tight. I mimic my mother\u2019s\u2014progenitor\u2019s\u2014gesture, drawing my elbow back slowly. The tiniest bit of sweat trickling down my breasts brings back 42 streams. I send synthcode to reinforce my arm, thicken the skin on my knuckles.\nBefore anyone can watch my composure shatter\u2014the waves of dropping numbers, look at me me me me me oh god it hurts, no, yes\u2014I hit Kams in her shining mouth.\nAs blood drips from my knuckles, the wall explodes with numbers. Ecstasy ripples my body. Everyone is watching me, and Goddess is dead.\nPriya Chand is a California transplant living in the Midwest.

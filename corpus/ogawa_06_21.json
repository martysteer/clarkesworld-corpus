He had a long history of suffering from allergic reactions, ever since he was a child. When he\u2019d reached this pattern atelier for the first time as a social insurance consultant, he\u2019d long given up on his perpetually teary eyes. That day, he was looking for something to hang over the wall of his new office, but before he could start talking about his interior decorations, the founder of this atelier, Kiriko\u2019s mentor, pointed at the client\u2019s eyes and said, \u201cLet me fix that first.\u201d\n\u201cAnd who would have thought you\u2019d walk out of a pattern atelier with medication?\u201d Mr. Hama had laughed, when Kiriko had just joined the place.\nNow Kiriko looked back into his ear, just to be sure. \u201cThis is weird,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we discussed many times, most of your symptoms are caused by when your native pattern is distorted on your soft, flexible skin, like near your eardrums. But this distorted allergy pattern is always your native pattern gone wrong\u2014the basic structures are the same, but they expand in different manners into different directions. This new thing here now, however, doesn\u2019t seem to have any relevance to the pattern on your other parts. Even the color is completely different.\u201d\n\u201cHm. Can I have a look, too?\u201d\n\u201cSorry, you won\u2019t be able to see it. Only a pattern craftsperson can.\u201d\nMr. Hama smiled weakly, mocking disappointment. \u201cOf course. Can you make a pattern which \u2018offsets\u2019 this allergy pattern? Like always?\u201d\nKiriko was still frowning, her hand at her chin. As he suggested, that would be something she\u2019d normally do: make a pattern whose lines could adjust the way the blood flow and water/air currents ran around the distorted pattern, to eventually smooth the ragged edges of the distortion. But . . .\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cThe remedy patterns for you, they need to be something that have enough affinity with your native pattern. Otherwise the remedy pattern itself can cause a different type of malfunction in some other part of your body. But to offset this new thing, which is completely out of place itself, we would need to construct a pattern that would be too . . . foreign. You may as well go see a doctor, at the clinic.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but the clinic could do nothing for my situation!\u201d\nThe door of the atelier\u2019s lab opened, and Kiriko\u2019s mentor walked in. \u201cHama, she\u2019s saying this might not be an allergy.\u201d\nThe client turned in his chair. \u201cHuh.\u201d He looked at the two craftspersons of the atelier in turn. \u201cI\u2014I never thought I would ever have to visit them again.\u201d\n\u201cYou are old enough to, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nKiriko sighed. \u201cHama-san, take him with you and leave him there.\u201d\nMr. Hama laughed and then shook his head. \u201cYou two are my primary doctors, if you say I should, I will do it.\u201d\nAnd three days later, Mr. Hama\u2019s two primary doctors found themselves in the office of a clinic doctor.\n\u201cWhy do you look so ill at ease?\u201d asked the clinic doctor, Sakata, whose eyes were the color of blurry iolite. When he moved his head the tips of his hair shone in the same color.\n\u201cWe always thought the clinic didn\u2019t like us,\u201d the owner of the atelier said. \u201cWe still do.\u201d\nThe doctor waved his hand in a negating gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s just the city, they don\u2019t like the way you seem to utilize patterns to get what you want. But as far as we doctors and nurses can see, no one\u2019s feeling worse under your care.\u201d\n\u201cToday you have something to say to us though?\u201d\n\u201cI just have a question.\u201d Sakata smiled. \u201cYou sent Hama-san our way. He said you saw something unusual. We discovered a polyp down his throat, nothing too bad, as diagnoses go. But . . . there\u2019s something . . . weird about this.\u201d\n\u201cDo doctors say \u2018weird\u2019?\u201d Kiriko whispered.\nTo her surprise Sakata laughed heartily. \u201cI do, obviously. Some figures of the test results aren\u2019t matching what we see. You felt something odd about him before our diagnosis, yes? The thing is, we are having a few more patients with the same kind of polyp. Even a foreigner. Can you tell us what this thing is that you found?\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s mentor leaned forward. \u201cIt was a silent pattern\u2014we call it that to distinguish it from ordinary patterns that can be found on the human body, because it\u2019s the way currents of light, air, sound, and other things happening there summed up as a pattern, so the ordinary eye cannot see it. The silent pattern on Hama we found was too out of place. Kiriko here sketched it, but to compare it to other patients\u2019 cases we ourselves need to have a look.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d The doctor sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some of our android nurses talk about how strange the way you two see the world is.\u201d\nKiriko raised her brows. \u201cYou have ando-san as nurses here?\u201d\n\u201cYes, a lot more than you can imagine, I guess. Many patients don\u2019t like being treated by them, so we never disclose which ones. Only a few doctors here know. I\u2019m counting on your discretion with this information, by the way.\u201d\nMany civil servants in this city were androids, as everybody knew. But the city itself never talked about them, as it didn\u2019t want to admit that there were entities with \u201cartificial\u201d colors and patterns on their skin, while valuing islanders with native colors and patterns in its society. And so the people of the city didn\u2019t discuss them either\u2014nobody was quite sure how the androids should be treated. Whereas colorless and patternless laborers like the two craftspersons were easy prey in this society.\nKiriko and her mentor could usually tell an android when they saw one\u2014they were too perfectly moderate. The androids\u2019 colors and patterns were always just a little bit less flashy, probably to not stand out more than the humans. But those working at the clinic seemed indistinguishable at this point. Some rich locals didn\u2019t even like being in the care of colorless locals, so they were unlikely to tolerate being treated by andos. The city must have been very thorough about them here.\n\u201cDo you think those patients you\u2019re talking about will gladly let us peek into their ears and nostrils? You said there\u2019s a foreigner, too, right?\u201d Kiriko said.\n\u201cYou will be here as nurses in disguise. We\u2019ll lend you masks, caps, and gowns, so that the patients won\u2019t have to see much of your skin.\u201d\nKiriko and her mentor looked at each other and then both turned back to the doctor. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d the owner of the atelier said, \u201cwe\u2019re on.\u201d\nAnd yes, they found one out-of-place silent pattern in each patient, and after having a very, very close look (one patient needed sedation for this), there seemed to be an invisible yet distinct line between the polyp and this strange pattern. And the pattern around the affected spot altered by the second, and this must have been why the test results didn\u2019t quite match the diagnoses. But this unstable pattern was only making the patients uncomfortable, with mild coughs or stomachaches and such, nothing worse.\nThe foreign patient, though, had to know the exact cause of this to reenter his home country on the continent. At first this foreigner thought the strange vape that he\u2019d bought at a local souvenir shop\u2014which put out smoke that made the landscape look slightly more colorful than the reality for the inhaler, and thus was advised to be used outside the island to avoid confusion\u2014was to blame and made the authority talk to the proprietor. But after various tests the vape was concluded to be irrelevant.\n\u201cOne tourist, one colorful, two patterned. The patients\u2019 lifestyles don\u2019t seem to overlap. What did they do to get this thing?\u201d Kiriko remarked, back at the atelier, flopping onto her back on the cushions.\nHer mentor sat down beside her. \u201cIt\u2019s not doing much to the patient, so there may be many more who are suffering unaware from the same thing or no one else at all. Too few cases so far.\u201d\nThere was then a beep at the door and when Kiriko answered it was Mr. Hama. \u201cHow is it going? When can I rid of this itch in my ear?\u201d he said, as he climbed the raised floor of the atelier\u2019s reception.\nKiriko grumbled and her mentor looked away without a word.\n\u201cOkay, I see,\u201d Mr. Hama said. \u201cHere, have some sweet things. Sugar makes your brains work better, as they say.\u201d\nKiriko went off to make tea immediately.\nThe client laughed and placed the small box on the low table. \u201cWe got some of these from our own client, and they tasted quite good. So I went to the shop and bought a packet myself.\u201d He lifted the lid of the simple but carefully wrapped thing. \u201cVery savory and beautiful, and the texture . . . \u201d he trailed off when he saw the expression on the face of the owner of the atelier.\n\u201cApprentice,\u201d he called to Kiriko, \u201cturn off that stove now and come back here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNow.\u201d\n\u201cBut sensei,\u201d Kiriko came out of the kitchen almost pouting, \u201cwe always need some tea when we\u2014\u201d\nShe stopped right beside her mentor.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Mr. Hama.\n\u201cHama-san,\u201d Kiriko said, \u201cyou have to tell us where you got these candied agar pieces, now.\u201d\nThe confectionery shop that made the candied agar, the bar serving a glass of smoky-purple liquor, an auntie who wanted to give her nephew some inks to play with, and a florist who experimented with the color of their roses, they all had procured their pigment from the same place\u2014the community bulletin board. The clinic pinned the exact source after a day, and a nurse got back to the atelier with some air of . . . embarrassment.\n\u201cShe is . . . a mistake,\u201d said the nurse with a feathery deep-blue hair, perched neatly on the edge of the raised reception floor.\n\u201cA mistake? Who is?\u201d\nRui the nurse sipped his tea. Kiriko wondered if his real name was Ruri after his hair color, one consonant omitted for easier pronunciation for the foreigners. \u201cWe call her Ash, we don\u2019t know her real name. She is the person in charge of the crematorium\u2019s lab. She is an ando, and she is, we believe, a little bit broken.\u201d\n\u201cRui-san, are you ando-san, too?\u201d asked Kiriko.\n\u201cYes. How can you tell?\u201d\n\u201cJust the way you talk about this Ash character, I guess.\u201d\nHer mentor cut in. \u201cThe city crematorium has a laboratory?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, do you think the city would let patterns that can be found on bones just go to waste?\u201d\n\u201cWe would think you\u2019d do just that, yes, rather than violating somebody else\u2019s body,\u201d said Kiriko, not trying one bit to hide her disgust.\nRui looked embarrassed, for a moment. \u201cOnly those with patterns are confiscated, just for a day or so. The city wants to archive any rare patterns and colors, even those found on the bones. We\u2019d have liked to collect the colors on them, too, but we\u2019ve never seen colored ones.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cWe haven\u2019t. But I cannot speak for Ash.\u201d As if he didn\u2019t want to count Ash as one of them.\nSilence hung for a while. \u201cWould you go see Ash,\u201d Rui said at length, \u201cand find out where she is obtaining these weird pigments?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you do that yourself?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Rui bit his lip. \u201cWe don\u2019t get along. Please.\u201d\nAnd the two craftspersons had to say yes.\nThe craftspersons saw immediately what Rui had meant by a mistake. Ash was a very mildly colored person, her pale skin having very, very slight shimmer as she changed angles, like there were tiny crystal grains deep down. Too subtle even for an ando.\n\u201cRui called and said I\u2019d be interviewed by two colorless people!\u201d Ash beamed as she opened the door to her office for them. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d\n\u201cAbout the pigments,\u201d the owner of the atelier said.\nAsh clapped her hands as if this was the most surprising thing she had heard all day. \u201cOh yes! All the colors are confiscated now. How unfortunate.\u201d There was no remorse in her tone, apparently. Kiriko wondered if this, too, was a reason for Ash to be called a mistake by her peers.\nHer mentor cleared his throat. \u201cWe are just here to see how you got those strange pigments.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that. They are the by-product of the pattern extracting process. I wasn\u2019t sure how I should be rid of them, and also, they are lovely, aren\u2019t they? I wouldn\u2019t have liked to just drain them down the pipe and let them go to waste.\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask the city what to do with them?\u201d asked Kiriko.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me to, did they? All they said was to find the patterns to archive them.\u201d\nThe owner of the atelier cleared his throat again, eyeing his apprentice. Then he said, \u201cCan we have a look at your equipment? We just want to make really sure that your pigments are what is causing this fuss, and . . . that . . . nobody is tampering with them, so to say, on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d Ash didn\u2019t seem to understand what he was implying. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give you a tour of this tiny room. So, let\u2019s start with this cupboard, where we put the ingredients . . . \u201d\nThe procedures and the chemicals Ash used were unfamiliar to the craftspersons, but as far as they could see, there seemed to be nothing that implicated Ash\u2019s wrongdoing. She was using some kind of marker chemical on the pattern and a custom-built camera to reproduce how it would appear were it drawn on a flat surface instead of bones of various shapes. It seemed the chemicals were somehow washing the pigment grains off the bones when they were exposed to the camera. Kiriko picked up a piece of bone out of a tray, and Ash chuckled. When the craftsperson cocked her head inquisitively Ash said, \u201cNo human ever held a bone like that.\u201d\n\u201cOh. When you put it like that. I\u2019m just, well, seeing this as an object of research right now.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know!\u201d\nKiriko smiled and then looked at the bone again. \u201cSensei,\u201d she said to her mentor, \u201cI have this feeling . . . \u201d\nHe took another piece without a word. The two examined the bones for a while, from this angle and that, as round-eyed Ash silently watched. \u201cCan we study these in our own lab?\u201d he finally asked, \u201cwe promise we won\u2019t do any damage.\u201d\nAsh shrugged. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\nAfter looking at them through their own microscope, the craftspersons agreed that the submerged pigment presence through the bones were strangely uneven. If they\u2019d come from one single person\u2014they certainly had to\u2014the trace of the impression of the color should have been present more or less homogenously. But with these bones, the pigment was scattered in a few places where it was very strong, while other parts were completely devoid of them. It was as though someone had injected them, though there was no needle scar or anything of the kind.\nAnd for that matter . . . they had been, in fact, thoroughly surprised to find any pigment in bones at all. They\u2019d seen people with patterns on their bones and teeth, yes. But never anyone with homogeneously colored bones; they\u2019d have seen those appear on teeth, or through thin and soft skin, if there ever were. They\u2019d both assumed, without saying it aloud, that bones were too hard to retain enough pigment portions. Even after finding these uneven spots, they were finding it hard to believe it.\nThe clinic obtained the medical history and other reports about the deceased in question, but they could find nothing that might be relevant.\n\u201cMeanwhile,\u201d Sakata said on the phone, \u201cthe city decided to just dispose of the colors extracted from the bones. The colors they confiscated so far don\u2019t seem to include those worth archiving, over the risk of putting them into one place and making them more harmful. As they are at the moment, the worst thing that can happen is a few people experiencing mild discomfort. And even that\u2019s only when the affected actually touch the pigments. Down the river, or deep within the soil, the strange pigments won\u2019t do much, the city reasoned.\u201d\nKiriko scowled. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know enough about these pigments to just let it pass. For once, I don\u2019t think we colorless will be affected by them. Looks like they stir the balance of elements just when they collide with colors and patterns on human body. For that one foreign tourist, we are guessing here that the residual phantom colors from the souvenir vape reacted with Ash\u2019s pigment, and we islanders, either colorful or colorless, never take those smokes in ourselves.\u201d\nThere was a pause, and Sakata sighed. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll try to talk them out of it. Will you help me if they need any evidence or proof?\u201d\n\u201cAny time, Doctor, though I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll listen to us colorless folks.\u201d She laughed bitterly and hung up.\nThe owner of the atelier was drawing something on the low table of the reception, sipping his tea. \u201cSakata looks like a man who knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he has very nice colors. He might be able to talk sense into those lazy city officials. Especially if the colorful and patterned are more prone to damage in this particular case.\u201d\n\u201cHopefully.\u201d She leaned on the pillar. \u201cThose bones. I still cannot believe these dead pigments come from the person\u2019s native color. Can you?\u201d She saw her mentor shake his head slowly. \u201cThe extracted pigments are the by-product of the lab\u2019s work, as Ash said? If the color is so easy to leak out of bone, it should also be as easy the other way round\u2014for one to have colors in bone. But clearly things we\u2019ve seen over the years indicate otherwise. Where did Ash\u2019s dead pigments come from, for real?\u201d\nHer mentor placed his elbow on the table and rested his cheek on his knuckle. \u201cHm,\u201d he said. Then he said, \u201cHm.\u201d\nThe first thing the next morning, Kiriko was heading for the crematorium\u2019s lab, to return the bones; they argued all night, but decided there was nothing more they could do with the actual bones, anyway. Now that they were no longer the research subject, it felt so wrong to be holding them. The receptionist at the crematorium waved her into the lab annex, and when she walked through the door, Kiriko heard someone shout. Alarmed, she sprinted toward Ash\u2019s office.\nWithout knocking, she slid the door to the full, and found Rui the nurse ready to strike Ash. \u201cHey!\u201d Kiriko yelled at the top of her already exhausted lungs.\nLuckily that was enough to pull Rui back to himself, it seemed. He looked more surprised than either of the other two in the room, blinked at his own hand as if he couldn\u2019t believe it was where it was, midair over the other ando.\n\u201cAsh, do you want me to report this?\u201d Kiriko said, still panting.\n\u201cNo no, please, let me explain,\u201d Rui\u2019s voice was shaken like he was the one who was almost hit.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you!\u201d\nAsh raised her hand. \u201cCraftsperson! Please, there is an explanation for this!\u201d Then she cocked her head. \u201cI mean, he does have one!\u201d\nKiriko glared at Rui. \u201cWhatever it is, I don\u2019t want a nurse in our clinic who is ready to hurt someone else!\u201d\n\u201cTea!\u201d Ash screamed. \u201cLet\u2019s talk over a cup of tea!\u201d\nAsh duly made tea and poured a cup each for the very perplexed Kiriko and tired-looking Rui. When she sat down with her own cup Ash said, \u201cRui says I\u2019m violating.\u201d\n\u201cBecause you are!\u201d\nKiriko put a hand between the two andos. \u201cViolating what?\u201d\n\u201cRules,\u201d replied Rui, \u201cand a corpse.\u201d\nThe craftsperson hastily put her wrapping cloth with the bones in it on the table and pushed it a little toward Ash. \u201cA corpse?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not violating it! I\u2019m just dividing it into chunks, so that I can give it proper cremation.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d\nThe two andos looked at each other, then at the craftsperson. \u201cAsh is hiding a body in her fridge,\u201d Rui said. \u201cThe body of an android, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s a murderer.\u201d\n\u201cOh all right,\u201d Kiriko said through her teeth, \u201cit is so reassuring to hear that she didn\u2019t murder anybody, thank you. But I\u2019d appreciate if you\u2019d elaborate just a little more.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an old friend of mine.\u201d Ash didn\u2019t seem to hear Kiriko\u2019s sarcasm. \u201cA very old model, the city terminated it a long time ago. I wanted to give it a respectful funeral, but they wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t let you?\u201d\n\u201cThe city, of course.\u201d\n\u201cSo you made your friend into chunks and . . . ?\u201d\nAsh spread her hands. \u201cPut them one by one into someone\u2019s coffin. That way it wouldn\u2019t cost too much energy.\u201d\nRui sighed loudly.\nKiriko\u2019s brows were starting to ache. \u201cAnd you never mentioned that to the city\u2014the owner of this crematorium? Or the family of the deceased?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Should I?\u201d\nKiriko looked at Rui. He shrugged. But then he sobered and said, \u201cThat is very obscene, Ash, I think. You should stop doing that immediately, as I\u2019ve said many times before. I knew it would all come down to this, sooner or later. I\u2019m sure the craftsperson here agrees.\u201d He cast a meaningful glance Kiriko\u2019s way.\n\u201cWhy? How so? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nThe craftsperson pushed the bundle of bones farther toward Ash. \u201cOkay, now I think that is how those pigments got into the bones. Been burned in, so to speak. You ando-san have a body part for collecting organic colors, right? Many of you\u2014at least those who work for the National Archives\u2014have color receptors hidden in your body.\u201d\nRui looked bewildered. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked with one of you before.\u201d That was how the city clandestinely collected the information on what colors and patterns the islanders bore on their skin, to know the current situation, and to store color/pattern compositions and structures in their secret database. \u201cAsh, were you aware that your friend\u2019s chunks were contaminating the locals\u2019 bodies?\u201d\nAsh blinked a few times and looked down at her cup. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d\nKiriko and Rui both had to believe that.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve recently started putting the parts around the color receptors in, I presume?\u201d Kiriko said at length.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Ash was now looking at her hands.\nRui sighed again. \u201cAsh, are you looking worried for those humans who were affected, or are you just sad because your friend might have caused something bad?\u201d\nKiriko turned to the nurse. \u201cRui, you don\u2019t have to be so harsh!\u201d\n\u201cNo? Ash was just lucky that those dead pigments are not harmful enough, right?\u201d\n\u201cOh come on, she works here as a researcher. Surely she would have known if something went too wrong.\u201d\nRui had nothing to say to that. They sat in silence for a while, after which Ash said, \u201cI might have missed something on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Kiriko intoned, her cup to her lips.\n\u201cI mean . . . I would have liked my friend to go on. In a way, in other people\u2019s bodies, as the dead pigments spread over the city. If I couldn\u2019t give it a proper farewell.\u201d\nRui snickered, but Kiriko laughed, just a little. She couldn\u2019t help it. \u201cYou are talking like a very, very sentimental human being.\u201d\n\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have terminated my friend. It did go a bit insane toward the end, yes, but that was mostly due to the program the city made it install on itself. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nNothing was fair in this city, Kiriko thought, but kept her mouth shut.\n\u201cWe have to report this,\u201d Rui said, as if grinding his teeth on the painful silence.\nIt was Kiriko\u2019s turn to snicker. \u201cWhat, and let them realize that their damned colorful and patterned dignity have been tampered with, for who knows how long?\u201d\n\u201cBut we cannot let her go on like this!\u201d\nKiriko looked at Ash, who was still staring at her own hands. \u201cGive me and my mentor some time to consider this,\u201d she said and extended her hand toward Ash, so that the ando would see the craftsperson\u2019s hand instead. \u201cAsh, listen. Please stop doing what you\u2019ve been doing, just for the moment. We\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d\nAsh nodded. Kiriko had known andos could be sentimental, yes, but this really wasn\u2019t fair\u2014now Ash was making Kiriko sentimental and even protective, too.\nBack at the atelier, Kiriko found her mentor waiting right behind the door, looking very pleased. \u201cHow long have you been standing there like a fool, sensei?\u201d she asked him.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been talking with Sakata,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were saying, we could have a joint venture, to develop some kind of filter, to completely detoxify those dead pigments. This will be an ongoing project, which might bring us a lot of money on a regular basis, and reputation as the city\u2019s important supplier!\u201d\nKiriko considered this, as she involuntarily made a face.\n\u201cOh, come on. Whatever you found out today at Ash\u2019s place, this detoxification surely needs to be made, right?\u201d\nKiriko said, \u201cTea?\u201d\nHer stomach was already heavy with it, but she forced herself to drink, anyway. Her mentor emptied his cup in one gulp. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to report that to the city,\u201d he said sullenly, after hearing his apprentice out. \u201cAsh can just keep on doing what she\u2019s doing, while we sell those filters to the city and the clinic.\u201d\n\u201cRui knows. I don\u2019t think ando-san are generally built to lie. And do you think that is what Ash wants? Burning her friend chunk by chunk?\u201d\nHe glared at the dregs of his tea. \u201cBut . . . \u201d\n\u201cSensei.\u201d She patted his arm and made him look at her. \u201cIf it were me dead in the fridge, would you be happy throwing my body secretly, bits by bits, never having the proper moments of mourning?\u201d She swallowed. \u201cBecause if it were you, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nAt that, he averted his eyes and then closed them for one moment. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nAs soon as Sakata gave them the name of the city\u2019s representative, the craftspersons went to the city hall itself, to see this person for themselves. They never talked to this person, of course, but took notes of the person\u2019s colors and patterns, which were the flashes of mosaic of many intensities of champagne. These colors appeared only when the person\u2019s skin wrinkled, around their eyes or wrists and parts like those. One of the atelier\u2019s clients overheard this person complain at an izakaya, after drinking too much, that they should be treated as a more colorful person, not as a tepid civil servant.\nOn the big day, Sakata was frowning as he walked out of the city hall after the meeting. \u201cI did my best,\u201d he said when he saw the two craftspersons seated on a bench on the pavement. \u201cI was surprised to hear that the city used to dump the broken ando parts onto a landfill like some unburnable trash until quite recently, those that they cannot reuse. That\u2019s what would have happened if this Ash ando didn\u2019t refuse, right?\u201d He took a breath and shook his head. \u201cThey did say they don\u2019t even terminate andos anymore, so something like Ash\u2019s friend won\u2019t happen again. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but show the surprise.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay, of course. We aren\u2019t asking you to deceive them.\u201d The owner of the atelier slowly stood up. \u201cYou did tell them to choose between Ash having her way this once or taking us in as their regular, long-time supplier of the detoxifying method, right?\u201d\nSakata nodded. \u201cThey argued they could just replace Ash and be done with it.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Kiriko said, rising to her feet, too, \u201chow did you retort to that?\u201d\n\u201cI thought about how Rui and other ando nurses talked about Ash. Like she was a mistake. No other department with ando staff will be able to find another use for her, I told them. And that if they don\u2019t keep her in place and properly watched, she\u2019ll just wander about telling people of the bone violating\u2014by her, and by the city, too.\u201d Sakata rubbed his brows. \u201cNot that I think it\u2019s right, but I suppose it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Kiriko smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cThank you, Doctor. We knew we could rely on you.\u201d\nSakata laughed. \u201cI really did wish you two were there with me.\u201d\n\u201cIf we were there with you the city person wouldn\u2019t have listened, not even to you.\u201d\n\u201cSo you two think it all worked? That they\u2019ll let Ash do what she wants?\u201d\nKiriko\u2019s mentor sighed. \u201cThey want to think they are so much different from us, in a much higher place than us. They\u2019re bound to choose an ando over us having our way.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so.\u201d Sakata sighed back. \u201cAgain, not that I think it\u2019s right.\u201d\nAnd that was what happened of course\u2014a few days later Ash received notification from the city, their permission for her to use one of the incinerators just for her friend. As per Sakata\u2019s recommendation, the city ordered the pattern atelier to create a solution to prevent the leaking of the dead pigments fromthe coffin. The National Archives had the blueprint of Ash\u2019s friend, and Ash remembered precisely what parts of her friend had already been consumed along with strangers. Kiriko and her mentor didn\u2019t have to look at the body in person or touch it directly\u2014it didn\u2019t feel right to cut into the privacy of Ash and her friend, and also, it would have been quite a thing, actually seeing defrosted parts of an almost-human body.\nThe craftspersons made an embroidered shroud, with a pattern that would sooth and supplement the wavelength of the shadow of colors left in the body. The threads used were also absorbed in a specifically prepared concoction of inks, and an agent; they would add viscosity to the leakage, making it harder to flow away and be lost in the environment.\n\u201cWould you be there?\u201d asked Ash when she came to pick up the shroud at the atelier. She personally paid for it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d\nKiriko could feel that her mentor wanted to say no straight away\u2014they\u2019d managed to evade interacting with the corpse by using the blueprint and Ash\u2019s memory, why would they want to be present at the crematorium with the mutilated body among them, after all? \u201cOf course we would be there with you,\u201d she said, before her mentor could utter a sound, \u201cto see your beloved friend off. After such a long time.\u201d\nHer mentor didn\u2019t protest. He knew that she wanted him, or herself, to have a choice between being alone and not, when the time came for themselves.\nOn that day, Rui was there, too, still in his clinic clothes. He probably sneaked out between shifts. \u201cYou fools,\u201d he said and placed a hand on his hip.\nKiriko had to laugh to that. \u201cThanks to you, too,\u201d replied the craftsperson, being sarcastic but also meaning it. \u201cFor not getting in our way. I know you could have.\u201d\nRui looked away and said, \u201cIt\u2019d just be a waste of time, arguing over this.\u201d\nTo the craftspersons\u2019 relief, Ash had already wrapped the body with the shroud by the time they all gathered around the coffin lined with the filters. Kiriko and her mentor drew small patterns around the edge of the wood as finishing touches, just in case. The body was arranged there like a specimen, with a lot of its parts missing but otherwise in perfect order of a human body. Its face was intact, and it looked as though Ash\u2019s friend was just sleeping\u2014not the figure of speech but like really just . . . sleeping. Kiriko thought she might understand why Ash couldn\u2019t simply get rid of it, just a little.\nWhile they waited for the incineration to finish, Ash talked ceaselessly about her late friend. Rui rolled his eyes many times, Kiriko laughed a lot, and her mentor quietly listened and refilled their teacups. There was no ceremonial air, no real speech, no crying involved. But it was as proper a funeral as any other."}

People would write in and respond to the stories or articles published in recent issues. There weren\u2019t websites or email addresses, so dropping an envelope in the mail was your only chance to let the editors know what you were thinking. I was part of the silent majority, one of the people who never wrote in.\n Clarkesworld is a child of the digital age, born online and with limited print distribution. We\u2019ve never had the need for a letters column. People can post comments on our site or reach out to me via email, but despite the ease of such things over mailing a letter, such interactions remain quite uncommon. These days, most of the responses to a magazine is indirect and happening through social media, podcasts, and blogs. The community is more scattered and that can have the effect of depersonalizing things. It\u2019s neither better nor worse. It\u2019s simply different.\n Last month made me notice how much I miss that old-fashioned direct line of communication. It seems as though my editorial struck a chord with readers and inspired many of you to reach out directly with thoughts, advice, and other demonstrations of support or concern. Scattered among the business advice and ideas were birthday wishes and a common theme of a desire to help make everything work for us. It was well-timed and inspired me to undertake a survey\u2014which ended with over a thousand participants\u2014on magazine funding and business models. The comments there built on what the emails started and while at times very blunt, said what needed to be said. Thank you!\n Between my birthday, Worldcon, and my inevitable post-Worldcon crash, I haven\u2019t had time to do the full analysis of that data. The preliminary results and all the comments have been interesting and very informative. I\u2019ll likely spend a lot of time this month going over the finer points and using them to shape the direction this magazine will take as it enters into its next decade. I don\u2019t want that to be the end of the discussion though. Please, stay in touch. We love hearing from you.\n Normally, I\u2019d end an editorial about here, but as I mentioned, Worldcon was last month. Much of it is a blur, but there are some high points I\u2019d like to quickly mention before I sign-off:\n \n Congratulations to Naomi Kritzer! Her story \u201cCat Pictures Please,\u201d from our January 2015 issue, won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story. We\u2019ve had many stories make the ballot, but Naomi is our first Hugo winner and we couldn\u2019t be happier for her.\n This was my fourth Hugo nomination for Best Editor Short Form. This year, I placed third behind Ellen Datlow and Sheila Williams, two amazing editors I\u2019ve long admired. It\u2019s my best finish in this category, so thank you to everyone that voted for me.\n Much to my surprise, the Association of Science Fiction & Fantasy Artists (ASFA) presented me with a Chesley Award for Best Art Director. I\u2019m very flattered to have received this honor and am still in shock. Thanks to all the ASFA members!\n I once again had the opportunity to spend time with our colleagues from Storycom and discuss the future of our Chinese translation project. Short version: we\u2019re all very happy to continue working on this and have plans to expand it to some related projects in the near future. More to come!\n Midamericon II was a very well-run convention. Every event has its ups and downs, but the ups far outnumbered the downs. I\u2019ll remember this one quite favorably.\n \n Have a great September and see you next month for the start of Clarkesworld\u2019s 10th anniversary year!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

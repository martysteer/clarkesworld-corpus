And for something this long-term in a place as small as Longyearbyen, you needed domestic cover, or people started to suspect you for keeping apart.\n The locals were out of the question, and once we were under review it was more than my life was worth to try to smuggle someone over if they didn\u2019t already have some international clearance.\n (\u201cUnder review\u201d: the Global Coalition was interested enough in Svalbard to station spies at the ports.)\n Lise had been a loose affiliate of my organization, years back. She\u2019d dropped off the map, but it only took two tries to contact her, and one meeting to convince her.\n \u201cGood choice,\u201d said the guy who\u2019d met her, when he called weeks later to seal the deal. \u201cShe\u2019s got contacts at the mine at Sveagruva. She\u2019s already on a plane to Oslo; she\u2019ll catch a boat out to you next week.\u201d\n The rest of the timeline was already set, for the short-term: quick public courtship, cohabitation. When our orders came in, she\u2019d make the initial runs off the island, and then once there was a routine in place she could quietly vanish whenever things soured.\n Until then she would live with me on Svalbard and keep an eye on Coalition business in town and whatever the mining company turned up.\n I would keep making visits to the Seed Vault, taking inventory, ticking off names on my list, waiting for the day when I\u2019d get the order to move out two or three seeds at a time and pass them off to whoever the highest bidders sent to collect.\n (The day I was really waiting for was the day I could tell someone, \u201cThis one\u2019s drying up. We\u2019ll be looking for some decent soil, to grow it for re-harvest,\u201d and have their eyes light up, too.)\n \u201cCoalition Peacekeepers just showed up\u2014they blocked the port,\u201d Lise says, knocking mud off her boots. \u201cThey\u2019ve already dispatched a zoo team to look for polar bears.\u201d\n I whistle. \u201cHow many of them?\u201d\n \u201cEnough to make sure you don\u2019t get one fucking seed out of here,\u201d she says. \u201cGood luck.\u201d\n (She was a decent recruit\u2014she\u2019d done admin at the Millennium Seed Bank before it got militarized, had some clearance, had some brains\u2014but she wasn\u2019t a believer, and it showed.)\n I frown at the printout in front of me\u2014scientific names and common names and country of origin marching in four-point font for two hundred pages.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way around it,\u201d I say. \u201cThis could just be like the review. It could be years before we have to worry.\u201d\n We plan in years.\n She shoulders her rifle. \u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d\n Rifles are standard issue in Longyearbyen, one of the few places you can still get one. It\u2019s required outside the city, for protection against polar bears.\n (She mostly goes out to the bird cliffs and takes shots at poachers.)\n \u201cDon\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d I say. We need to keep cover.\n A gust of cold wind, and she\u2019s gone.\n Absently, I check off Acer palmatum on the list, but my concentration is already gone, and I end up staring out the window at the shadows that gather inside shadows all over this place at night.\n I don\u2019t notice the Peacekeeper boats have moved into place until someone inside one turns on a light.\n We measure time two ways.\n One is the paper calendar I get at Christmas from the woman who poses, twice a year, as my sister.\n Longyearbyen went nearly paperless after the Global Coalition\u2019s Environmental Imperative was released. (We had to preserve any trees that would grow, it said; now that the waters were rising, arable land was sacrosanct.)\n Tax on physical mail was obscene, but the calendar was how I received most of my instructions, so I paid.\n One random day a year was \u201cSemiramis (observed)\u201d\u2014the day I sent my ID over a landline, by voice.\n I chose the name; she was the queen for whom they\u2019d built the hanging gardens in Babylon.\n By then I had started to care.\n \u201cHappy Semiramis,\u201d Lise always said when she checked off that calendar day, in a tone that made me feel like I was giving away too much.\n It was the only paper in the house, save the printout of the Seed Vault inventory. That had been granted exemption\u2014pulp for the good of the nation.\n Lise was the one who started ticking off days on the calendar, the very first year she arrived.\n I hadn\u2019t asked why. We didn\u2019t like each other enough back then to get into a round of questions, and by the time we\u2019d reached a truce it wasn\u2019t worth asking. In this line of work, you learn just to live with people.\n The other way we keep time is by tracking how much coal is worth.\n Most of the coal mined on Svalbard went directly into the air conditioners at the Seed Vault, to keep the temperature at a constant zero Fahrenheit. The price of coal went up the warmer it got outside, and the more of it we needed, the less of it there was.\n This was the calendar we kept for the rest of the world, to measure how bad things were getting.\n Two years back, Lise had come home and said, \u201cWe passed gold on the index. Things must be rough down South.\u201d\n \u201cDid the Coalition do anything?\u201d\n \u201cWe got an embargo\u2014no export under threat of treason,\u201d she said, shrugged. The coal was meant for the Vault, not for sale, and Svalbard was already under review; it wasn\u2019t as though anything got off the island anyway, unless the Norwegian government found some country down South with the money to buy.\n (Down South: anywhere beneath the Arctic line, where water levels were rising and cities were being swallowed up. Shanghai and New York had gone early, London and Copenhagen a few years later. The Maldives had vanished right off the map. Their government operated out of Mumbai until that went under, too.\n The whole South was just governments sprinting for high ground, these days.)\n After the Peacekeepers come, I don\u2019t see her for two days.\n The Sveagruva mine is battening down in the wake of the Peacekeepers, and she works long hours up there. Sometimes it\u2019s easier just to sleep over.\n I go out to the Seed Vault every day, in the bright green parka that makes me look like a tourist. I leave the Snow Cat and walk the last mile (less threatening), and try not to stare at the ships.\n It\u2019s surprising how high the water has risen. My first year, passing ships had been so low I could look down onto their decks; now they\u2019re nearly eye level.\n The Peacekeepers are already stationed outside, asking my business.\n That\u2019s a mistake. If you ask someone about their business, they might tell you.\n (Years back, when I was still so new that I worried how I\u2019d ever overcome my apathy about seed packets in a fucking basement, some botanists came to drop off seeds. One of them talked at me for twenty minutes about the runaway metabolism of Castanea sativa.\n \u201cCan you imagine a future without chestnuts?\u201d she said, and handed me the envelope, and sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s so precarious, now, with so few species allowed to grow at all. This is the last surviving breed\u2014the very last.\u201d\n I looked at the woman in mild terror. I already knew that I was doomed to be interested one day; that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t an awful thing to anticipate.\n Norway sealed Svalbard to donations a year after that. By the time I\u2019d developed interest, I was alone.)\n I give the Peacekeepers a more detailed description of my business than anyone has ever wanted.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the recalcitrant seeds that we really have to watch out for,\u201d I explain about five minutes in, and then I start on runaway metabolism and desiccation effects and where we\u2019ll be when we can\u2019t grow chestnuts any more, and the Peacekeepers look at me pretty much the way I\u2019d expected them to.\n Still, they move aside.\n I ask them, \u201cWhere\u2019s home for you?\u201d\n \u201cScotland.\u201d\n \u201cHow are things there?\u201d\n They don\u2019t answer.\n (No answer: Under occupation, or under water.)\n Inside, I\u2019m relieved beyond reason the Tuberaria guttata seeds are doing well.\n It had been drowned out of the Mediterranean and Wales and the States years back. This sample had been harvested from Scotland, and it doesn\u2019t sound like there are going to be many more chances at it.\n When I come home, Lise is sitting in front of the little coal stove, still in her yellow coat.\n It\u2019s a comfort. We\u2019ve lived together for nearly eight years, and after a while you just get used to seeing someone.\n (The first time I was embedded somewhere I fell in love with my domestic-cover operative. It went badly. I\u2019ve learned not to overthink these things.)\n I hang my coat. \u201cHow has it gone? Peacekeepers giving you trouble yet?\u201d\n \u201cTheir ships are upsetting the fish,\u201d she says. \u201cThe birds are just circling. Bad enough that the cliffs are disappearing underwater. Now they\u2019ll starve, too.\u201d\n The bird-cliffs are covered this time of year, auks and terns and kittiwakes. I went out there once, with Lise, to check out escape routes. It was a chaos of feathers and noise and the green and yellow lights of the Aurora, and I left as soon as I realized it would be impossible to scale the cliffs.\n Lise goes back all the time.\n (One year, early on, she brought back a tern that had been on the bad end of a fight, and she fed and warmed it all night until it died. Then she took the body outside. What she did with it she never said, and I didn\u2019t ask. You learn to just live with people.)\n I make coffee on the stove, keep one eye on her face as her expression gets darker.\n By the time I sit next to her, I\u2019ve made up my mind.\n \u201cI brought this,\u201d I say, and pull an envelope out of my pocket.\n It\u2019s an archival envelope, unlabeled; inside is a single seed.\n \u201cTuberaria guttata. Spotted rock rose. The flowers last less than a day. This one\u2019s from Scotland, but it sounds like they\u2019ve drowned by now. These are going to be worth a lot of money.\u201d\n She hasn\u2019t taken the seed out. She\u2019s just looking at it still tucked inside the envelope. I didn\u2019t think her expression could get darker, but I was wrong.\n \u201cHave the orders come in?\u201d she asks.\n I should have expected concern. She thinks she\u2019s been cut out of the loop.\n \u201cNo, no,\u201d I say. \u201cStill waiting to hear. I just\u2014I wanted to bring this one out. Call it a dry run.\u201d\n \u201cAre you going to sell it?\u201d\n Suspicion I hadn\u2019t expected.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I snap. \u201cI just wanted you to see it.\u201d\n She looks up at that. I freeze and wait; if she calls it a present, I\u2019ll deny it to the death.\n But she only says, \u201cIsn\u2019t it enough you\u2019ll be taking out the others?\u201d\n She\u2019s not a believer, and it shows.\n I pluck the envelope out of her hand.\n \u201cTwo million seeds,\u201d I say. \u201cWill they really miss one?\u201d\n \u201cThere used to be two million birds,\u201d she says. Her voice is strained, like she\u2019s trying not to care.\n We sit in silence until the fire goes down and the cabin\u2019s warm enough to sleep in.\n (We sleep in the same bed. This is too long-term an arrangement to be a gentleman and sleep on the couch. You plan in years.)\n It takes six weeks before Peacekeepers and Svalbard locals have finished jostling for territory.\n It means the worst, of course\u2014no one\u2019s under illusions. It means that \u201cunder review\u201d has turned into \u201cCoalition Protectorate\u201d in some back room in some inland country, and the highest-bidding corporation will be moving in to take over the coal mines, and soon the Svalbard Seed Vault will be powered by Mainland Oil or MediaVox.\n It means my orders are going to come through any day, so we can have a little of our own back before the MediaVox Seed Vault opens for business.\n I go every day, now, just to keep the Peacekeepers used to my face.\n Lise comes home from the mine, shoulders her rifle, goes out again. I don\u2019t know where. The Peacekeepers are crowding us out wherever they can.\n By now I\u2019m staying up nights, too, researching what nations have gone under one way or another.\n It\u2019s really something how hard the Coalition works to keep its member nations separated. Once they get their import taxes and their offshore data charges and their streaming-feed embargoes on you, there\u2019s no communicating with anyone\u2014you might as well be submerged in the sea.\n You have to strike early, before the locals have submitted to all the red tape.\n You have to act before they know to stop you.\n Semiramis comes.\n I make the call from the loudest pub in town.\n \u201cIt\u2019s soon,\u201d my fake sister says. \u201cBe ready to move out past the Peacekeepers.\u201d\n I snap, \u201cThen Lise will have to swim, because these boats aren\u2019t budging. We need time.\u201d\n \u201cWe need at least one good run,\u201d she says, \u201cto make this worth it. It has to be soon.\u201d\n We argue about Peacekeepers for a minute or two in low voices, and then I talk nonsense about the weather for another five minutes, just in case.\n (It\u2019s not all nonsense\u2014I tell her about the sea level, and she says, \u201cWe moved,\u201d and I imagine the overpacked cities picking themselves up, buildings and all, and climbing the mountain as the water rises.)\n When I come home, Lise doesn\u2019t tell me, \u201cHappy Semiramis.\u201d\n I can hardly be offended, but this is the first time I notice that she stopped marking days a long time ago. That worries me.\n I don\u2019t mention yet that our time to act is coming. I have a feeling I\u2019d better have a plan before I try to get her in on it.\n I\u2019m beginning to understand the frustration of not knowing everything. My fake sister hasn\u2019t told me what they think the Coalition will do to me, when they find out what\u2019s happened.\n It\u2019s a when, not an if. Lise has been positioned to survive, as a condition of her participation. There\u2019s no such provision for me. Never has been. Sometimes when you take a job, it\u2019s your last one.\n Still, I make a few more dry runs, just to keep in practice for when my orders come.\n I pick some seeds that will grow in any soil (as dumb as it is, I still want to plant something, once, and watch it grow). I pick some seeds because they\u2019re rare enough to make a decent bribe if things go south.\n I pick a bird of paradise, a seed with a sharp red tuft, for no reason except that it\u2019s been ten years since I\u2019ve seen anything red; the Aurora is yellow and green, and the rest of the world is the tight dark of seeds, and envelopes paler than skin.\n I should have planned a little more, for when this started to creep over me, but there\u2019s no knowing how it will creep up on you until you look at a tufted seed and blink at how bright it is.\n I didn\u2019t even look up what happened to the Hanging Gardens until after I had picked the name. Turns out the ground swallowed them, but what can you do?\n Every time I bring something home I hand her the envelope, so she can\u2019t say I held out on her.\n She should know what she\u2019s doing when the time comes, and she should know the worth of what she\u2019s carrying. I don\u2019t plead anybody\u2019s case\u2014I\u2019m not like that botanist with the chestnuts. This is business.\n Usually she only glances inside. I tell her what they are and what long-gone country they came from, and she gets that drawn, sad look I\u2019m starting to see in the mirror.\n Once, she opens the envelope and says instantly, \u201cBird of paradise.\u201d\n I\u2019m so surprised I smile.\n She hands it back \u201cThat\u2019s a slow grow. Good luck getting it to the blooming stage.\u201d\n \u201cYou never know,\u201d I say.\n (We plan in years.)\n As part of the negotiations to keep everyone in Svalbard from turning on them, the Coalition ships finally move back out of fishing range.\n They open a big enough gap on the north side of the water for seals and bears to pass; in return, the rifle-bearing locals promise to stop mistaking Peacekeepers for polar bears at night.\n Thousands of birds have died from starvation in the meantime, Lise tells me that night.\n \u201cThe shore under the cliff is a graveyard,\u201d she says.\n \u201cAt least the seals will be fed,\u201d I say.\n Her eyes are red. She doesn\u2019t answer.\n I imagine her skidding through the slush all the way to the cliff, seeing what she saw, and the Peacekeeper boats just out of rifle range.\n I make us coffee.\n A week later, Sveagruva lets its employees go.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just an interim measure,\u201d Lise parrots, \u201cto preserve the facility until new management can be chosen.\u201d\n I nod. \u201cVery reassuring. Doesn\u2019t sound at all like a MediaVox move-in.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d she says. \u201cThis coal brought to you by.\u201d\n She already looks antsy about being cut off from information.\n \u201cLise,\u201d I say, serious. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure a way off Svalbard for you. I\u2019m not going to strand you here. That wasn\u2019t the deal.\u201d\n She slings her rifle over her shoulder, disappears.\n Our orders come in.\n There are a hundred seeds on the list\u2014one good run. They could be carried in someone\u2019s coat pocket, in the fingertips of a pair of gloves, if people were still allowed in or out.\n The new coal boats have clearance, but Lise isn\u2019t employed there any more. Coalition companies start with clean slates.\n \u201cSomehow we have to get you on a ship,\u201d I say.\n She says, like we were having a totally different conversation all along, \u201cAre they going to sell the Vault, do you think?\u201d\n I have no answer. I don\u2019t like where this is going.\n She sits back against the couch, stares at the tiny fire in our tiny stove.\n \u201cAt first I thought they\u2019d sell it off all in one piece, to one of the inland countries that can still grow something. That would be better than nothing. Any growth is better than letting things die\u2014expensive wheat is better than no wheat. That, I would have been all right with. I would have let that happen.\u201d\n She means, I would have turned you in.\n She\u2019s using past tense, so I\u2019m probably fine, but still I look around to make sure she\u2019s not within reach of her gun.\n She sighs. \u201cBut seeing how they\u2019ve managed things,\u201d and when she pauses I know she thinks of the birds, \u201cI wonder if they\u2019re worse than we are, and we\u2019re better off just because we can call a theft a theft.\u201d\n \u201cSpeak for yourself,\u201d I say, though it\u2019s true.\n She pulls something from the inside of her jacket\u2014a seed envelope.\n The little rock rose seed tumbles into her open palm, and for a second I hold my breath like it will sprout.\n (I need a drink.)\n Lise doesn\u2019t look at me. \u201cWhat color does it bloom?\u201d\n \u201cYellow.\u201d\n She nods and curls her fingers around it. I think about telling her to give me my bribe back, but I don\u2019t. It was probably a gift. Happy Semiramis.\n \u201cI\u2019ll join up with the people from the Gene Ark, when they show,\u201d she says. \u201cThey never wait long to barge in and take tissue samples from native species, and they\u2019ll need the help. I can get out that way, and come back as soon as I can.\u201d\n She says it like she\u2019ll actually make it back here, like we haven\u2019t done all this work for a shot at one hundred seeds before the other, smarter thieves close in.\n Still, a hundred plants isn\u2019t bad. A hundred and one\u2014she\u2019ll take hers with her.\n \u201cAll right,\u201d I say.\n After a while she says, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve never been inside the Vault.\u201d\n I sit down beside her. Our shoulders are touching.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a long hallway,\u201d I say, \u201cand then some seeds.\u201d\n We sit awake long after the fire goes out, watching shadows gathering inside shadows, waiting for morning.\n (Inevitably, eventually, you start to care.)\n Genevieve Valentine is a novelist (her most recent is near-future political thriller Icon) and comic book writer, including Catwoman for DC Comics.

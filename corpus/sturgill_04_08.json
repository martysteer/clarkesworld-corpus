Neck lift. Face lift.\n Blepharoplasty\u2014not familiar with the term? Pretend I said eyelid surgery. To make them slant to the outside, that\u2019s all; the exotic look is in. Trust us. You\u2019ll love it. Rhinoplasty\u2014a nose job, that\u2019s all. Not just a reshaping, mind you, but a reimagining. First, we\u2019ll add that beautiful upward tilt (yes, like hers\u2014and hers\u2014and hers), then we\u2019ll reduce the size and narrow the bridge. You may need to breathe through your mouth afterwards, but once we cap your teeth, you\u2019ll thank us for it.\n Next is cosmetic otoplasty\u2014that\u2019s for your ears\u2014followed by collagen injections in your lips and cheeks. Removal of your second chin, and the insertion of an implant to help shape the first one. Permanent laser hair removal below your lower lip, above your upper lip, and for your sideburns too (I can\u2019t believe you have sideburns!). We may as well take off your eyebrows while we are at it. You can draw them on in the future, if you want to go retro. Or schedule a follow-up for replacements, if they come back in style.\n Liposuction\u2019s next, then abdominoplasty (just another word for tummy tuck, girl, no need to worry). After that, we\u2019ll staple your stomach, reshape your buttocks, and make sure your love handles are all-the-way gone\u2014nip and tuck and all that nonsense. You get the idea.\n Of course, there\u2019s still the grand finale, the one no woman would be complete without: breast augmentation. Enlargement and reshaping in your case. In most cases, actually, but that\u2019s not important. All you have to do is show up. We mail you the bill.\n The last day comes and it\u2019s done\u2014you\u2019re done, it\u2019s all downhill from there. Just a few months of rehabilitation, followed by a simple maintenance routine. A chemical peel treatment and derm abrasion therapy every now and then for your complexion, along with the daily, oil-free, skin-exfoliating face wash. And that Hollywood all-liquid seven-day miracle diet? Why not. Couldn\u2019t hurt. Fen-Phen and caffeine pills? Sure. If anything goes wrong, you can always file a lawsuit.\n All right. You\u2019ve been faithful. You\u2019ve done everything you needed to do, and it has worked. You can hardly believe that beautiful woman in the mirror is you.\n Catching your breath in the doctor\u2019s office, you don\u2019t even mind the wait. It feels good just to sit still. Well, not still. Your foot keeps twitching, and you can\u2019t seem to make it stop. But why would you want to? It\u2019s good to keep moving. Helps burn those calories.\n They call your name and you walk into the examination room and sit down again. Your foot keeps up its hypnotic spasming, and everything looks like it\u2019s underwater. He comes out, the doctor does, and you lift up your shirt. He pinches you with cold metal on your stomach, your back, your thighs.\n \u201cAbigail, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, and you can see it in his eyes: the news is bad. \u201cYour body-fat index is point-oh-six.\u201d He looks like he wants to cry.\n You can\u2019t help yourself. You cry. You deserve to feel bad, tubby. Fatso. Whale. Blimp. Pig. Point-oh-six? How could you have been so weak? Too many calories, that\u2019s the problem. You stumble on your way out of the office, ignoring the secretary when she calls out your name. You decide then and there that something\u2019s going to have to give, and isn\u2019t going to be you. You cut you intake in half\u2014three hundred calories a day is more than enough. Decadent, even. You\u2019ve worked too hard for this to end now, for it to end like this, only\u2014\n Of course it\u2019s not enough. You\u2019re still not perfect. It doesn\u2019t matter how skinny you are if you\u2019re ugly. Thin and beautiful, that\u2019s the ticket. Only you chickened out at the end, before they were finished. One last procedure, that\u2019s all. One last procedure, and you\u2019ll finally know what it\u2019s like to be pretty.\n Dr. Bernstein handles the height augmentation\u2014he always does the best job, gets all the best dwarfs. Not that you\u2019re a midget. Or are they little people now?\n Over the course of six months, he breaks each leg three times in three different places. With the help of a special brace while they heal, he gives you another two and one-eighth inches of height. You grin and bear the pain, because it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s so worth it. It\u2019s gotta be worth it.\n It is worth it, for the pain pills he prescribes afterward if nothing else.\n One day in his office for a follow-up exam, you pick up last month\u2019s medical science journal and see an article about hip replacements. About strong, light, titanium alloys. It seems so obvious. Why hadn\u2019t you thought of it before?\n You dip into the trust fund (thankful your parents got that big life insurance policy just in time) and pull some strings, grease some wheels, sign some waivers. Three hundred thousand dollars and seven months later, 88% of your bones have been replaced by man-made parts, some lighter than the original by as much as half an ounce. The doctor even helps you pick out the supplements you need to purchase every month from the local GNC to stay healthy.\n \u201cVitamin D,\u201d he reiterates before you leave. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to get your vitamin D.\u201d\n You step on the scale and smile.\n You\u2019ve done it. For sure, this time. You jump up and down, squealing with delight, and clap your hands. They clank a little mechanically now, but the sound is actually quite musical, once you get used to it. Spots dance in front of your eyes. You begin to sweat. You shouldn\u2019t be exerting yourself so much, silly girl. Take a caffeine pill.\n Whew, that\u2019s better. Now . . . what were you doing?\n Oh yes. The celebration!\n You go to your favorite restaurant\u2014you sit at your favorite table\u2014and the waiter, the cute Spanish one who always flirts with you, smiles and brings you your regular order. You take a long moment and smell the delicious aroma of the non-fat artificial vanilla flavoring ice cream substitute, and it\u2019s heaven. You\u2019re in heaven. You know it\u2019s the wrong thing to do, you know that it\u2019s bad for you, but you can\u2019t help yourself: you put your spoon into the ice cream, and then inside your mouth!\n Oooohhh, everything is so cold and delicious! You let the ice cream substitute melt on your tongue, you let it run over your taste buds, you shiver in delight until\u2014\n Enough! You can\u2019t take it anymore! You run to the bathroom and rinse out your mouth with some of the bottled water in your purse. Can\u2019t be accidentally swallowing any, you naughty thing! In your haste to cleanse the badness, you spray water out all over the mirror.\n But what if you were too late? What if you already had swallowed some, just a little, so little that you hadn\u2019t even noticed? You go into the stall and shut the door behind you, and you\u2019re proud for a moment that you don\u2019t even need to use your fingers anymore.\n When you go to see the doctor the following day, you lift up your shirt and he pinches you with cold metal on your stomach, your back, your thighs.\n He frowns. \u201cThis can\u2019t be right,\u201d he says. He looks confused. He stares at you. He helps you stand up and takes you over to the scales. He fiddles with the weights for a few minutes, but no matter what he does it still says the same thing. You smile your secret little smile, the one you smile sometimes when your face is too tired for the other one, the one others can see, and you know that the instrument is correct. You know it, but it\u2019s just not official until a doctor says so. No\u2014the Doctor. Capital D. You can\u2019t wait to hear him say it. You can\u2019t wait to hear him say it, you can\u2019t wait to hear him say it. You can\u2019t wait. What the hell is he waiting for?\n \u201cAbigail,\u201d he says, finally giving up on the scale, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. How can you be six-two, weigh only fourteen pounds, and still be alive?\u201d\n You smile at him with the other smile, the external one, even though the effort threatens to prematurely wear you out. \u201cI know, doctor. I amaze even myself sometimes.\u201d\n You strut a little as you walk out of the office.\n Six weeks later, you meet the man of your dreams: a multibillionaire prince in exile, who makes his home in Connecticut now that the royal family of\u2014wherever, you were never good at geography\u2014has fallen out of favor. What makes him so special, though, is that you like him for who he is, and he likes you for who you are. It\u2019s not your body\u2014so perfect now, after all of your hard work\u2014or his money and his title. No, it\u2019s the little things that make the two of you work so well together, like how each of you can\u2019t help but smile when you see the other and how you never run out of things to talk about. You know, the important stuff.\n In fact, both of you were madly, wildly, truly in love (with the stars in your eyes and that warm glow in your hearts) well before it registered in your brains: it was the crotch-area that caught on first, you joke to all of your jealous friends.\n Someday, if they\u2019re lucky, maybe they can find a catch half as good. The poor plain things.\n Two months after you meet him, the day finally arrives. The day, the one you both worked so hard to obtain: your wedding day. You have on a simple white dress, no train, with very little lace work around the top. It accentuates your augmented bosom, and the rail-thin, rock-hard abdomen you sweated blood and tears and money to earn. The one extravagance in the simple ensemble is the veil\u2014so large, airy, and white it looks like a cloud-halo around your head. That\u2019s why you bought it. He always calls you his little angel.\n You step out of the limo on the big day and begin walking up the steps to the church. You take your time, resting every few steps and swallowing caffeine pills for energy when necessary. It\u2019s hard to do something so physical now that you\u2019ve perfected your body, but the thought of your prince waiting for you at the top gives your blood all the strength and vigor it needs\u2014until it happens.\n Damn the veil. It would never have happened without the veil. You\u2019re so thin, so perfect! There would have been no purchase for the wind. But you are wearing the veil, and you can\u2019t take it back now even though you scream as the gust of air slams into you from the side and lifts you up into the sky.\n The veil spreads out, all fifty thousand dollars of it, and it catches the wind almost as though it had been designed to do so from the very beginning, almost as though you really are an angel and the veil is your wings. You rise up into the air, higher and higher, and for a second your strained heart beats so fast that you are afraid it will burst. So you hold off on the caffeine pill you were about to swallow until it slows down again.\n Your prince sees it all happen from the chapel, and he races from the church to his car. His driver speeds off while he makes a call on his cell phone, and for two whole minutes you see nothing of him at all until\u2014it comes. The private helicopter. You smile when you see that your prince himself is there within it, right beside the pilot, shouting orders and gesturing wildly at you, his love. His princess. His angel.\n The chopper closes in, but it doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019re far too light now, and the veil is far too efficient at catching the wind. Whenever the helicopter rises up to meet you, the gusts created by its whirling blades do nothing but send you higher and higher into the atmosphere.\n Eventually the air is too thin for the helicopter to follow. You watch as it recedes, shrinking beneath you, becoming smaller and smaller\u2014a dot\u2014until finally, it is gone. The whole of planet Earth takes its place in stretching out beneath your feet, and you wave hello.\n I\u2019m queen of the world, you think. Smiling, you reach out with your arms and grab hold of the moon, pulling it to your bosom and snuggling close.\n You wish mom were alive to see you, but she isn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t, and in fact, no one ever sees you again. Not ever. But late at night, your many friends and the adoring public that fawned so jealously after your fairy tale wedding to the prince of\u2014wherever\u2014often look up into the sparkling sky. Up at your legend, to stare and silently wonder at which light above was added on that blustery, almost wedding day in March.\n All of them, you say in your secret voice. All of them.\n But they don\u2019t hear you. And every time you think of using your other voice, the one they could hear, it hardly seems worth the effort.\n Jeremiah Sturgill lives and writes in Fredericksburg, Virginia. \"Flight\" is his second published story. The first, \"Songbird,\" was published by Baen's Universe in late 2006. In 2005, he graduated from Mary Washington University and started Son and Foe, a fiction e-zine that crashed and burned a year later with spectacular predictability (but not before publishing a number of really great stories). In late 2007, he stopped talking at parties about this novel he planned on writing, and he began talking about this novel he'd finished. Sometime in the next twenty years, he hopes to actually sell the damn thing."}

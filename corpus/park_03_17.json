Some details don\u2019t match up but that\u2019s fine, everything else does; she remembers the little things, and they share those, even if the remembrance is sometimes painful. The quality of the illusion makes him feel better about his own scheduled imaging. He\u2019d avoided it all these years but now there\u2019s no more years to avoid it in, and so he\u2019d done all the things that he could remember to do\u2014reconnect with surviving members of the Hong family, talk to old friends, finish getting his will set up. Doing them had kept his mind busy, had kept him pushing through. Now as he talks to Maureen he feels like things are about to get better, but that\u2019s when the doorbell rings.\n A quick glance to a view outside confirms his suspicions: it\u2019s Maurice, his still-alive brother. He\u2019s tempted to leave the door shut but Maureen\u2019s disapproving look is enough to let the other in, who struts in with a big grin on his face.\n \u201cHey,\u201d says Maurice.\n \u201cHey,\u201d says Maury. And nothing after.\n The smile on Maurice\u2019s face droops and disappears as silence grows. Maureen clears her throat but it\u2019s not enough\u2014what\u2019s there to even talk about? Eventually, Maurice retreats to an adjacent room, and Maury is too tired to object. It\u2019d be better if he\u2019d just left, but that\u2019ll do for now.\n Maury queues up Maureen to talk to her again, but in the middle of doing so he catches a stray bit of conversation, from that same room Maurice had gone to, and he listens and yes, it\u2019s Maureen\u2014and then Maureen comes up and it\u2019s like she\u2019s right there, but it\u2019s not quite right; it\u2019s not his Maureen; and now Maureen\u2019s lack of debilitation and the sight he\u2019d beheld at her funeral of her head all waxen and pale, it all comes rushing back and the illusion, it\u2019s done\u2014he can\u2019t face her anymore, at least not at the moment. She\u2019s not real, for a real person cannot exist in two places at once talking to two people at the same time. There she is, in his room, and in the other is Maurice talking to another version of Maureen, and Maury asks her to leave and she goes and he eavesdrops as his siblings, one dead and one alive, one fake and the other still real, talk and talk about things that don\u2019t involve him.\n His imaging is to take place on Friday. The instructions were short. Think about your best memories, it had said. Hold onto them as your waveform is scanned. And anyone signed into consent, they could bring him up at any time, take solace in his company even after his demise, have conversations and whatnot. Thinking of it, the old insecurities creep up, extant fears that no one will summon his holo.\n Some of that fear is assuaged when more of the family visit on Wednesday. He suspects that Maureen has something to do with this, sensing his anxieties, but then it doesn\u2019t seem plausible given that\u2014as he must remind himself\u2014she\u2019s not real, and likely has no autonomous thought, so how could she have? The only logical conclusion is that these family members have come on their own, and the thought, though he doubts sometimes, is very cheering. The children are loud, but he doesn\u2019t mind; still, when the adults notice their volume they send the kids away with an accompaniment of holos, and Maury recognizes a few of them, Jinsoo, his grandmother, his uncle, his father, and his mother and more\u2014a retinue of past Hongs who shepherd their descendants even after death.\n \u201cThey\u2019re the best, aren\u2019t they?\u201d The speaker is a young man whose name Maury cannot recall.\n \u201cI suppose so,\u201d he says, feeling nothing of the sort.\n \u201cJust want to let you know\u2014we\u2019ll be sure to queue you up as much as possible. We\u2019ve talked about it; you\u2019re a real role model, the sort of a person our kids can look up to. A man of conviction.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n \u201cAnyway, Nicola did get the consent stuff taken care, I think, so no worries there.\u201d\n He says: \u201cYeah, for sure. No worries there.\u201d\n But yes, there are others besides Maureen; any member of the family that was able to get a holo of themselves done before death\u2014so thirty years back at most\u2014and he calls them up one by one. There\u2019s his grandmother. She\u2019d passed away just after the prototypes had gone up; Maurice, the rich one, had commissioned it for her on her deathbed. There she is\u2014when she first appears she\u2019s way younger than what he remembers of her, always white-haired and cronish, but here a middle-aged Korean woman, an ajumma through and through. The conversation they have is odd in how effortless it is\u2014the language barrier had been very real back then, back when he\u2019d been a kid and she\u2019d still been around, and how fair is it that not only is Maurice the rich one, but also the oldest one, yet still the healthy one? Still, it\u2019s nice to talk to what he remembers of his grandmother without all the gesticulating and the muddled waters of a conversation where sentences don\u2019t begin and end in the same language.\n It\u2019s not flawless, of course. Her imaging is from so long ago that there\u2019s a noticeable hitch if you shift the topic too fast, maybe jut from futbol to football or from breakfast to what he had for dinner.\n Once he grows tired of her, he dismisses her and goes through the rest of the collection. Flipping through a list of undesirables, he\u2019s reminded of how there had always been a divide between the Korean-American and Korean-Korean branches of the family, a benign one but present nonetheless. But it had never been like that with him and Jinsoo, and upon calling him up Maury can\u2019t help but smile at the sight. Seeing an old friend basically, the friendship having ended long before it could sour, though this time the youth is no lie, it was how he\u2019d been when he\u2019d died, what he\u2019d looked like in his 20\u2019s because he\u2019d never lasted beyond that\u2014and this Jinsoo, this fake ghost of the man, he asks Maury if he wants to play another round of baduk. It\u2019s amusing; he\u2019d never done this with the actual Jinsoo. The difference\u2014where what\u2019s in front of him is obviously not the real thing\u2014reassures him.\n They play a little. Maury has black, Jinsoo has white. Maury is terrible, and he loses three games before calling it off. When Jinsoo disappears, he dims the room and for a while sits there mulling over old memories.\n After a few minutes he calls up Maureen. They talk a little and conversation strays to a time when the siblings\u2014all three of them\u2014had gone looking for their cat, Spring; as they remember how they\u2019d walked along the wall of some house and the resident there had sicced her poodles on them, and they\u2019d hopped off laughing, she says, \u201cI wish Maurice was here,\u201d and he agrees despite feeling nothing of the sort. He\u2019d never been one to disagree with her; the yes always came unbidden, a habit.\n That\u2019s when Maurice asks if he could come in. It\u2019s rather odd. He\u2019d been the sort of person who never knocked, and as a result his siblings had developed a habit of locking everything in their rooms. But now Maurice has asked, quietly, if he could enter. So Maury says, \u201cCome in.\u201d\n Maurice enters. Again the picture of health. Damn him. \u201cYou feeling okay?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s been good.\u201d\n \u201cJust wanted to check up on you, bro.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re doing that, yes.\u201d\n Maurice takes a seat by the window, all closed and curtained off. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI know we haven\u2019t been the best of friends, or brothers, or family in the past, but now that it\u2019s come to this\u2014\u201d\n \u201cAll it takes is two deaths in the family, huh?\u201d\n \u201cOne,\u201d says Maurice. \u201cYou\u2019re not dead.\u201d\n \u201cYet.\u201d\n \u201cYet. Which means we can make up a little. Be better friends, brothers. Right?\u201d\n \u201cI know your game.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d\n \u201cI was there too, you know. Not that you ever talked to me or Maureen. It was that huge mess of a Thanksgiving, when Auntie brought out Uncle, and what a fucking mess that was.\u201d\n Maurice starts giggling and Maury cannot help but join in. No more words are needed. What a fucking mess it had been\u2014the worst and best sort of mess\u2014Uncle had come out, recently deceased but there nonetheless, a real ghost of a man, and everyone had clapped\u2014he\u2019s back, he\u2019s back!\u2014but Uncle had left on bad terms, apparently, because he\u2019d proceeded to tear into everyone present, including his surviving wife, his wife\u2019s family, his own brothers and sisters and extant families of each, and politicians, athletes, even the guy who ran the pool bets on Friday\u2014Auntie had ran off to try to turn him off, because for some reason she was unable to do it from the dining room\u2014and the survivors had watched Uncle wail and wail, all out of insults, bugging out as he screamed. Horribly awkward.\n \u201cSo what do you think my endgame is, brother?\u201d\n \u201cI think that\u2014when I die\u2014you want to be able to call up my holo and not have something like that happen.\u201d\n \u201cIf I was worried, wouldn\u2019t I just avoid calling you up in the future?\u201d\n \u201cYou want to show me to your kids,\u201d says Maury. \u201cParade me around to the children I never got to meet. You want both my consent, and also my good will.\u201d\n \u201cOh, them. Well, yes. I\u2019m sorry about that. But now they\u2019re a little too old for this, so don\u2019t you worry about that. Off to live lives of their own and whatnot.\u201d\n \u201cSo what then, grandkids? Great-grandkids?\u201d\n Maurice looks uncomfortable. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d\n \u201cAnd now I suppose this is where I forgive you.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t have to, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n \u201cJust go.\u201d\n \u201cCan I come back?\u201d\n Maury looks up at his brother and his brother looks so serious about this that he agrees to it.\n But even after Maurice leaves, he can\u2019t help but dwell on something odd. His uncle, the memory he\u2019d shared with his brother of that man\u2019s ghost being an absolute shitheel\u2014it was so different from how sedate he\u2019d been when seen in the company of other holos earlier.\n Only three days are left until his imaging. He may have a few weeks after that to enjoy life. Maury has no idea how he might go about doing that, and so Maurice tosses suggestions at him\u2014go surfing maybe.\n \u201cI\u2019m scared of water.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about a marathon? There\u2019s one in Colorado Springs soon.\u201d\n \u201cHave you seen my legs?\u201d\n \u201cWe could go eat.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t digest anything anymore, dear brother.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n \u201cYou should be. You\u2019d know this if you cared before this, before now.\u201d\n \u201cHey,\u201d says Maurice, \u201cmaybe it\u2019d be easier if you stopped guilt-tripping me all the time.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe you deserve it.\u201d\n \u201cI probably do.\u201d\n \u201cThen why complain?\u201d\n \u201cBecause it\u2019s still fucking annoying.\u201d\n \u201cGive me a break,\u201d says Maury. \u201cI\u2019m dying! When I\u2019m gone, I will never be a dick to you. I\u2019ll be all smiles and kisses and you\u2019ll tell your grandchildren that you had the best of all possible brothers and you\u2019ll have my holo beside you nodding along like I really agreed.\u201d\n \u201cI guess that means I have your consent, then?\u201d\n \u201cYes. No. Maybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cYou can be a dick, brother. Like, feel free to just be real, right? Honest. I\u2019d rather see that then have you be all fake and smiling just so I could show them to my children and their children.\u201d\n Maury opens his mouth. He wants to say something, but that something, though its general idea has already been conceived, lacks specifics. He closes his mouth. Opens them again. Something about what Maurice has said gets to him. Maybe it\u2019s that these are the longest conversations they\u2019ve had in years, but that by itself doesn\u2019t feel quite right.\n Two days left and he spends most of the day drugged out; the pain has gotten to him and so he weaves in and out of consciousness and it feels as if Maurice and Maureen are both always there, and they are indistinguishable, and he thinks, in those spots of lucidity, technology, what an amazing fucking thing it is.\n Maurice, Maureen, and Maury. The Hong siblings. One of them is already gone. And the other, fucking Maurice, is definitely a holo. He tests this out. He calls for Maurice. Maurice appears.\n \u201cCome closer,\u201d he says.\n So Maurice does.\n \u201cCloser.\u201d\n A little closer.\n Still not within range to touch\u2014to feel\u2014and Maury thinks about how he\u2019d had to invite him in always, and that was never Maurice\u2019s deal, he liked having the freedom to barge into his siblings\u2019 rooms, and when Maury had put a lock on his door the lock had gotten filed off a day later\u2014and Maury heaves himself up and swipes at Maurice and his hand passes through everything and nothing and he yells, \u201cMaurice!\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d says the holo, \u201clet me help you, bro.\u201d\n \u201cFuck you,\u201d says Maury. \u201cBut you know what, sure. Help me. Help all you can.\u201d Is this where he laughs? He tries it out. It feels bad, so he stops.\n \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m very okay. For now. Tell me\u2014Maurice is nothing like this in life, is he?\u201d\n The holo-brother looks distinctly uncomfortable. \u201cI can\u2019t confirm that.\u201d\n \u201cI bet he\u2019s a jerk still. A real asshole. Maybe it\u2019s better that you\u2019re here still.\u201d The last part just pops out of his mouth and yet he doesn\u2019t regret it, because what\u2019s there to regret? Who is there to offend\u2014the simulacrum?\n Maurice and Maureen were the intentional ones. Then he\u2019d come along, and they\u2019d named him appropriately, the third in the Mau-line of Hongs. If only they could have been, perhaps, Joshua, Joan, Jonas? Good names that could begin with Jo as their lead syllable instead of Mau. But at least Maurice and Maureen sounded natural. Stuffy, admittedly. But still, more natural than Maury.\n He calls for Maureen. He asks if she\u2019d known about Maurice.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I thought it\u2019d be better if you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t know,\u201d says Maury. \u201cBut you remember what Maurice was like. Or rather, is like. I can\u2019t imagine being his kid. Being his kid must be the worst thing in the world. Can you imagine it? Think about our parents getting our grades in email, and how horrible that felt. Now imagine being his kid right now. The guy couldn\u2019t even stand the thought of not being able to come into our rooms whenever he wanted, and now he\u2019s not a child anymore and this is his child. His kid probably has zero privacy. His kid, I bet Maurice is there following on some widget, a fly maybe, just watching and watching every move.\u201d\n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hate him. He is what he is.\u201d\n \u201cHe sent his holo! Not even himself. Fuck him. I can\u2019t believe I ever called him a brother. A sibling. Family.\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re like this when you get imaged, your holo is going to be mean and no one will see you.\u201d\n \u201cFuck him. He couldn\u2019t even come see me in person.\u201d He feels so sorry for himself and he hates it, that he\u2019s pitying himself like this to the point where he\u2019s having to blink a little too much, and when he wipes away at the corners of his eyes his fingers come away smeared with rheum.\n \u201cLet\u2019s talk about something better,\u201d says Maureen. \u201cRemember that trip to Carlsbad?\u201d\n \u201cIt was so dark there. We sat there waiting for the dark outside too. For the bats. Or maybe it was another cave. Caves, all of them are the same. You go inside and they turn the light off a little bit and suddenly it\u2019s pitch-black and dark and you\u2019re supposed to feel something, and I do, Maureen, because isn\u2019t that where I\u2019m going?\u201d\n \u201cA better memory. Your birthday party!\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d he says, \u201cyes, that was a good time. We had cake and mom made LA galbi and japchae and remember how we didn\u2019t have enough candles? So you ran down to the store for me, the dollar place, and you got a pack of candles and you also had a pack of army men as my present. Thank you, Maureen.\u201d\n She beams. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Do you feel better now?\u201d\n \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cNow please go.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know, you look like you need\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou make me feel like a goddamn baby and you\u2019re not even real. Please go, Maureen.\u201d\n She sighs. \u201cOkay. But I\u2019m here for you, alright? Just call for me. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d\n \u201cWait,\u201d he says.\n \u201cI\u2019m here for you, like I said.\u201d\n \u201cJust one question. The guidelines said I should think happy thoughts.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you should.\u201d\n \u201cBut does any of that matter?\u201d\n \u201cIt has to,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy would they mention it otherwise?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe it\u2019s to make me make myself feel better for no reason at all.\u201d\n \u201cBut isn\u2019t it a good thing to make yourself feel better?\u201d\n \u201cOf course. Then I\u2019d be feeling better. Jesus Christ. How fucking simple.\u201d He tries to think of an appropriate physical reaction\u2014a shrug perhaps\u2014but nothing really fits and so he simply sighs. \u201cDid you make yourself remember only the good parts when you got imaged? The last imaging, I mean. When you knew there probably wouldn\u2019t be more.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s appropriate to tell you, not in your current state.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d\n \u201cBut remember\u2014I\u2019m here for you.\u201d\n And in the end, they\u2019re there, his sister and his brother. Off he goes to the Maestas Spectrum Facility. There in the lobby, he wheels right through a pack of holos and Maureen is horrified.\n \u201cWhat if they were real?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re too healthy to be real,\u201d he says. \u201cJust look at them. Glowing, practically.\u201d\n \u201cI got my imaging done every three years, and for most of those I was super healthy.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d He pauses, looks back. \u201cI didn\u2019t run anyone over, did I? I didn\u2019t feel a thing. No bumps, nothing.\u201d\n \u201cIf you did, you\u2019d hear the screaming already,\u201d says Maurice.\n \u201cAnd the ding-ding-ding of incoming lawsuits.\u201d\n \u201cYou two are awful,\u201d says Maureen, smiling.\n And Maury thinks about how awful Maureen could be, when she wanted\u2014and how perfect she\u2019d been for the last few days. The ghosts, they\u2019re better people, better than any real ghost, and what would he be like once the only thing that remained of him was the holo, the not-Maury? Chatting with Maurice\u2019s grandchildren and shit, probably. The thought is oddly pleasing and he wonders that it is so.\n They wait for their turn. In front of them is a woman with a little girl. Both real, because the woman is carrying the girl in her arms. The girl looks like she\u2019s two, maybe less.\n Maury asks: \u201cCouldn\u2019t find a babysitter?\u201d It happens sometimes, no doubt. Maybe the parent doesn\u2019t trust non-human caretakers.\n \u201cOh no,\u201d she says, flashing him a smile that quickly turns to pity once she sees the state he\u2019s in. \u201cIt\u2019s for her.\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s, well, neat.\u201d\n \u201cI mean, okay, it\u2019s not normal, but you never know, right?\u201d\n \u201cAnything could happen,\u201d he agrees. \u201cAnything.\u201d\n \u201cRight. And if something happens, well\u2014\u201d she blinks a few times and Maury feels terrible. Why did he have to be such an asshole?\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n \u201cNo no, it\u2019s fine. But yes, if something did happen, well, there would be a little something of her.\u201d\n What would a holo of a baby would be like? Would they be babies forever? Or aged up? When summoned, would they, what, crawl in on all fours or waddle on their twos, or come as a young child, or a teen, or maybe even an adult? Whatever you want them to be, they will be.\n What the hell, he has nothing to lose. So he asks.\n \u201cNo,\u201d she says, looking uncomfortable. \u201cShe\u2019ll stay a baby. Assuming she\u2019s a baby if that happens.\u201d\n \u201cBut you could watch them grow\u2014\u201d\n She glances at Maureen then Maurice and both of them shrug a little, and the tone conveyed is apologetic and Maury observes this all with a detached, somewhat cruel feeling. As if on queue her number is called, and without a word she hurries away.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a real jerk, you know that?\u201d\n \u201cShut up, Maurice.\u201d\n \u201cBe nice,\u201d says Maureen.\n It\u2019s in front of a tall plastic-gray gate that they stop. There\u2019s a sign\u2014no holos allowed past. No distractions permitted where the real work is done.\n \u201cMaurice,\u201d says Maury, \u201ctell your master\u2014or yourself\u2014or whatever the terminology is that he has my consent to be summoned, called up, whatever it is that people do. I just can\u2019t guarantee that whatever he calls up will be particularly happy with him. In fact I\u2019d like to be particularly nasty to him if possible, but I get the feeling that it\u2019ll be out of my control, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the best, man.\u201d\n \u201cMaureen, you\u2019re not even real but I\u2019m glad I got to talk to you again for a while.\u201d\n \u201cIt was nothing,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like you\u2019re going in there to die, right? You\u2019ll be right back out. It takes like ten minutes, tops.\u201d\n She\u2019s right. It is silly to be so solemn about this. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. Maurice: disregard everything I just said to you.\u201d\n \u201cOh, come on\u2014\u201d\n Off he goes. When he crosses the gate there\u2019s a dim change in tone, something about the lighting separating the bright warmth outside and the colder, clinical feel within. And they are both gone. He\u2019s never been lonelier."}

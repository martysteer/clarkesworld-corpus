The people who lived there were called Whirlikins, who were tall thin people with pointed heads. They had long arms and made frantic gestures when they talked, and when they grew excited threw their arms out wide to either side and spun like tops until they got all blurry. They would whirr madly over the green grass beneath the pumpkin-orange sky of the Whirlikin country, and sometimes they would bump into each other with an alarming clashing noise, but they were never hurt, only bounced off and spun away in another direction.\nSometimes one of them would spin so hard that he would dig himself right into the ground, and come to a sudden stop, buried to the shoulders, with an expression of alarmed dismay.\nJamie had never seen anything so funny. He laughed and laughed.\nHis little sister Becky laughed, too. Once she laughed so hard that she fell over onto her stomach, and Daddy picked her up and whirled her through the air, as if he were a Whirlikin himself, and they were both laughing all the while.\nAfterwards, they heard the dinner bell, and Daddy said it was time to go home. After they waved goodbye to the Whirlikins, Becky and Jamie walked hand-in-hand with Momma as they walked over the grassy hills toward home, and the pumpkin-orange sky slowly turned to blue.\nThe way home ran past El Castillo. El Castillo looked like a fabulous place, a castle with towers and domes and minarets, all gleaming in the sun. Music floated down from El Castillo, the swift, intricate music of many guitars, and Jamie could hear the fast click of heels and the shouts and laughter of happy people.\nBut Jamie did not try to enter El Castillo. He had tried before, and discovered that El Castillo was guarded by La Duchesa, an angular forbidding woman all in black, with a tall comb in her hair. When Jamie asked to come inside, La Duchesa had looked down at him and said, \u201cI do not admit anyone who does not know Spanish irregular verbs!\u201d It was all she ever said.\nJamie had asked Daddy what a Spanish irregular verb was\u2014he had difficulty pronouncing the words\u2014and Daddy had said, \u201cSome day you\u2019ll learn, and La Duchesa will let you into her castle. But right now you\u2019re too young to learn Spanish.\u201d\nThat was all right with Jamie. There were plenty of things to do without going into El Castillo. And new places, like the country where the Whirlikins lived, appeared sometimes out of nowhere, and were quite enough to explore.\nThe color of the sky faded from orange to blue. Fluffy white clouds coasted in the air above the two-story frame house. Mister Jeepers, who was sitting on the ridgepole, gave a cry of delight and soared toward them through the air.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s home!\u201d he sang happily. \u201cJamie\u2019s home, and he\u2019s brought his beautiful sister!\u201d\nMister Jeepers was diamond-shaped, like a kite, with his head at the topmost corner, hands on either sides, and little bowlegged comical legs attached on the bottom. He was bright red. Like a kite, he could fly, and he swooped through in a series of aerial cartwheels as he sailed toward Jamie and his party.\nBecky looked up at Mister Jeepers and laughed from pure joy. \u201cJamie,\u201d she said, \u201cyou live in the best place in the world!\u201d\nAt night, when Jamie lay in bed with his stuffed giraffe, Selena would ride a beam of pale light from the Moon to the Earth and sit by Jamie\u2019s side. She was a pale woman, slightly translucent, with a silver crescent on her brow. She would stroke Jamie\u2019s forehead with a cool hand, and she would sing to him until his eyes grew heavy and slumber stole upon him.\n\u201cThe birds have tucked their heads\nThe night is dark and deep\nAll is quiet, all is safe,\nAnd little Jamie goes to sleep.\u201d\nWhenever Jamie woke during the night, Selena was there to comfort him. He was glad that Selena always watched out for him, because sometimes he still had nightmares about being in the hospital. When the nightmares came, she was always there to soothe him, stroke him, sing him back to sleep.\nBefore long the nightmares began to fade.\nPrincess Gigunda always took Jamie for lessons. She was a huge woman, taller than Daddy, with frowzy hair and big bare feet and a crown that could never be made to sit straight on her head. She was homely, with a mournful face that was ugly and endearing at the same time. As she shuffled along with Jamie to his lessons, Princess Gigunda complained about the way her feet hurt, and about how she was a giant and unattractive, and how she would never be married.\n\u201cI\u2019ll marry you when I get bigger,\u201d Jamie said loyally, and the Princess\u2019 homely face screwed up into an expression of beaming pleasure.\nJamie had different lessons with different people. Mrs. Winkle, down at the little red brick schoolhouse, taught him his ABCs. Coach Toad\u2014who was one\u2014taught him field games, where he raced and jumped and threw against various people and animals. Mr. McGillicuddy, a pleasant whiskered fat man who wore red sleepers with a trapdoor in back, showed him his magic globe. When Jamie put his finger anywhere on the globe, trumpets began to sound, and he could see what was happening where he was pointing, and Mr. McGillicuddy would take him on a tour and show him interesting things. Buildings, statues, pictures, parks, people. \u201cThis is Nome,\u201d he would say. \u201cCan you say Nome?\u201d\n\u201cNome,\u201d Jamie would repeat, shaping his mouth around the unfamiliar word, and Mr. McGillicuddy would smile and bob his head and look pleased.\nIf Jamie did well on his lessons, he got extra time with the Whirlikins, or at the Zoo, or with Mr. Fuzzy, or in Pandaland. Until the dinner bell rang, and it was time to go home.\nJamie did well with his lessons almost every day.\nWhen Princess Gigunda took him home from his lessons, Mister Jeepers would fly from the ridgepole to meet him, and tell him that his family was ready to see him. And then Momma and Daddy and Becky would wave from the windows of the house, and he would run to meet them.\nOnce, when he was in the living room telling his family about his latest trip through Mr. McGillicuddy\u2019s magic globe, he began skipping about with enthusiasm, and waving his arms like a Whirlikin, and suddenly he noticed that no one else was paying attention. That Momma and Daddy and Becky were staring at something else, their faces frozen in different attitudes of polite attention.\nJamie felt a chill finger touch his neck.\n\u201cMomma?\u201d Jamie said. \u201cDaddy?\u201d Momma and Daddy did not respond. Their faces didn\u2019t move. Daddy\u2019s face was blurred strangely, as if it been caught in the middle of movement.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d Jamie came close and tried to tug at his father\u2019s shirt sleeve. It was hard, like marble, and his fingers couldn\u2019t get a purchase at it. Terror blew hot in his heart.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d Jamie cried. He tried to tug harder. \u201cDaddy! Wake up!\u201d Daddy didn\u2019t respond. He ran to Momma and tugged at her hand. \u201cMomma! Momma!\u201d Her hand was like the hand of a statue. She didn\u2019t move no matter how hard Jamie pulled.\n\u201cHelp!\u201d Jamie screamed. \u201cMister Jeepers! Mr. Fuzzy! Help my Momma!\u201d Tears fell down his face as he ran from Becky to Momma to Daddy, tugging and pulling at them, wrapping his arms around their frozen legs and trying to pull them toward him. He ran outside, but everything was curiously still. No wind blew. Mister Jeepers sat on the ridgepole, a broad smile fixed as usual to his face, but he was frozen, too, and did not respond to Jamie\u2019s calls.\nTerror pursued him back into the house. This was far worse than anything that had happened to him in the hospital, worse even than the pain. Jamie ran into the living room, where his family stood still as statues, and then recoiled in horror. A stranger had entered the room\u2014or rather just parts of a stranger, a pair of hands encased in black gloves with strange silver circuit patterns on the backs, and a strange glowing opalescent face with a pair of wraparound dark glasses drawn across it like a line.\n\u201cInterface crashed, all right,\u201d the stranger said, as if to someone Jamie couldn\u2019t see.\nJamie gave a scream. He ran behind Momma\u2019s legs for protection.\n\u201cOh shit,\u201d the stranger said. \u201cThe kid\u2019s still running.\u201d\nHe began purposefully moving his hands as if poking at the air. Jamie was sure that it was some kind of terrible attack, a spell to turn him to stone. He tried to run away, tripped over Becky\u2019s immovable feet and hit the floor hard, and then crawled away, the hall rug bunching up under his hands and knees as he skidded away, his own screams ringing in his ears . . .\nHe sat up in bed, shrieking. The cool night tingled on his skin. He felt Selena\u2019s hand on his forehead, and he jerked away with a cry.\n\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d came Selena\u2019s calm voice. \u201cDid you have a bad dream?\u201d Under the glowing crescent on her brow, Jamie could see the concern in her eyes.\n\u201cWhere are Momma and Daddy?\u201d Jamie wailed.\n\u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d Selena said. \u201cThey\u2019re asleep in their room. Was it a bad dream?\u201d\nJamie threw off the covers and leaped out of bed. He ran down the hall, the floorboards cool on his bare feet. Selena floated after him in her serene, concerned way. He threw open the door to his parents\u2019 bedroom and snapped on the light, then gave a cry as he saw them huddled beneath their blanket. He flung himself at his mother, and gave a sob of relief as she opened her eyes and turned to him.\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Momma said. \u201cWas it a bad dream?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie wailed. He tried to explain, but even he knew that his words made no sense. Daddy rose from his pillow, looking seriously at Jamie, and then turned to ruffle his hair.\n\u201cSounds like a pretty bad dream, trouper,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to bed.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie buried his face in his mother\u2019s neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back to bed!\u201d\n\u201cAll right, Jamie,\u201d Momma said. She patted Jamie\u2019s back. \u201cYou can sleep here with us. But just for tonight, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWanna stay here,\u201d Jamie mumbled. He crawled under the covers between Momma and Daddy. They each kissed him, and Daddy turned off the light. \u201cJust go to sleep, trouper,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll only have good dreams from now on.\u201d\nSelena, faintly glowing in the darkness, sat silently in the corner. \u201cShall I sing?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes, Selena,\u201d Daddy said. \u201cPlease sing for us.\u201d\nSelena began to sing,\nThe birds have tucked their heads,\nThe night is dark and deep\nAll is quiet, all is safe,\nAnd little Jamie goes to sleep.\nBut Jamie did not sleep. Despite the singing, the dark night, the rhythmic breathing of his parents and the comforting warmth of their bodies.\nIt wasn\u2019t a dream, he knew. His family had really been frozen. Something, or someone, had turned them to stone. Probably that evil disembodied head and pair of hands. And now, for some reason, his parents didn\u2019t remember.\nSomething had made them forget.\nJamie stared into the darkness. What, he thought, if these weren\u2019t his parents? If his parents were still stone, hidden away somewhere? What if these substitutes were bad people\u2014kidnappers or worse\u2014people who just looked like his real parents? What if they were evil people who were just waiting for him to fall asleep, and then they would turn to monsters, with teeth and fangs and a horrible light in their eyes, and they would tear him to bits right here in the bed . . .\nTalons of panic clawed at Jamie\u2019s heart. Selena\u2019s song echoed in his ears. He wasn\u2019t going to sleep! He wasn\u2019t!\nAnd then he did. It wasn\u2019t anything like normal sleep\u2014it was as if sleep was imposed on him, as if something had just ordered his mind to sleep. It was just like a wave that rolled over him, an irresistible force, blotting out his senses, his body, his mind . . .\nI won\u2019t sleep! he thought in defiance, but then his thoughts were extinguished.\nWhen he woke he was back in his own bed, and it was morning, and Mister Jeepers was floating outside the window. \u201cJamie\u2019s awake!\u201d he sang. \u201cJamie\u2019s awake and ready for a new day!\u201d\nAnd then his parents came bustling in, kissing him and petting him and taking him downstairs for breakfast.\nHis fears seemed foolish now, in full daylight, with Mister Jeepers dancing in the air outside and singing happily.\nBut sometimes, at night while Selena crooned by his bedside, he gazed into the darkness and felt a thrill of fear.\nAnd he never forgot, not entirely.\nA few days later Don Quixote wandered into the world, a lean man who frequently fell off his lean horse in a clang of homemade armor. He was given to making wan comments in both English and his own language, which turned out to be Spanish.\n\u201cCan you teach me Spanish irregular verbs?\u201d Jamie asked.\n\u201cS\u00ed, naturalmente,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cBut I will have to teach you some other Spanish as well.\u201d He looked particularly mournful. \u201cLet\u2019s start with coraz\u00f3n. It means \u2018heart.\u2019 Mi coraz\u00f3n,\u201d he said with a sigh, \u201cis breaking for love of Dulcinea.\u201d\nAfter a few sessions with Don Quixote\u2014mixed with a lot of sighing about coraz\u00f3ns and Dulcinea\u2014Jamie took a grip on his courage, marched up to El Castillo, and spoke to La Duchesa.\n\u201cPierdo, sue\u00f1o, har\u00eda, ponto!\u201d he cried.\nLa Duchesa\u2019s eyes widened in surprise, and as she bent toward Jamie her severe face became almost kindly. \u201cYou are obviously a very intelligent boy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou may enter my castle.\u201d\nAnd so Don Quixote and La Duchesa, between the two of them, began to teach Jamie to speak Spanish. If he did well, he was allowed into the parts of the castle where the musicians played and the dancers stamped, where brave Castilian knights jousted in the tilting yard, and Se\u00f1or Esteban told stories in Spanish, always careful to use words that Jamie already knew.\nJamie couldn\u2019t help but notice that sometimes Don Quixote behaved strangely. Once, when Jamie was visiting the Whirlikins, Don Quixote charged up on his horse, waving his sword and crying out that he would save Jamie from the goblins that were attacking him. Before Jamie could explain that the Whirlikins were harmless, Don Quixote galloped to the attack. The Whirlikins, alarmed, screwed themselves into the ground where they were safe, and Don Quixote fell off his horse trying to swing at one with his sword. After poor Quixote fell off his horse a few times, it was Jamie who had to rescue the Don, not the other way around.\nIt was sort of sad and sort of funny. Every time Jamie started to laugh about it, he saw Don Quixote\u2019s mournful face in his mind, and his laugh grew uneasy.\nAfter a while, Jamie\u2019s sister Becky began to share Jamie\u2019s lessons. She joined him and Princess Gigunda on the trip to the little schoolhouse, learned reading and math from Mrs. Winkle, and then, after some coaching from Jamie and Don Quixote, she marched to La Duchesa to shout irregular verbs and gain entrance to the El Castillo.\nAround that time Marcus Tullius Cicero turned up to take them both to the Forum Romanum, a new part of the world that had appeared to the south of the Whirlikins\u2019 territory. But Cicero and the people in the Forum, all the shopkeepers and politicians, did not teach Latin the way Don Quixote taught Spanish, explaining what the new words meant in English, they just talked Latin at each other and expected Jamie and Becky to understand. Which, eventually, they did. The Spanish helped. Jamie was a bit better at Latin than Becky, but he explained to her that it was because he was older.\nIt was Becky who became interested in solving Princess Gigunda\u2019s problem. \u201cWe should find her somebody to love,\u201d she said.\n\u201cShe loves us,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d Becky said. \u201cShe wants a boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m her boyfriend,\u201d Jamie insisted.\nBecky looked a little impatient. \u201cBesides,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s a puzzle. Just like La Duchesa and her verbs.\u201d\nThis had not occurred to Jamie before, but now that Becky mentioned it, the idea seemed obvious. There were a lot of puzzles around, which one or the other of them was always solving, and Princess Gigunda\u2019s lovelessness was, now that he saw it, clearly among them.\nSo they set out to find Princess Gigunda a mate. This question occupied them for several days, and several candidates were discussed and rejected. They found no answers until they went to the chariot race at the Circus Maximus. It was the first race in the Circus ever, because the place had just appeared on the other side of the Palatine Hill from the Forum, and there was a very large, very excited crowd.\nThe names of the charioteers were announced as they paraded their chariots to the starting line. The trumpets sounded, and the chariots bolted from the star as the drivers whipped up the horses. Jamie watched enthralled as they rolled around the spina for the first lap, and then shouted in surprise at the sight of Don Quixote galloping onto the Circus Maximus, shouting that he was about to stop this group of rampaging demons from destroying the land, and planted himself directly in the path of the oncoming chariots. Jamie shouted along with the crowd for the Don to get out of the way before he got killed.\nFortunately Quixote\u2019s horse had more sense than he did, because the spindly animal saw the chariots coming and bolted, throwing its rider. One of the chariots rode right over poor Quixote, and there was a horrible clanging noise, but after the chariot passed, Quixote sat up, apparently unharmed. His armor had saved him.\nJamie jumped from his seat and was about to run down to help Don Quixote off the course, but Becky grabbed his arm. \u201cHang on,\u201d she said, \u201cSomeone else will look after him, and I have an idea.\u201d\nShe explained that Don Quixote would make a perfect man for Princess Gigunda.\n\u201cBut he\u2019s in love with Dulcinea!\u201d\nBecky looked at him patiently. \u201cHas anyone ever seen Dulcinea? All we have to do is convince Don Quixote that Princess Gigunda is Dulcinea.\u201d\nAfter the races, they found that Don Quixote had been arrested by the lictors and sent to the Lautumiae, which was the Roman jail. They weren\u2019t allowed to see the prisoner, so they went in search of Cicero, who was a lawyer and was able to get Quixote out of the Lautumiae on the promise that he would never visit Rome again.\n\u201cI regret to the depths of my soul that my parole does not enable me to destroy those demons,\u201d Quixote said as he left Rome\u2019s town limits.\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get into that,\u201d Becky said. \u201cWhat we wanted to tell you was that we\u2019ve found Dulcinea.\u201d\nThe old man\u2019s eyes widened in joy. He clutched at his armor-clad heart. \u201cMi amor! Where is she? I must run to her at once!\u201d\n\u201cNot just yet,\u201d Becky said. \u201cYou should know that she\u2019s been changed. She doesn\u2019t look like she used to.\u201d\n\u201cHas some evil sorcerer done this?\u201d Quixote demanded.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Jamie interrupted. He was annoyed that Becky had taken charge of everything, and he wanted to add his contribution to the scheme. \u201cThe sorcerer was just a head!\u201d he shouted. \u201cA floating head, and a pair of hands! And he wore dark glasses and had no body!\u201d\nA shiver of fear passed through him as he remembered the eerie floating head, but the memory of his old terror did not stop his words from spilling out.\nBecky gave him a strange look. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cHe crashed the interface!\u201d Jamie shouted, the words coming to him out of memory.\nDon Quixote paid no attention to this, but Becky gave him another look.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not as dumb as you look, Digit,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI do not care about Dulcinea\u2019s appearance,\u201d Don Quixote declared, \u201cI love only the goodness that dwells in her coraz\u00f3n.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s Princess Gigunda!\u201d Jamie shouted, jumping up and down in enthusiasm. \u201cShe\u2019s been Princess Gigunda all along!\u201d\nAnd so, the children following, Don Quixote ran clanking to where Princess Gigunda waited near Jamie\u2019s house, fell down to one knee, and began to kiss and weep over the Princess\u2019 hand. The Princess seemed a little surprised by this until Becky told her that she was really the long-lost Dulcinea, changed into a giant by an evil magician, although she probably didn\u2019t remember it because that was part of the spell, too.\nSo while the Don and the Princess embraced, kissed, and began to warble a love duet, Becky turned to Jamie.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that stuff about the floating head?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhere did you come up with that?\u201d\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jamie said. He didn\u2019t want to talk about his memory of his family being turned to stone, the eerie glowing figure floating before them. He didn\u2019t want to remember how everyone said it was just a dream.\nHe didn\u2019t want to talk about the suspicions that had never quite gone away.\n\u201cThat stuff was weird, Digit,\u201d Becky said. \u201cIt gave me the creeps. Let me know before you start talking about stuff like that again.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you call me Digit?\u201d Jamie asked. Becky smirked.\n\u201cNo reason,\u201d she said.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s home!\u201d Mister Jeepers\u2019 voice warbled from the sky. Jamie looked up to see Mister Jeepers doing joyful aerial loops overhead. \u201cMaster Jamie\u2019s home at last!\u201d\n\u201cWhere shall we go?\u201d Jamie asked.\nTheir lessons for the day were over, and he and Becky were leaving the little red schoolhouse. Becky, as usual, had done very well on her lessons, better than her older brother, and Jamie felt a growing sense of annoyance. At least he was still better at Latin and computer science.\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d Becky said. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d\n\u201cHow about Pandaland? We could ride the Whoosh Machine.\u201d\nBecky wrinkled her face. \u201cI\u2019m tired of that kid stuff,\u201d she said.\nJamie looked at her. \u201cBut you\u2019re a kid.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not as little as you, Digit,\u201d Becky said.\nJamie glared. This was too much. \u201cYou\u2019re my little sister! I\u2019m bigger than you!\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Becky said. She stood before him, her arms flung out in exasperation. \u201cJust notice something for once, will you?\u201d\nJamie bit back on his temper and looked, and he saw that Becky was, in fact, bigger than he was. And older-looking. Puzzlement replaced his fading anger.\n\u201cHow did you get so big?\u201d Jamie asked.\n\u201cI grew. And you didn\u2019t grow. Not as fast anyway.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nBecky\u2019s lip curled. \u201cAsk Mom or Dad. Just ask them.\u201d Her expression turned stony. \u201cBut don\u2019t believe everything they tell you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nBecky looked angry for a moment, and then her expression relaxed. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cjust go to Pandaland and have fun, okay? You don\u2019t need me for that. I want to go and make some calls to my friends.\u201d\n\u201cWhat friends?\u201d\nBecky looked angry again. \u201cMy friends. It doesn\u2019t matter who they are!\u201d\n\u201cFine!\u201d Jamie shouted. \u201cI can have fun by myself!\u201d\nBecky turned and began to walk home, her legs scissoring against the background of the green grass. Jamie glared after her, then turned and began the walk to Pandaland.\nHe did all his favorite things, rode the Ferris wheel and the Whoosh Machine, watched Rizzio the Strongman and the clowns. He enjoyed himself, but his enjoyment felt hollow. He found himself watching, watching himself at play, watching himself enjoying the rides.\nWatching himself not grow as fast as his little sister.\nWatching himself wondering whether or not to ask his parents about why that was.\nHe had the idea that he wouldn\u2019t like their answers.\nHe didn\u2019t see as much of Becky after that. They would share lessons, and then Becky would lock herself in her room to talk to her friends on the phone.\nBecky didn\u2019t have a telephone in her room, though. He looked once when she wasn\u2019t there.\nAfter a while, Becky stopped accompanying him for lessons. She\u2019d got ahead of him on everything except Latin, and it was too hard for Jamie to keep up.\nAfter that, he hardly saw Becky at all. But when he saw her, he saw that she was still growing fast. Her clothing was different, and her hair. She\u2019d started wearing makeup.\nHe didn\u2019t know whether he liked her anymore or not.\nIt was Jamie\u2019s birthday. He was eleven years old, and Momma and Daddy and Becky had all come for a party. Don Quixote and Princess Gigunda serenaded Jamie from outside the window, accompanied by La Duchesa on Spanish guitar. There was a big cake with eleven candles. Momma gave Jamie a chart of the stars. When he touched a star, a voice would appear telling Jamie about the star, and lines would appear on the chart showing any constellation the star happened to belong to. Daddy gave Jamie a car, a miniature Mercedes convertible, scaled to Jamie\u2019s size, which he could drive around the country and which he could use in the Circus Maximus when the chariots weren\u2019t racing.\nHis sister gave Jamie a kind of lamp stand that would project lights and moving patterns on the walls and ceiling when the lights were off. \u201cListen to music when you use it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThank you, Becky,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cBecca,\u201d she said. \u201cMy name is Becca now. Try to remember.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cBecca.\u201d\nBecky\u2014Becca\u2014looked at Momma. \u201cI\u2019m dying for a cigarette,\u201d she said. \u201cCan I go, uh, out for a minute?\u201d\nMomma hesitated, but Daddy looked severe. \u201cBecca,\u201d she said, \u201cthis is Jamie\u2019s birthday. We\u2019re all here to celebrate. So why don\u2019t we all eat some cake and have a nice time?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even real cake,\u201d Becca said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste like real cake.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice cake,\u201d Daddy insisted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we talk about this later? Let\u2019s just have a special time for Jamie.\u201d\nBecca stood up from the table. \u201cFor the Digit?\u201d she said. \u201cWhy are we having a good time for Jamie? He\u2019s not even a real person!\u201d She thumped herself on the chest. \u201cI\u2019m a real person!\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ever have special times for me?\u201d\nBut Daddy was on his feet by that point and shouting, and Momma was trying to get everyone to be quiet, and Becca was shouting back, and suddenly a determined look entered her face and she just disappeared\u2014suddenly, she wasn\u2019t there anymore, there was just only air.\nJamie began to cry. So did Momma. Daddy paced up and down and swore, and then he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to go get her.\u201d Jamie was afraid he\u2019d disappear like Becca, and he gave a cry of despair, but Daddy didn\u2019t disappear, he just stalked out of the dining room and slammed the door behind him.\nMomma pulled Jamie onto her lap and hugged him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jamie,\u201d she said. \u201cBecky just did that to be mean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jamie asked.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Momma stroked his hair. \u201cIt was just a mean trick.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s growing up,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cShe\u2019s grown faster than me and I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cWait till Daddy gets back,\u201d Momma said, \u201cand we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d\nBut Daddy was clearly in no mood for talking when he returned, without Becca. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun,\u201d he snarled, and reached for the knife to cut the cake.\nThe cake tasted like ashes in Jamie\u2019s mouth. When the Don and Princess Gigunda, Mister Jeepers, and Rizzio the Strongman came into the dining room and sang \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d it was all Jamie could do to hold back the tears.\nAfterwards, he drove his new car to the Circus Maximus and drove as fast as he could on the long oval track. The car really wouldn\u2019t go very fast. The bleachers on either side were empty, and so was the blue sky above.\nMaybe it was a puzzle, he thought, like Princess Gigunda\u2019s love life. Maybe all he had to do was follow the right clue, and everything would be fine.\nWhat\u2019s the moral they\u2019re trying to teach? he wondered.\nBut all he could do was go in circles, around and around the empty stadium.\n\u201cHey, Digit. Wake up.\u201d\nJamie came awake suddenly, with a stifled cry. The room whirled around him. He blinked, realized that the whirling came from the colored lights projected by his birthday present, Becca\u2019s lamp stand.\nBecca was sitting on his bedroom chair, a cigarette in her hand. Her feet, in the steel-capped boots she\u2019d been wearing lately, were propped up on the bed.\n\u201cAre you awake, Jamie?\u201d It was Selena\u2019s voice. \u201cWould you like me to sing you a lullaby?\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, Selena,\u201d Becca said. \u201cGet out of here. Get lost.\u201d\nSelena cast Becca a mournful look, then sailed backwards, out the window, riding a beam of moonlight to her pale home in the sky. Jamie watched her go, and felt as if a part of himself was going with her, a part that he would never see again.\n\u201cSelena and the others have to do what you tell them, mostly,\u201d Becca said. \u201cOf course, Mom and Dad wouldn\u2019t tell you that.\u201d\nJamie looked at Becca. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d he said. \u201cWhere did you go today?\u201d\nColored lights swam over Becca\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I spoiled your birthday, Digit. I just got tired of the lies, you know? They\u2019d kill me if they knew I was here now, talking to you.\u201d\nBecca took a draw on her cigarette, held her breath for a second or two, then exhaled. Jamie didn\u2019t see or taste any smoke.\n\u201cYou know what they wanted me to do?\u201d she said. \u201cWear a little girl\u2019s body, so I wouldn\u2019t look any older than you, and keep you company in that stupid school for seven hours a day.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it. They yelled and yelled, but I was damned if I would.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nBecca flicked invisible ashes off her cigarette, and looked at Jamie for a long time. Then she sighed.\n\u201cDo you remember when you were in the hospital?\u201d she said.\nJamie nodded. \u201cI was really sick.\u201d\n\u201cI was so little then, I don\u2019t really remember it very well,\u201d Becca said. \u201cBut the point is\u2014\u201d She sighed again. \u201cThe point is that you weren\u2019t getting well. So they decided to\u2014\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDad took advantage of his position at the University, and the fact that he\u2019s been a big doner. They were doing AI research, and the neurology department was into brain modeling, and they needed a test subject, and\u2014Well, the idea is, they\u2019ve got some of your tissue, and when they get cloning up and running, they\u2019ll put you back in\u2014\u201d She saw Jamie\u2019s stare, then shook her head.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make it simple, okay?\u201d\nShe took her feet off the bed and leaned closer to Jamie. A shiver ran up his back at her expression. \u201cThey made a copy of you. An electronic copy. They scanned your brain and built a holographic model of it inside a computer, and they put it in a virtual environment, and\u2014\u201d She sat back, took a drag on her cigarette. \u201cAnd here you are,\u201d she said.\nJamie looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nColored lights gleamed in Becca\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re in a computer, okay? And you\u2019re a program. You know what that is, right? From computer class? And the program is sort of in the shape of your mind. Don Quixote and Princess Gigunda are programs, too. And Mrs. Winkle down at the schoolhouse is usually a program, but if she needs to teach something complex, then she\u2019s an education major from the University.\u201d\nJamie felt as if he\u2019d just been hollowed out, a void inside his ribs. \u201cI\u2019m not real?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a person?\u201d\n\u201cWrong,\u201d Becca said. \u201cYou\u2019re real, alright. You\u2019re the apple of our parents\u2019 eye.\u201d Her tone was bitter. \u201cPrograms are real things,\u201d she said, \u201cand yours was a real hack, you know, absolute cutting-edge state-of-the-art technoshit. And the computer that you\u2019re in is real, too\u2014I\u2019m interfaced with it right now, down in the family room\u2014we have to wear suits with sensors and a helmet with scanners and stuff. I hope to fuck they don\u2019t hear me talking to you down here.\u201d\n\u201cBut what\u2014\u201d Jamie swallowed hard. How could he swallow if he was just a string of code? \u201cWhat happened to me? The original me?\u201d\nBecca looked cold. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cyou had cancer. You died.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d A hollow wind blew through the void inside him.\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to bring you back. As soon as the clone thing works out\u2014but this is a government computer you\u2019re in, and there are all these government restrictions on cloning, and\u2014\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cLook, Digit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou really need to know this stuff, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Jamie wanted to cry. But only real people cried, he thought, and he wasn\u2019t real. He wasn\u2019t real.\n\u201cThe program that runs this virtual environment is huge, okay, and you\u2019re a big program, and the University computer is used for a lot of research, and a lot of the research has a higher priority than you do. So you don\u2019t run in real-time\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m growing faster than you are.\n\u201cI\u2019m spending more hours being me than you are. And the parents\u2014\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cThey aren\u2019t making this any better, with their emphasis on normal family life.\u201d\nShe sucked on her cigarette, then stubbed it out in something invisible. \u201cSee, they want us to be this normal family. So we have breakfast together every day, and dinner every night, and spend the evening at the Zoo or in Pandaland or someplace. But the dinner that we eat with you is virtual, it doesn\u2019t taste like anything\u2014the grant ran out before they got that part of the interface right\u2014so we eat this fast-food crap before we interface with you, and then have dinner all over again with you . . . Is this making any sense? Because Dad has a job and Mom has a job and I go to school and have friends and stuff, so we really can\u2019t get together every night. So they just close your program file, shut it right down, when they\u2019re not available to interface with you as what Dad calls a \u2018family unit,\u2019 and that means that there are a lot of hours, days sometimes, when you\u2019re just not running, you might as well really be dead\u2014\u201d She blinked. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyway, we\u2019re all getting older a lot faster than you are, and it\u2019s not fair to you, that\u2019s what I think. Especially because the University computer runs fastest at night, because people don\u2019t use them as much then, and you\u2019re pretty much real-time then, so interfacing with you would be almost normal, but Mom and Dad sleep then, cuz they have day jobs, and they can\u2019t have you running around unsupervised in here, for God\u2019s sake, they think it\u2019s unsafe or something . . . \u201d\nShe paused, then reached into her shirt pocket for another cigarette. \u201cLook,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019d better get out of here before they figure out I\u2019m talking to you. And then they\u2019ll pull my access codes or something.\u201d She stood, brushed something off her jeans. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the parents about this stuff right away. Otherwise they must might erase you, and load a backup that doesn\u2019t know shit. Okay?\u201d\nAnd she vanished, as she had that afternoon.\nJamie sat in the bed, hugging his knees. He could feel his heart beating in the darkness. How can a program have a heart? he wondered.\nDawn slowly encroached upon the night, and then there was Mister Jeepers, turning lazy cartwheels in the air, his red face leering in the window.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s awake!\u201d he said. \u201cJamie\u2019s awake and ready for a new day!\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Jamie said, and buried his face in the blanket.\nJamie asked to learn more about computers and programming. Maybe, he thought, he could find clues there, he could solve the puzzle. His parents agreed, happy to let him follow his interests.\nAfter a few weeks, he moved into El Castillo. He didn\u2019t tell anyone he was going, he just put some of his things in his car, took them up to a tower room, and threw them down on the bed he found there. His Mom came to find him when he didn\u2019t come home for dinner.\n\u201cIt\u2019s dinnertime, Jamie,\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the dinner bell?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stay here for a while,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to get hungry if you don\u2019t come home for dinner.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need food,\u201d Jamie said.\nHis Mom smiled brightly. \u201cYou need food if you\u2019re going to keep up with the Whirlikins,\u201d she said.\nJamie looked at her. \u201cI don\u2019t care about that kid stuff anymore,\u201d he said.\nWhen his mother finally turned and left, Jamie noticed that she moved like an old person.\nAfter a while, he got used to the hunger that was programmed into him. It was always there, he was always aware of it, but he got so he could ignore it after awhile.\nBut he couldn\u2019t ignore the need to sleep. That was just built into the program, and eventually, try though he might, he needed to give in to it.\nHe found out he could order the people in the castle around, and he amused himself by making them stand in embarrassing positions, or stand on their head and sing, or form human pyramids for hours and hours.\nSometimes he made them fight, but they weren\u2019t very good at it.\nHe couldn\u2019t make Mrs. Winkle at the schoolhouse do whatever he wanted, though, or any of the people who were supposed to teach him things. When it was time for a lesson, Princess Gigunda turned up. She wouldn\u2019t follow his orders, she\u2019d just pick him up and carry him to the little red schoolhouse and plunk him down in his seat.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not real!\u201d he shouted, kicking in her arms. \u201cYou\u2019re not real! And I\u2019m not real, either!\u201d\nBut they made him learn about the world that was real, about geography and geology and history, although none of it mattered here.\nAfter the first couple times Jamie had been dragged to school, his father met him outside the schoolhouse at the end of the day.\n\u201cYou need some straightening out,\u201d he said. He looked grim. \u201cYou\u2019re part of a family. You belong with us. You\u2019re not going to stay in the castle anymore, you\u2019re going to have a normal family life.\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Jamie shouted. \u201cI like the castle!\u201d\nDad grabbed him by the arm and began to drag him homeward. Jamie called him a pendejo and a fellator.\n\u201cI\u2019ll punish you if I have to,\u201d his father said.\n\u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d Jamie demanded. \u201cYou gonna erase my file? Load a backup?\u201d\nA stunned expression crossed his father\u2019s face. His body seemed to go through a kind of stutter, and the grip on Jamie\u2019s arm grew nerveless. Then his face flushed with anger. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWho told you this?\u201d\nJamie wrenched himself free of Dad\u2019s weakened grip. \u201cI figured it out by myself,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard. I\u2019m not a kid anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d His father blinked, and then his face hardened. \u201cYou\u2019re still coming home.\u201d\nJamie backed away. \u201cI want some changes!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be shut off all the time.\u201d\nDad\u2019s mouth compressed to a thin line. \u201cIt was Becky who told you this, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJamie felt an inspiration. \u201cIt was Mister Jeepers! There\u2019s a flaw in his programming! He answers whatever question I ask him!\u201d\nJamie\u2019s father looked uncertain. He held out his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to think about this.\u201d\nJamie hesitated. \u201cDon\u2019t erase me,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t load a backup. Please. I don\u2019t want to die twice.\u201d\nDad\u2019s look softened. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI want to grow up,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a little kid forever.\u201d\nDad held out his hand again. Jamie thought for a moment, then took the hand. They walked over the green grass toward the white frame house on the hill.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s home!\u201d Mister Jeepers floated overhead, turning aerial cartwheels. \u201cJamie\u2019s home at last!\u201d\nA spasm of anger passed through Jamie at the sight of the witless grin. He pointed at the ground in front of him.\n\u201cCrash right here!\u201d he ordered. \u201cFast!\u201d\nMister Jeepers came spiraling down, an expression of comic terror on his face, and smashed to the ground where Jamie pointed. Jamie pointed at the sight of the crumpled body and laughed.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s home at last!\u201d Mister Jeepers said.\nAs soon as Jamie could, he got one of the programmers at the University to fix him up a flight program like the one Mister Jeepers had been using. He swooped and soared, zooming like a super hero through the sky, stunting between the towers of El Castillo and soaring over upturned, wondering faces in the Forum.\nHe couldn\u2019t seem to go as fast as he really wanted. When he started increasing speed, all the scenery below paused in its motion for a second or two, then jumped forward with a jerk. The software couldn\u2019t refresh the scenery fast enough to match his speed. It felt strange, because throughout his flight he could feel the wind on his face.\nSo this, he thought, was why his car couldn\u2019t go fast.\nSo he decided to climb high. He turned his face to the blue sky and went straight up. The world receded, turned small. He could see the Castle, the hills of Whirlikin Country, the crowded Forum, the huge oval of the Circus Maximus. It was like a green plate, with a fuzzy, nebulous horizon where the sky started.\nAnd, right in the center, was the little two-story frame house where he\u2019d grown up.\nIt was laid out below him like scenery in a snow globe.\nAfter a while he stopped climbing. It took him a while to realize it, because he still felt the wind blowing in his face, but the world below stopped getting smaller.\nHe tried going faster. The wind blasted onto him from above, but his position didn\u2019t change. He\u2019d reached the limits of his world. He couldn\u2019t get any higher.\nJamie flew out to the edges of the world, to the horizon. No matter how he urged his program to move, he couldn\u2019t make his world fade away.\nHe was trapped inside the snow globe, and there was no way out.\nIt was quite a while before Jamie saw Becca again. She picked her way through the labyrinth beneath El Castillo to his throne room, and Jamie slowly materialized atop his throne of skulls.\nShe didn\u2019t appear surprised.\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve got a little Dark Lord thing going here,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt passes the time,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cAnd all those pits and stakes and tripwires?\u201d\n\u201cDeath traps.\u201d\n\u201cTook me forever to get in here, Digit. I kept getting de-rezzed.\u201d\nJamie smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea.\u201d\n\u201cWhirlikins as weapons,\u201d she nodded. \u201cThat was a good one. Bored a hole right through me, the first time.\u201d\n\u201cSince I\u2019m stuck living here,\u201d Jamie said, \u201cI figure I might as well be in charge of the environment. Some of the student programmers at the University helped me with some cool effects.\u201d\nScreams echoed through the throne room. Fires leaped out of pits behind him. The flames illuminated a form of Marcus Tullius Cicero, who hung crucified above a sea of flame.\n\u201cO tempora, o mores!\u201d moaned Cicero.\nBecca nodded. \u201cNice,\u201d she said. \u201cNot my scene exactly, but nice.\u201d\n\u201cSince I can\u2019t leave,\u201d Jamie said, \u201cI want a say in who gets to visit. So either you wait till I\u2019m ready to talk to you, or you take your chances on the death traps.\u201d\n\u201cWell. Looks like you\u2019re sitting pretty, then.\u201d\nJamie shrugged. Flames belched. \u201cI\u2019m getting bored with it. I might just wipe it all out and build another place to live in. I can\u2019t tell you the number of battles I\u2019ve won, the number of kingdoms I\u2019ve trampled. In this reality and others. It\u2019s all the same after a while.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown.\u201d\n\u201cSo have you.\u201d\n\u201cOnce the paterfamilias finally decided to allow it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cWe still have dinner together sometimes, in the old house. Just a normal family, as Dad says. Except that sometimes I turn up in the form of a werewolf, or a giant, or something.\u201d\n\u201cSo they tell me.\u201d\n\u201cThe advantage of being software is that I can look like anything I want. But that\u2019s the disadvantage, too, because I can\u2019t really become something else, I\u2019m still just . . . me. I may wear another program as a disguise, but I\u2019m still the same program inside, and I\u2019m not a good enough programmer to mess with that, yet.\u201d Jamie hopped off his throne, walked a nervous little circle around his sister. \u201cSo what brings you to the old neighborhood?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe old folks said you were off visiting Aunt Maddy in the country.\u201d\n\u201cExiled, they mean. I got knocked up, and after the abortion they sent me to Maddy. She was supposed to keep me under control, except she didn\u2019t.\u201d She picked an invisible piece of lint from her sweater. \u201cSo now I\u2019m back.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m skipping a lot of the story, but I figure you wouldn\u2019t be interested.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it have to do with sex?\u201d Jamie asked. \u201cI\u2019m sort of interested in sex, even though I can\u2019t do it, and they\u2019re not likely to let me.\u201d\n\u201cLet you?\u201d\n\u201cIt would require a lot of new software and stuff. I was prepubescent when my brain structures were scanned, and the program isn\u2019t set up for making me a working adult, with adult desires et cetera. Nobody was thinking about putting me through adolescence at the time. And the administrators at the University told me that it was very unlikely that anyone was going to give them a grant so that a computer program could have sex.\u201d Jamie shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t miss it, I guess. But I\u2019m sort of curious.\u201d\nSurprise crossed Becca\u2019s face. \u201cBut there are all kinds of simulations, and . . . \u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t work for me, because my mind isn\u2019t structured so as to be able to achieve pleasure that way. I can manipulate the programs, but it\u2019s about as exciting as working a virtual butter churn.\u201d Jamie shrugged again. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. I mean, I don\u2019t miss it. I can always give myself a jolt to the pleasure center if I want.\u201d\n\u201cNot the same thing,\u201d Becca said. \u201cI\u2019ve done both.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you about sex if you want,\u201d Becca said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\nBecca hesitated. Licked her lips. \u201cI guess I should just say it, huh?\u201d she said. \u201cMom\u2019s dying. Pancreatic cancer.\u201d\nJamie felt sadness well up in his mind. Only electrons, he thought, moving from one place to another. It was nothing real. He was programmed to feel an analog of sorrow, and that was all.\n\u201cShe looks normal to me,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I see her.\u201d But that didn\u2019t mean anything: his mother chose what she wanted him to see, just as he chose a mask\u2014a werewolf, a giant\u2014for her.\nAnd in neither case did the disguise at all matter. For behind the werewolf was a program that couldn\u2019t alter its parameters; and behind the other, ineradicable cancer.\nBecca watched him from slitted eyes. \u201cDad wants her to be scanned, and come here. So we can still be a normal family even after she dies.\u201d\nJamie was horrified. \u201cTell her no,\u201d he said. \u201cTell her she can\u2019t come!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she wants to. But Dad is very insistent.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be here forever! It\u2019ll be awful!\u201d\nBecca looked around. \u201cWell, she wouldn\u2019t do much for your Dark Lord act, that\u2019s for sure. I\u2019m sure Sauron\u2019s mom didn\u2019t hang around the Dark Tower, nagging him about the unproductive way he was spending his time.\u201d\nFires belched. The ground trembled. Stalactites rained down like arrows.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be here no matter what I\u2019m doing, no matter where I live. Because whatever this place looks like, it\u2019s a prison.\u201d Jamie looked at his sister. \u201cI don\u2019t want my mom in a prison.\u201d\nLeaping flames glittered in Becca\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou can change the world you live in,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I can do.\u201d\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI can change the way it looks, but I can\u2019t change anything real. I\u2019m a program, and a program is an artifact. I\u2019m a piece of engineering. I\u2019m a simulation, with simulated sensory organs that interact with simulated environments\u2014I can only interact with other artifacts. None of it\u2019s real. I don\u2019t know what the real world looks or feels or tastes like, I only know what simulations tell me they\u2019re supposed to taste like. And I can\u2019t change any of my parameters unless I mess with the engineering, and I can\u2019t do that unless the programmers agree, and even when that happens, I\u2019m still as artificial as I was before. And the computer I\u2019m in is old and clunky, and soon nobody\u2019s going to run my operating system anymore, and I\u2019ll not only be an artifact, I\u2019ll be a museum piece.\u201d\n\u201cThere are other artificial intelligences out there,\u201d Becca said. \u201cI keep hearing about them.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to them. Most of them aren\u2019t very interesting\u2014it\u2019s like talking to a dog, or maybe to very intelligent microwave oven. And they\u2019ve scanned some people in, but those were adults, and all they wanted to do, once they got inside, was to escape. Some of them went crazy.\u201d\nBecca gave a twisted smile. \u201cI used to be so jealous of you, you know. You lived in this beautiful world, no pollution, no violence, no shit on the streets.\u201d\nFlames belched.\n\u201cIntegra mens augustissima possessio,\u201d said Cicero.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Jamie told him. \u201cWhat the fuck do you know?\u201d\nBecca shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen those old movies, you know? Where somebody gets turned into a computer program, and next thing you know he\u2019s in every computer in the world, and running everything?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen those, too. Ha ha. Very funny. Shows you what people know about programs.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Shows you what they know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mom,\u201d Jamie said.\nBig tears welled out of Mom\u2019s eyes and trailed partway down her face, then disappeared. The scanners paid a lot of attention to eyes and mouths, for the sake of transmitting expression, but didn\u2019t always pick up the things between.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think this is how it would be.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you should have given it more thought,\u201d Jamie said.\nIt isn\u2019t sorrow, he told himself again. It\u2019s just electrons moving.\n\u201cYou were such a beautiful baby.\u201d Her lower lip trembled. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to lose you. They said that it would only be a few years before they could implant your memories in a clone.\u201d\nJamie knew all that by now. Knew that the technology of reading memories turned out to be much, much simpler than implanting them\u2014it had been discovered that the implantation had to be made while the brain was actually growing. And government restrictions on human cloning had made tests next to impossible, and the team that had started his project had split up years ago, some to higher-paying jobs, some retired, others to pet projects of their own. How his father had long ago used up whatever pull he\u2019d had at the University trying to keep everything together. And how he long ago had acquired or purchased patents and copyrights for the whole scheme, except for Jamie\u2019s program, which was still owned jointly by the University and the family.\nTears reappeared on Mom\u2019s lower face, dripped off her chin. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially a lot of money at stake, you know. People want to raise perfect children. Keep them away from bad influences, make sure that they\u2019re raised free from violence.\u201d\n\u201cSo they want to control the kid\u2019s entire environment,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cYes. And make it safe. And wholesome. And\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJust like normal family life,\u201d Jamie finished. \u201cNo diapers, no vomit, no messes. No having to interact with the kid when the parents are tired. And then you just download the kid into an adult body, give him a diploma, and kick him out of the house. And call yourself a perfect parent.\u201d\n\u201cAnd there are religious people . . . \u201d Mom licked her lips. \u201cYour Dad\u2019s been talking to them. They want to raise children in environments that reflect their beliefs completely. Places where there is no temptation, no sin. No science or ideas that contradict their own . . . \u201d\n\u201cBut Dad isn\u2019t religious,\u201d Jamie said.\n\u201cThese people have money. Lots of money.\u201d Mom reached out, took his hand. Jamie thought about all the code that enabled her to do it, that enabled them both to feel the pressure of unreal flesh on unreal flesh.\n\u201cI\u2019ll do what you wish, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have that desire for immortality, the way your father does.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what your father will do once his time comes.\u201d\nThe world was a disk a hundred meters across, covered with junk: old Roman ruins, gargoyles fallen from a castle wall, a broken chariot, a shattered bell. Outside the rim of the world, the sky was black, utterly black, without a ripple or a star.\nStanding in the center of the world was a kind of metal tree with two forked, jagged arms.\n\u201cHi, Digit,\u201d Becca said.\nA dull fitful light gleamed on the metal tree, as if it were reflecting a bloody sunset.\n\u201cHi, sis,\u201d it said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Becca said. \u201cWe\u2019re alone now.\u201d\n\u201cI caught the notice of Dad\u2019s funeral. I hope nobody missed me.\u201d\n\u201cI missed you, Digit.\u201d Becca sighed. \u201cBelieve it or not.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nBecca restlessly kicked a piece of junk, a hubcap from an old, miniature car. It clanged as it found new lodgement in the rubble. \u201cCan you appear as a person?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt would make it easier to talk to you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve finished with all that,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cI\u2019d have to resurrect too much dead programming. I\u2019ve cut the world down to next to nothing, I\u2019ve got rid of my body, my heartbeat, the sense of touch.\u201d\n\u201cAll the human parts,\u201d Becca said sadly.\nThe dull red light oozed over the metal tree like a drop of blood. \u201cEverything except sleep and dreams. It turns out that sleep and dreams have too much to do with the way people process memory. I can\u2019t get rid of them, not without cutting out too much of my mind.\u201d The tree gave a strange, disembodied laugh. \u201cI dreamed about you, the other day. And about Cicero. We were talking Latin.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten all the Latin I ever knew.\u201d Becca tossed her hair, forced a laugh. \u201cSo what do you do nowadays?\u201d\n\u201cMostly I\u2019m a conduit for data. The University has been using me as a research spider, which I don\u2019t mind doing, because it passes the time. Except that I take up a lot more memory than any real search spider, and don\u2019t do that much better a job. And the information I find doesn\u2019t have much to do with me\u2014it\u2019s all about the real world. The world I can\u2019t touch.\u201d The metal tree bled color.\n\u201cMostly,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting for Dad to die. And now it\u2019s happened.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence before Becca spoke. \u201cYou know that dad had himself scanned before he went.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah. I knew.\u201d\n\u201cHe set up some kind of weird foundation that I\u2019m not part of, with his patents and programs and so on, and his money and some other people\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d better not turn up here.\u201d\nBecca shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t. Not without your permission, anyway. Because I\u2019m in charge here. You\u2014your program\u2014it\u2019s not a part of the foundation. Dad couldn\u2019t get it all, because the University has an interest, and so does the family.\u201d There was a moment of silence. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the family now.\u201d\n\u201cSo you . . . inherited me,\u201d Jamie said. Cold scorn dripped from his words.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Becca said. She squatted down amid the rubble, rested her forearms on her knees.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do, Digit? What can I do to make it better for you?\u201d\n\u201cNo one ever asked me that,\u201d Jamie said.\nThere was another long silence.\n\u201cShut it off,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cClose the file. Erase it.\u201d\nBecca swallowed hard. Tears shimmered in her eyes. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if they ever perfect the clone thing? If we could make you . . . \u201d She took a breath. \u201cA person?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s too late. It\u2019s . . . not something I can want anymore.\u201d\nBecca stood. Ran a hand through her hair. \u201cI wish you could meet my daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cHer name is Christy. She\u2019s a real beauty.\u201d\n\u201cYou can bring her,\u201d Jamie said.\nBecca shook her head. \u201cThis place would scare her. She\u2019s only three. I\u2019d only bring her if we could have . . . \u201d\n\u201cThe old environment,\u201d Jamie finished. \u201cPandaland. Mister Jeepers. Whirlikin Country.\u201d\nBecca forced a smile. \u201cThose were happy days,\u201d she said. \u201cThey really were. I was jealous of you, I know, but when I look back at that time . . . \u201d She wiped tears with the back of her hand. \u201cIt was the best.\u201d\n\u201cVirtual environments are nice places to visit, I guess,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want to live in one. Not forever.\u201d Becca looked down at her feet, planted amid rubble.\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure about what you want.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\nShe looked up at the metal form, raised a hand. \u201cGoodbye, Jamie,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said.\nShe faded from the world.\nAnd in time, the world and the tree faded, too.\nHand in hand, Daddy and Jamie walked to Whirlikin Country. Jamie had never seen the Whirlikins before, and he laughed and laughed as the Whirlikins spun beneath their orange sky.\nThe sound of a bell rang over the green hills. \u201cTime for dinner, Jamie,\u201d Daddy said.\nJamie waved goodbye to the Whirlikins, and he and Daddy walked briskly over the fresh green grass toward home.\n\u201cAre you happy, Jamie?\u201d Daddy asked.\n\u201cYes, Daddy!\u201d Jamie nodded. \u201cI only wish Momma and Becky could be here with us.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be here soon.\u201d\nWhen, he thought, they can get the simulations working properly.\nBecause this time, he thought, there would be no mistakes. The foundation he\u2019d set up before he died had finally purchased the University\u2019s interest in Jamie\u2019s program\u2014they funded some scholarships, that was all it finally took. There was no one in the Computer Department who had an interest anymore.\nJamie had been loaded from an old backup\u2014there was no point in using the corrupt file that Jamie had become, the one that had turned itself into a tree, for heaven\u2019s sake.\nThe old world was up and running, with a few improvements. The foundation had bought their own computer\u2014an old one, so it wasn\u2019t too expensive\u2014that would run the environment full time. Some other children might be scanned, to give Jamie some playmates and peer socialization.\nThis time it would work, Daddy thought. Because this time, Daddy was a program too, and he was going to be here every minute, making sure that the environment was correct and that everything went exactly according to plan. That he and Jamie and everyone else had a normal family life, perfect and shining and safe.\nAnd if the clone program ever worked out, they would come into the real world again. And if downloading into clones was never perfected, then they would stay here.\nThere was nothing wrong with the virtual environment. It was a good place.\nJust like normal family life. Only forever.\nAnd when this worked out, the foundation\u2019s backers\u2014fine people, even if they did have some strange religious ideas\u2014would have their own environments up and running. With churches, angels, and perhaps even the presence of God . . .\n\u201cLook!\u201d Daddy said, pointing. \u201cIt\u2019s Mister Jeepers!\u201d\nMister Jeepers flew off the rooftop and spun happy spirals in the air as he swooped toward Jamie. Jamie dropped Daddy\u2019s hand and ran laughing to greet his friend.\n\u201cJamie\u2019s home!\u201d Mister Jeepers cried. \u201cJamie\u2019s home at last!\u201d\nOriginally published in Not of Woman Born, edited by Constance Ash, 1999.\nWalter Jon Williams is an award-winning author who has been listed on the best-seller lists of the New York Times and the Times of London.

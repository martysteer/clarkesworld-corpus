They appeared overnight, a dozen incongruous soap-bubble structures scattered across the North American continent. One of them blocked a major Interstate in Ohio; another monopolized a stadium parking lot in Tulsa. But most stood in cornfields and forests and deserts where they caused little inconvenience.\n Everyone called them spaceships, but from the beginning the experts questioned that name. NORAD had recorded no incoming landing craft, and no mother ship orbited above. That left two main possibilities: they were visitations from an alien race that traveled by some incomprehensibly advanced method; or they were a mutant eruption of Earth\u2019s own tortured ecosystem.\n The domes were impervious. Probing radiation bounced off them, as did potshots from locals in the days before the military moved in to cordon off the areas. Attempts to communicate produced no reaction. All the domes did was sit there reflecting the sky in luminous, dreaming colors.\n Six months later, the panic had subsided and even CNN had grown weary of reporting breaking news that was just the same old news. Then, entry panels began to open and out walked the translators, one per dome. They were perfectly ordinary-looking human beings who said that they had been abducted as children and had now come back to interpret between their biological race and the people who had adopted them.\n Humanity learned surprisingly little from the translators. The aliens had come in peace. They had no demands and no questions. They merely wanted to sit here minding their own business for a while. They wanted to be left alone.\n No one believed it.\n Avery was visiting her brother when her boss called.\n \u201cSay, you\u2019ve still got those security credentials, right?\u201d Frank said.\n \u201cYes . . . \u201d She had gotten the security clearance in order to haul a hush-hush load of nuclear fuel to Nevada, a feat she wasn\u2019t keen on repeating.\n \u201cAnd you\u2019re in D.C.?\u201d\n She was actually in northern Virginia, but close enough. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve got a job for you.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s another gig for Those We Dare Not Name.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t laugh, which told her it was bad. \u201cUh . . . no. More like those we can\u2019t name.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t get it. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cSome . . . neighbors. Who live in funny-shaped houses. I can\u2019t say more over the phone.\u201d\n She got it then. \u201cFrank! You took a contract from the frigging aliens?\u201d\n \u201cSssh,\u201d he said, as if every phone in America weren\u2019t bugged. \u201cIt\u2019s strictly confidential.\u201d\n \u201cJesus,\u201d she breathed out. She had done some crazy things for Frank, but this was over the top. \u201cWhen, where, what?\u201d\n \u201cLeaving tonight. D.C. to St. Louis. A converted tour bus.\u201d\n \u201cTour bus? How many of them are going?\u201d\n \u201cTwo passengers. One human, one . . . whatever. Will you do it?\u201d\n She looked into the immaculate condo living room, where her brother, Blake, and his husband, Jeff, were playing a noisy, fast-paced video game, oblivious to her conversation. She had promised to be at Blake\u2019s concert tomorrow. It meant a lot to him. \u201cJust a second,\u201d she said to Frank.\n \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said.\n \u201cTwo seconds.\u201d She muted the phone and walked into the living room. Blake saw her expression and paused the game.\n She said, \u201cWould you hate me if I couldn\u2019t be there tomorrow?\u201d\n Disappointment, resignation, and wry acceptance crossed his face, as if he hadn\u2019t ever really expected her to keep her promise. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cA job,\u201d she said. \u201cA really important job. Never mind, I\u2019ll turn it down.\u201d\n \u201cNo, Ave, don\u2019t worry. There will be other concerts.\u201d\n Still, she hesitated. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said. She and Blake had always hung together, like castaways on a hostile sea. They had given each other courage to sail into the wind. To disappoint him felt disloyal.\n \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ll be sorry if you stay.\u201d\n She thumbed the phone on. \u201cOkay, Frank, I\u2019ll do it. This better not get me in trouble.\u201d\n \u201cCross my heart and hope to die,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll email you instructions. Bye.\u201d\n From the couch, Jeff said, \u201cNow I know why you want to do it. Because it\u2019s likely to get you in trouble.\u201d\n \u201cNo, he gave me his word,\u201d Avery said.\n \u201cCowboy Frank? The one who had you drive guns to Nicaragua?\u201d\n \u201cThat was perfectly legal,\u201d Avery said.\n Jeff had a point, as usual. Specialty Shipping did the jobs no reputable company would handle. Ergo, so did Avery.\n \u201cWhat is it this time?\u201d Blake asked.\n \u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d The email had come through; Frank had attached the instructions as if a PDF were more secure than email. She opened and scanned them.\n The job had been cleared by the government, but the client was the alien passenger, and she was to take orders only from him, within the law. She scanned the rest of the instructions till she saw the pickup time. \u201cDamn, I\u2019ve got to get going,\u201d she said.\n Her brother followed her into the guest room to watch her pack up. He had never understood her nomadic lifestyle, which made his silent support for it all the more generous. She was compelled to wander; he was rooted in this home, this relationship, this warm, supportive community. She was a discarder, using things up and throwing them away; he had created a home that was a visual expression of himself\u2014from the spare, Japanese-style furniture to the Zen colors on the walls. Visiting him was like living inside a beautiful soul. She had no idea how they could have grown up so different. It was as if they were foundlings.\n She pulled on her boots and shouldered her backpack. Blake hugged her. \u201cHave a good trip,\u201d he said. \u201cCall me.\u201d\n \u201cWill do,\u201d she said, and hit the road again.\n The media had called the dome in Rock Creek Park the Mother Ship\u2014but only because of its proximity to the White House, not because it was in any way distinctive. Like the others, it had appeared overnight, sited on a broad, grassy clearing that had been a secluded picnic ground in the urban park. It filled the entire creek valley, cutting off the trails and greatly inconveniencing the joggers and bikers.\n Avery was unprepared for its scale. Like most people, she had seen the domes only on TV, and the small screen did not do justice to the neck-craning reality. She leaned forward over the wheel and peered out the windshield as she brought the bus to a halt at the last checkpoint. The National Park Police pickup that had escorted her through all the other checkpoints pulled aside.\n The appearance of an alien habitat had set off a battle of jurisdictions in Washington. The dome stood on U.S. Park Service property, but D.C. Police controlled all the access streets, and the U.S. Army was tasked with maintaining a perimeter around it. No agency wanted to surrender a particle of authority to the others. And then there was the polite, well-groomed young man who had introduced himself as \u201cHenry,\u201d now sitting in the passenger seat next to her. His neatly pressed suit sported no bulges of weaponry, but she assumed he was CIA.\n She now saw method in Frank\u2019s madness at calling her so spur-of-the-moment. Her last-minute arrival had prevented anyone from pulling her aside into a cinderblock room for a \u201cbriefing.\u201d Instead, Henry had accompanied her in the bus, chatting informally.\n \u201cSay, while you\u2019re on the road . . . \u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n \u201cNo?\u201d\n \u201cThe alien\u2019s my client. I don\u2019t spy on clients.\u201d\n He paused a moment, but seemed unruffled. \u201cNot even for your country?\u201d\n \u201cIf I think my country\u2019s in danger, I\u2019ll get in touch.\u201d\n \u201cFair enough,\u201d he said pleasantly. She hadn\u2019t expected him to give up so easily.\n He handed her a business card. \u201cSo you can get in touch,\u201d he said.\n She glanced at it. It said \u201cHenry,\u201d with a phone number. No logo, no agency, no last name. She put it in a pocket.\n \u201cI have to get out here,\u201d he said when the bus rolled to a halt a hundred yards from the dome. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice meeting you, Avery.\u201d\n \u201cTake your bug with you,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\n \u201cThe bug you left somewhere in this cab.\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no bug,\u201d he said seriously.\n Since the bus was probably wired like a studio, she shrugged and resolved not to scratch anywhere embarrassing till she had a chance to search. As she closed the door behind Henry, the soldiers removed the roadblock and she eased the bus forward.\n It was almost evening, but floodlights came on as she approached the dome. She pulled the bus parallel to the wall and lowered the wheelchair lift. One of the hexagonal panels slid aside, revealing a stocky, dark-haired young man in black glasses, surrounded by packing crates of the same pearly substance as the dome. Avery started forward to help with loading, but he said tensely, \u201cStay where you are.\u201d She obeyed. He pushed the first crate forward and it moved as if on wheels, though Avery could see none. It was slightly too wide for the lift, so the man put his hands on either side and pushed in. The crate reconfigured itself, growing taller and narrower till it fit onto the platform. Avery activated the power lift.\n He wouldn\u2019t let Avery touch any of the crates, but insisted on stowing them himself at the back of the bus, where a private bedroom suite had once accommodated a touring celebrity singer. When the last crate was on, he came forward and said, \u201cWe can go now.\u201d\n \u201cWhat about the other passenger?\u201d Avery said.\n \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d\n She realized that the alien must have been in one of the crates\u2014or, for all she knew, was one of the crates. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere to?\u201d\n \u201cAnywhere,\u201d he said, and turned to go back into the bedroom.\n Since she had no instructions to the contrary, Avery decided to head south. As she pulled out of the park, there was no police escort, no helicopter overhead, no obvious trailing car. The terms of this journey had been carefully negotiated at the highest levels, she knew. Their security was to be secrecy; no one was to know where they were. Avery\u2019s instructions from Frank had stressed that, aside from getting the alien safely where he wanted to go, insuring his privacy was her top priority. She was not to pry into his business or allow anyone else to do so.\n Rush hour traffic delayed them a long time. At first, Avery concentrated on putting as much distance as she could between the bus and Washington. It was past ten by the time she turned off the main roads. She activated the GPS to try and find a route, but all the screen showed was snow. She tried her phone, and the result was the same. Not even the radio worked. One of those crates must have contained a jamming device; the bus was a rolling electronic dead zone. She smiled. So much for Henry\u2019s bugs.\n It was quiet and peaceful driving through the night. A nearly full moon rode in the clear autumn sky, and woods closed in around them. Once, when she had first taken up driving in order to escape her memories, she had played a game of heading randomly down roads she had never seen, getting deliberately lost. Now she played it again, not caring where she ended up. She had never been good at keeping to the main roads.\n By 3:00 she was tired, and when she saw the entrance to a state park, she turned and pulled into the empty parking lot. In the quiet after the engine shut off, she walked back through the kitchen and sitting area to see if there were any objections from her passengers. She listened at the closed door, but heard nothing and concluded they were asleep. As she was turning away, the door jerked open and the translator said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n He was still fully dressed, exactly as she had seen him before, except without the glasses, his eyes were a little bloodshot, as if he hadn\u2019t closed them. \u201cI\u2019ve pulled over to get some sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to keep driving without rest.\u201d\n \u201cOh. All right,\u201d he said, and closed the door.\n Shrugging, she went forward. There was a fold-down bunk that had once served the previous owner\u2019s entourage, and she now prepared to use it. She brushed her teeth in the tiny bathroom, pulled a sleeping bag from her backpack, and settled in.\n Morning sun woke her. When she opened her eyes, it was flooding in the windows. At the kitchen table a yard away from her, the translator was sitting, staring out the window. By daylight, she saw that he had a square face the color of teak and closely trimmed black beard. She guessed that he might be Latino, and in his twenties.\n \u201cMorning,\u201d she said. He turned to stare at her, but said nothing. Not practiced in social graces, she thought. \u201cI\u2019m Avery,\u201d she said.\n Still he didn\u2019t reply. \u201cIt\u2019s customary to tell me your name now,\u201d she said.\n \u201cOh. Lionel,\u201d he answered.\n \u201cPleased to meet you.\u201d\n He said nothing, so she got up and went into the bathroom. When she came out, he was still staring fixedly out the window. She started making coffee. \u201cWant some?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cCoffee.\u201d\n \u201cI ought to try it,\u201d he said reluctantly.\n \u201cWell, don\u2019t let me force you,\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d He was studying her, apprehensive.\n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I was being sarcastic. Like a joke. Never mind.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n He got up restlessly and started opening the cupboards. Frank had stocked them with all the necessities, even a few luxuries. But Lionel didn\u2019t seem to find what he was looking for.\n \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Avery guessed.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n Avery searched for another way to word the question. \u201cWould you like me to fix you some breakfast?\u201d\n He looked utterly stumped.\n \u201cNever mind. Just sit down and I\u2019ll make you something.\u201d\n He sat down, gripping the edge of the table tensely. \u201cThat\u2019s a tree,\u201d he said, looking out the window.\n \u201cRight. It\u2019s a whole lot of trees.\u201d\n \u201cI ought to go out.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t make the mistake of joking again. It was like talking to a person raised by wolves. Or aliens.\n When she set a plate of eggs and bacon down in front of him, he sniffed it suspiciously. \u201cThat\u2019s food?\u201d\n \u201cYes, it\u2019s good. Try it.\u201d\n He watched her eat for a few moments, then gingerly tried a bite of scrambled eggs. His expression showed distaste, but he resolutely forced himself to swallow. But when he tried the bacon, he couldn\u2019t bear it. \u201cIt bit my mouth,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re probably not used to the salt. What do you normally eat?\u201d\n He reached in a pocket and took out some brown pellets that looked like dog kibble. Avery made a face of disgust. \u201cWhat is that, people chow?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly adapted to our nutritional needs,\u201d Lionel said. \u201cTry it.\u201d\n She was about to say \u201cno thanks,\u201d but he was clearly making an effort to try new things, so she took a pellet and popped it in her mouth. It wasn\u2019t terrible\u2014chewy rather than crunchy\u2014but tasteless. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stick to our food,\u201d she said.\n He looked gloomy. \u201cI need to learn to eat yours.\u201d\n \u201cWhy? Research?\u201d\n He nodded. \u201cI have to find out how the feral humans live.\u201d\n So, Avery reflected, she was dealing with someone raised as a pet, who was now being released into the wild. For whatever reason.\n \u201cSo where do you want to go today?\u201d Avery said, sipping coffee.\n He gave an indifferent gesture.\n \u201cYou\u2019re heading for St. Louis?\u201d\n \u201cOh, I just picked that name off a map. It seemed to be in the center.\u201d\n \u201cThat it is.\u201d She had lived there once; it was so incorrigibly in the center there was no edge to it. \u201cDo you want to go by any particular route?\u201d\n He shrugged.\n \u201cHow much time do you have?\u201d\n \u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d\n \u201cOkay. The scenic route, then.\u201d\n She got up to clean the dishes, telling Lionel that this was a good time for him to go out, if he wanted to. It took him a while to summon his resolve. She watched out the kitchen window as he approached a tree as if to have a conversation with it. He felt its bark, smelled its leaves, and returned unhappy and distracted.\n Avery followed the same random-choice method of navigation as the previous night, but always trending west. Soon they came to the first ridge of mountains. People from western states talked as if the Appalachians weren\u2019t real mountains, but they were\u2014rugged and impenetrable ridges like walls erected to bar people from the land of milk and honey. In the mountains, all the roads ran northeast and southwest through the valleys between the crumpled land, with only the brave roads daring to climb up and pierce the ranges. The autumn leaves were at their height, russet and gold against the brilliant sky. All day long Lionel sat staring out the window.\n That night she found a half-deserted campground outside a small town. She refilled the water tanks, hooked up the electricity, then came back in. \u201cYou\u2019re all set,\u201d she told Lionel. \u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, I\u2019m heading into town.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d he said.\n It felt good to stretch her legs walking along the highway shoulder. The air was chill but bracing. The town was a tired, half abandoned place, but she found a bar and settled down with a beer and a burger. She couldn\u2019t help watching the patrons around her\u2014worn-down, elderly people just managing to hang on. What would an alien think of America if she brought him here?\n Remembering that she was away from the interference field, she thumbed on her phone\u2014and immediately realized that the ping would give away her location to the spooks. But since she\u2019d already done it, she dialed her brother\u2019s number and left a voicemail congratulating him on the concert she was missing. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine with me,\u201d she said, then added mischievously, \u201cI met a nice young man named Henry. I think he\u2019s sweet on me. Bye.\u201d\n Heading back through the night, she became aware that someone was following her. The highway was too dark to see who it was, but when she stopped, the footsteps behind her stopped, too. At last a car passed, and she wheeled around to see what the headlights showed.\n \u201cLionel!\u201d she shouted. He didn\u2019t answer, just stood there, so she walked back toward him. \u201cDid you follow me?\u201d\n He was standing with hands in pockets, hunched against the cold. Defensively, he said, \u201cI wanted to see what you would do when I wasn\u2019t around.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business what I do off duty. Listen, respecting privacy goes both ways. If you want me to respect yours, you\u2019ve got to respect mine, okay?\u201d\n He looked cold and miserable, so she said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get back before you freeze solid.\u201d\n They walked side by side in silence, gravel crunching underfoot. At last he said stiffly, \u201cI\u2019d like to re-negotiate our contract.\u201d\n \u201cOh, yeah? What part of the contract?\u201d\n \u201cThe part about privacy. I . . . \u201d He searched for words. \u201cWe should have asked for more than a driver. We need a translator.\u201d\n At least he\u2019d realized it. He might speak perfect English, but he was not fluent in Human.\n \u201cMy contract is with your . . . employer. Is this what he wants?\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n \u201cThe other passenger. I don\u2019t know what to call him. \u2018The alien\u2019 isn\u2019t polite. What\u2019s his name?\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t have names. They don\u2019t have a language.\u201d\n Astonished, Avery said, \u201cThen how do you communicate?\u201d\n He glowered at her. She held up her hands. \u201cSorry. No offense intended. I\u2019m just trying to find out what he wants.\u201d\n \u201cThey don\u2019t want things,\u201d he muttered, gazing fixedly at the moonlit road. \u201cAt least, not like you do. They\u2019re not . . . awake. Aware. Not like people are.\u201d\n This made so little sense to Avery, she wondered if he were having trouble with the language. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou mean they\u2019re not . . . sentient?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re not conscious,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n \u201cBut they have technology. They built those domes, or brought them here, or whatever the hell they did. They have an advanced civilization.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t say they aren\u2019t smart. They\u2019re smarter than people are. They\u2019re just not conscious.\u201d\n Avery shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t imagine it.\u201d\n \u201cYes, you can,\u201d Lionel said impatiently. \u201cPeople function unconsciously all the time. You\u2019re not aware that you\u2019re keeping your balance right now\u2014you just do it automatically. You don\u2019t have to be aware to walk, or breathe. In fact, the more skillful you are at something, the less aware you are. Being aware would just degrade their skill.\u201d\n They had come to the campground entrance. Behind the dark pine trees, Avery could see the bus, holding its unknowable passenger. For a moment the bus seemed to stare back with blank eyes. She made herself focus on the practical. \u201cSo how can I know what he wants?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n She refrained from asking, \u201cAnd how do you know?\u201d because he\u2019d already refused to answer that. The new privacy rules were to be selective, then. But she already knew more about the aliens than anyone else on Earth, except the translators. Not that she understood.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t keep calling him \u2018him,\u2019 or \u2018the alien,\u2019\u201d Avery said the next morning over breakfast. \u201cI have to give him a name. I\u2019m going to call him \u2018Mr. Burbage.\u2019 If he doesn\u2019t know, he won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n Lionel didn\u2019t look any more disturbed than usual. She took that as consent.\n \u201cSo where are we going today?\u201d she asked.\n He pressed his lips together in concentration. \u201cI need to go to a place where I can acquire knowledge.\u201d\n Since this could encompass anything from a brothel to a university, Avery said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be more specific. What kind of knowledge?\u201d\n \u201cKnowledge about you.\u201d\n \u201cMe?\u201d\n \u201cNo, you humans. How you work.\u201d\n Humans. For that, she would have to find a bigger town.\n As she cruised down a county road, Avery thought about Blake. Once, he had told her that to play an instrument truly well, you had to lose all awareness of what you were doing, and rely entirely on the muscle memory in your fingers. \u201cYou are so in the present, there is no room for self,\u201d Blake said. \u201cNo ego, no doubt, no introspection.\u201d\n She envied him the ability to achieve such a state. She had tried to play the saxophone, but had never gotten good enough to experience what Blake described. Only playing video games could she concentrate intensely enough to lose self-awareness. It was strange, how addictive it was to escape the prison of her skull and forget she had a self. Mystics and meditators strove to achieve such a state.\n A motion in the corner of her eye made her slam on the brakes and swerve. A startled deer pirouetted, flipped its tail, and leaped away. She continued on more slowly, searching for a sign to see where she was. She could not remember having driven the last miles, or whether she had passed any turns. Smiling grimly, she realized that driving was her skill, something she knew so well that she could do it unconsciously. She had even reacted to a threat before knowing what it was. Her reflexes were faster than her conscious mind.\n Were the aliens like that all the time? In a perpetual state of flow, like virtuoso musicians or Zen monks in samadhi? What would be the point of achieving such supreme skill, if the price was never knowing it was you doing it?\n Around noon, they came to a town nestled in a steep valley on a rushing river. Driving down the main street, she spied a quaint, cupolaed building with a \u201cMunicipal Library\u201d sign out front. Farther on, at the edge of town, an abandoned car lot offered a grass-pocked parking lot, so she turned in. \u201cCome on, Lionel,\u201d she called out. \u201cI\u2019ve found a place for you to acquire knowledge.\u201d\n They walked back into town together. The library was quiet and empty except for an old man reading a magazine. The selection of books was sparse, but there was a row of computers. \u201cYou know how to use these?\u201d Avery said in a low voice.\n \u201cNot this kind,\u201d Lionel said. \u201cThey\u2019re very . . . primitive.\u201d\n They sat down together, and Avery explained how to work the mouse and get on the Internet, how to search and scroll. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can go now.\u201d\n Shrugging, she left him to his research. She strolled down the main street, stopped in a drugstore, then found a caf\u00e9 that offered fried egg sandwiches on Wonder Bread, a luxury from her childhood. With lunch and a cup of coffee, she settled down to wait, sorting email on her phone.\n Some time later, she became aware of the television behind the counter. It was tuned to one of those daytime expos\u00e9 shows hosted by a shrill woman who spoke in a tone of breathless indignation. \u201cComing up,\u201d she said, \u201cSlaves or traitors? Who are these alien translators?\u201d\n Avery realized that some part of her brain must have been listening and alerted her conscious mind to pay attention, just as it had reacted to the deer. She had a threat detection system she was not even aware of.\n In the story that followed, a correspondent revealed that she had been unable to match any of the translators with missing children recorded in the past twenty years. The host treated this as suspicious information that someone ought to be looking into. Then came a panel of experts to discuss what they knew of the translators, which was nothing.\n \u201cTurncoats,\u201d commented one of the men at the counter watching the show. \u201cWhy would anyone betray his own race?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re not even human,\u201d said another, \u201cjust made to look that way. They\u2019re clones or robots or something.\u201d\n \u201cThe government won\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re just letting those aliens sit there.\u201d\n Avery got up to pay her bill. The woman at the cash register said, \u201cYou connected with that big tour bus parked out at Fenniman\u2019s?\u201d\n She had forgotten that in a town like this, everyone knew instantly what was out of the ordinary.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Avery said. \u201cMe and my . . . boyfriend are delivering it to a new owner.\u201d\n She glanced up at the television just as a collage of faces appeared. Lionel\u2019s was in the top row. \u201cLook closely,\u201d the show\u2019s host said. \u201cIf you recognize any of these faces, call us at 1-800- . . . \u201d Avery didn\u2019t wait to hear the number. The door shut behind her.\n It was hard not to walk quickly enough to attract attention. Why had she left him alone, as if it were safe? Briefly, she thought of bringing the bus in to pick him up at the library, but it would only attract more attention. The sensible thing was to slip inconspicuously out of town.\n Lionel was engrossed in a website about the brain when she came in. She sat down next to him and said quietly, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to leave.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not . . . \u201d\n \u201cLionel. We have to leave. Right now.\u201d\n He frowned, but got the message. As he rose to put on his coat, she quickly erased his browser history and cache. Then she led the way out and around the building to a back street where there were fewer eyes. \u201cHold my hand,\u201d she said.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n \u201cI told them you were my boyfriend. We\u2019ve got to act friendly.\u201d\n He didn\u2019t object or ask what was going on. The aliens had trained him well, she thought.\n The street they were on came to an end, and they were forced back onto the main thoroughfare, right past the caf\u00e9. In Avery\u2019s mind every window was a pair of eyes staring at the strangers. As they left the business section of town and the buildings thinned out, she became aware of someone walking a block behind them. Glancing back, she saw a man in hunter\u2019s camouflage and billed cap, carrying a gun case on a strap over one shoulder.\n She sped up, but the man trailing them sped up as well. When they were in sight of the bus, Avery pressed the keys into Lionel\u2019s hand and said, \u201cGo on ahead. I\u2019ll stall this guy. Get inside and don\u2019t open the door to anyone but me.\u201d Then she turned back to confront their pursuer.\n Familiarity tickled as he drew closer. When she was sure, she called out, \u201cAfternoon, Henry! What a coincidence to see you here.\u201d\n \u201cHello, Avery,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t look quite right in the hunter costume: he was too urban and fit. \u201cThat was pretty careless of you. I followed to make sure you got back safe.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t know his picture was all over the TV,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been out of touch.\u201d\n \u201cI know, we lost track of you for a while there. Please don\u2019t do that again.\u201d\n As threats went, Henry now seemed like the lesser evil. She hesitated, then said, \u201cI didn\u2019t see any need to get in touch.\u201d That meant the country was not in peril.\n \u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cListen, if you turn left on Highway 19 ahead, you\u2019ll come to a national park with a campground. It\u2019ll be safe.\u201d\n As she walked back to the bus, she was composing a lie about who she had been talking to. But Lionel never asked. As soon as she was on board he started eagerly telling her about what he had learned in the library. She had never seen him so animated, so she gestured him to sit in the passenger seat beside her while she got the bus moving again.\n \u201cThe reason you\u2019re conscious is because of the cerebral cortex,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an add-on, the last part of the brain to evolve. Its only purpose is to monitor what the rest of the brain is doing. All the sensory input goes to the inner brain first, and gets processed, so the cortex never gets the raw data. It only sees the effect on the rest of the brain, not what\u2019s really out there. That\u2019s why you\u2019re aware of yourself. In fact, it\u2019s all you\u2019re aware of.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are you saying \u2018you\u2019?\u201d Avery asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a cerebral cortex, too.\u201d\n Defensively, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not like you.\u201d\n Avery shrugged. \u201cOkay.\u201d But she wanted to keep the conversation going. \u201cSo Mr. Burbage doesn\u2019t have a cortex? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Lionel said. \u201cFor him, life is a skill of the autonomic nervous system, not something he had to consciously learn. That\u2019s why he can think and react faster than we can, and requires less energy. The messages don\u2019t have to travel on a useless detour through the cortex.\u201d\n \u201cUseless?\u201d Avery objected. \u201cI kind of like being conscious.\u201d\n Lionel fell silent, suddenly grave and troubled.\n She glanced over at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n In a low tone he said, \u201cHe likes being conscious, too. It\u2019s what they want from us.\u201d\n Avery gripped the wheel and tried not to react. Up to now, the translators had denied that the aliens wanted anything at all from humans. But then it occurred to her that Lionel might not mean humans when he said \u201cus.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean, you translators?\u201d she ventured.\n He nodded, looking grim.\n \u201cIs that a bad thing?\u201d she asked, reacting to his expression.\n \u201cNot for us,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for them. It\u2019s killing him.\u201d\n He was struggling with some strong emotion. Guilt, she thought. Maybe grief.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.\n Angrily, he stood up to head back into the bus. \u201cWhy do you make me think of this?\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just mind your own business?\u201d\n Avery drove on, listening as he slammed the bedroom door behind him. She didn\u2019t feel any resentment. She knew all about guilt and grief, and how useless they made you feel. Lionel\u2019s behavior made more sense to her now. He was having trouble distinguishing between what was happening to him externally and what was coming from inside. Even people skilled at being human had trouble with that.\n The national park Henry had recommended turned out to be at Cumberland Gap, the mountain pass early pioneers had used to migrate west to Kentucky. They spent the night in the campground undisturbed. At dawn, Avery strolled out in the damp morning air to look around. She quickly returned to say, \u201cLionel, come out here. You need to see this.\u201d\n She led him across the road to an overlook facing west. From the edge of the Appalachians they looked out on range after range of wooded foothills swaddled in fog. The morning sun at their backs lit everything in shades of mauve and azure. Avery felt like Daniel Boone looking out on the Promised Land, stretching before her into the misty distance, unpolluted by the past.\n \u201cI find this pleasant,\u201d Lionel said gravely.\n Avery smiled. It was a breakthrough statement for someone so unaccustomed to introspection that he hadn\u2019t been able to tell her he was hungry two days ago. But all she said was, \u201cMe, too.\u201d\n After several moments of silence, she ventured, \u201cDon\u2019t you think Mr. Burbage would enjoy seeing this? There\u2019s no one else around. Doesn\u2019t he want to get out of the bus some time?\u201d\n \u201cHe is seeing it,\u201d Lionel said.\n \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cHe is here.\u201d Lionel tapped his head with a finger.\n Avery couldn\u2019t help staring. \u201cYou mean you have some sort of telepathic connection with him?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as telepathy,\u201d Lionel said dismissively. \u201cThey communicate with neurotransmitters.\u201d She was still waiting, so he said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to be all in one place. Part of him is with me, part of him is in the bus.\u201d\n \u201cIn your head?\u201d she asked, trying not to betray how creepy she found this news.\n He nodded. \u201cHe needs me to observe the world for him, and understand it. They have had lots of other helper species to do things for them\u2014species that build things, or transport them. But we\u2019re the first one with advanced consciousness.\u201d\n \u201cAnd that\u2019s why they\u2019re interested in us.\u201d\n Lionel looked away to avoid her eyes, but nodded. \u201cThey like it,\u201d he said, his voice low and reluctant. \u201cAt first it was just novel and new for them, but now it\u2019s become an addiction, like a dangerous drug. We pay a high metabolic price for consciousness; it\u2019s why our lifespan is so short. They live for centuries. But when they get hooked on us, they burn out even faster than we do.\u201d\n He picked up a rock and flung it over the cliff, watching as it arced up, then plummeted.\n \u201cAnd if he dies, what happens to you?\u201d Avery asked.\n \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die,\u201d Lionel said. He put his hands in his pockets and studied his feet. \u201cIt feels . . . good to have him around. I like his company. He\u2019s very old, very wise.\u201d\n For a moment, she could see it through his eyes. She could imagine feeling intimately connected to an ancient being who was dying from an inability to part with his adopted human son. What a terrible burden for Lionel to carry, to be slowly killing someone he loved.\n And yet, she still felt uneasy.\n \u201cHow do you know?\u201d she asked.\n He looked confused. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n \u201cYou said he\u2019s old and wise. How do you know that?\u201d\n \u201cThe way you know anything unconscious. It\u2019s a feeling, an instinct.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure he not controlling you? Pushing around your neurotransmitters?\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said, mildly irritated. \u201cI told you, he\u2019s not conscious, at least not naturally. Control is a conscious thing.\u201d\n \u201cBut what if you did something he didn\u2019t want?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t feel like doing things he doesn\u2019t want. Like talking to you now. He must have decided he can trust you, because I wouldn\u2019t feel like telling you anything if he hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n Avery wasn\u2019t sure whether being trusted by an alien was something she aspired to. But she did want Lionel to trust her, and so she let the subject drop.\n \u201cWhere do you want to go today?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cYou keep asking me that.\u201d He stared out on the landscape, as if waiting for a revelation. At last he said, \u201cI want to see humans living as they normally do. We\u2019ve barely seen any of them. I didn\u2019t think the planet was so sparsely populated.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make a phone call for that.\u201d\n When he had returned to the bus, she strolled away, took out Henry\u2019s card, and thumbed the number. Despite the early hour, he answered on the first ring.\n \u201cHe wants to see humans,\u201d she said. \u201cNormal humans behaving normally. Can you help me out?\u201d\n \u201cLet me make some calls,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll text you instructions.\u201d\n \u201cNo men in black,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what I mean?\u201d\n \u201cI get it.\u201d\n When Avery stopped for diesel around noon, the gas station television was blaring with news that the Justice Department would investigate the aliens for abducting human children. She escaped into the restroom to check her phone. The internet was ablaze with speculation: who the translators were, whether they could be freed, whether they were human at all. The part of the government that had approved Lionel\u2019s road trip was clearly working at cross purposes with the part that had dreamed up this new strategy for extracting information from the aliens. The only good news was that no hint had leaked out that an alien was roaming the back roads of America in a converted bus.\n Henry had texted her a cryptic suggestion to head toward Paris. She had to Google it to find that there actually was a Paris, Kentucky. When she came out to pay for the fuel, she was relieved to see that the television had moved on to World Series coverage. On impulse, she bought a Cardinals cap for Lionel.\n Paris turned out to be a quaint old Kentucky town that had once had delusions of cityhood. Today, a county fair was the main event in town. The RV park was almost full, but Avery\u2019s E.T. Express managed to maneuver in. When everything was settled, she sat on the bus steps sipping a Bud and waiting for night so they could venture out with a little more anonymity. The only thing watching her was a skittish, half-wild cat crouched behind a trashcan. Somehow, it reminded her of Lionel, so she tossed it a Cheeto to see if she could lure it out. It refused the bait.\n That night, disguised by the dark and a Cardinals cap, Lionel looked tolerably inconspicuous. As they were leaving to take in the fair, she said, \u201cWill Mr. Burbage be okay while we\u2019re gone? What if someone tries to break into the bus?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Lionel said. His tone implied more than his words. She resolved to call Henry at the earliest opportunity and pass along a warning not to try anything.\n The people in the midway all looked authentic. If there were snipers on the bigtop and agents on the merry-go-round, she couldn\u2019t tell. When people failed to recognize Lionel at the ticket stand and popcorn wagon, she began to relax. Everyone was here to enjoy themselves, not to look for aliens.\n She introduced Lionel to the joys of corn dogs and cotton candy, to the Ferris wheel and tilt-a-whirl. He took in the jangling sounds, the smells of deep-fried food, and the blinking lights with a grave and studious air. When they had had their fill of all the machines meant to disorient and confuse, they took a break at a picnic table, sipping Cokes.\n Avery said, \u201cIs Mr. Burbage enjoying this?\u201d\n Lionel shrugged. \u201cAre you?\u201d He wasn\u2019t deflecting her question; he actually wanted to know.\n She considered. \u201cI think people enjoy these events mainly because they bring back childhood memories,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes. It does seem familiar,\u201d Lionel said.\n \u201cReally? What about it?\u201d\n He paused, searching his mind. \u201cThe smells,\u201d he said at last.\n Avery nodded. It was smells for her, as well: deep fat fryers, popcorn. \u201cDo you remember anything from the time before you were abducted?\u201d\n \u201cAdopted,\u201d he corrected her.\n \u201cRight, adopted. What about your family?\u201d\n He shook his head.\n \u201cDo you ever wonder what kind of people they were?\u201d\n \u201cThe kind of people who wouldn\u2019t look for me,\u201d he said coldly.\n \u201cWait a minute. You don\u2019t know that. For all you know, your mother might have cried her eyes out when you disappeared.\u201d\n He stared at her. She realized she had spoken with more emotion than she had intended. The subject had touched a nerve. \u201cSorry,\u201d she muttered, and got up. \u201cI\u2019m tired. Can we head back?\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d he said, and followed her without question.\n That night she couldn\u2019t sleep. She lay watching the pattern from the lights outside on the ceiling, but her mind was on the back of the bus. Up to now she had slept without thinking of the strangeness just beyond the door, but tonight it bothered her.\n About 3:00 AM she roused from a doze at the sound of Lionel\u2019s quiet footstep going past her. She lay silent as he eased the bus door open. When he had gone outside she rose and looked to see what he was doing. He walked away from the bus toward a maintenance shed and some dumpsters. She debated whether to follow him; it was just what she had scolded him for doing to her. But concern for his safety won out, and she took a flashlight from the driver\u2019s console, put it in the pocket of a windbreaker, and followed.\n At first she thought she had lost him. The parking lot was motionless and quiet. A slight breeze stirred the pines on the edge of the road. Then she heard a scuffling sound ahead, a thump, and a soft crack. At first she stood listening, but when there was no more sound, she crept forward. Rounding the dumpster, she saw in its shadow a figure crouched on the ground. Unable to make out what was going on, she switched on the flashlight.\n Lionel turned, his eyes wild and hostile. Dangling from his hand was the limp body of a cat, its head ripped off. His face was smeared with its blood. Watching her, he deliberately ripped a bite of cat meat from the body with his teeth and swallowed.\n \u201cLionel!\u201d she cried out in horror. \u201cPut that down!\u201d\n He turned away, trying to hide his prey like an animal. Without thinking, she grabbed his arm, and he spun fiercely around, as if to fight her. His eyes looked utterly alien. She stepped back. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Avery,\u201d she said.\n He looked down at the mangled carcass in his hand, then dropped it, rose, and backed away. Once again taking his arm, Avery guided him away from the dumpsters, back to the bus. Inside, she led him to the kitchen sink. \u201cWash,\u201d she ordered, then went to firmly close the bus door.\n Her heart was pounding, and she kept the heavy flashlight in her hand for security. But when she came back, she saw he was trembling so hard he had dropped the soap and was leaning against the sink for support. Seeing that his face was still smeared with blood, she took a paper towel and wiped him off, then dried his hands. He sank onto the bench by the kitchen table. She stood watching him, arms crossed, waiting for him to speak. He didn\u2019t.\n \u201cSo what was that about?\u201d she said sternly.\n He shook his head.\n \u201cCats aren\u2019t food,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re living beings.\u201d\n Still he didn\u2019t speak.\n \u201cHave you been sneaking out at night all along?\u201d she demanded.\n He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know . . . I just thought . . . I wanted to see what it would feel like.\u201d\n \u201cYou mean Mr. Burbage wanted to see what it would feel like,\u201d she said.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d he admitted.\n \u201cWell, people don\u2019t do things like that.\u201d\n He was looking ill. She grabbed his arm and hustled him into the bathroom, aiming him at the toilet. She left him there vomiting, and started shoving belongings into her backpack. As she swung it onto her shoulder, he staggered to the bathroom door.\n \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep here, knowing you do things like that.\u201d\n He looked dumbstruck. She pushed past him and out the door. She was striding away across the gravel parking lot when he called after her, \u201cAvery! You can\u2019t leave.\u201d\n She wheeled around. \u201cCan\u2019t I? Just watch me.\u201d\n He left the bus and followed her. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said.\n \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\n \u201cWho\u2019s talking, you or him?\u201d\n A light went on in the RV next to them. She realized they were making a late-night scene like trailer-park trash, attracting attention. This wasn\u2019t an argument they could have in public. And now that she was out here, she realized she had no place to go. So she shooed Lionel back toward the bus.\n Once inside, she said, \u201cThis is the thing, Lionel. This whole situation is creeping me out. You can\u2019t make any promises as long as he\u2019s in charge. Maybe next time he\u2019ll want to see what it feels like to kill me in my sleep, and you won\u2019t be able to stop him.\u201d\n Lionel looked disturbed. \u201cHe won\u2019t do that.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n \u201cI just . . . do.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not good enough. I need to see him.\u201d\n Avery wasn\u2019t sure why she had blurted it out, except that living with an invisible, ever-present passenger had become intolerable. As long as she didn\u2019t know what the door in the back of the bus concealed, she couldn\u2019t be at ease.\n He shook his head. \u201cThat won\u2019t help.\u201d\n She crossed her arms and said, \u201cI can\u2019t stay unless I know what he is.\u201d\n Lionel\u2019s face took on an introspective look, as if he were consulting his conscience. At last he said, \u201cYou\u2019d have to promise not to tell anyone.\u201d\n Avery hadn\u2019t really expected him to consent, and now felt a nervous tremor. She dropped her pack on the bed and gripped her hands into fists. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n He led the way to the back of the bus and eased the door open as if fearing to disturb the occupant within. She followed him in. The small room was dimly lit and there was an earthy smell. All the crates he had brought in must have been folded up and put away, because none were visible. There was an unmade bed, and beside it a clear box like an aquarium tank, holding something she could not quite make out. When Lionel turned on a light, she saw what the tank contained.\n It looked most like a coral or sponge\u2014a yellowish, rounded growth the size of half a beach ball, resting on a bed of wood chips and dead leaves. Lionel picked up a spray bottle and misted it tenderly. It responded by expanding as if breathing.\n \u201cThat\u2019s Mr. Burbage?\u201d Avery whispered.\n Lionel nodded. \u201cPart of him. The most important part.\u201d\n The alien seemed insignificant, something she could destroy with a bottle of bleach. \u201cCan he move?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cOh, yes,\u201d Lionel said. \u201cNot the way we do.\u201d\n She waited for him to explain. At first he seemed reluctant, but he finally said, \u201cThey are colonies of cells with a complicated life cycle. This is the final stage of their development, when they become most complex and organized. After this, they dissolve into the earth. The cells don\u2019t die; they go on to form other coalitions. But the individual is lost. Just like us, I suppose.\u201d\n What she was feeling, she realized, was disappointment. In spite of all Lionel had told her, she had hoped there would be some way of communicating. Before, she had not truly believed that the alien could be insentient. Now she did. In fact, she found it hard to believe that it could think at all.\n \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s intelligent?\u201d she asked. \u201cHe could be just a heap of chemicals, like a loaf of bread rising.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m intelligent?\u201d he said, staring at the tank. \u201cOr anyone?\u201d\n \u201cYou react to me. You communicate. He can\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cYes, he can.\u201d\n \u201cHow? If I touched him\u2014\u201c\n \u201cNo!\u201d Lionel said quickly. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him. You\u2019d see, he would react. It wouldn\u2019t be malice, just a reflex.\u201d\n \u201cThen how do you . . . ?\u201d\n Reluctantly, Lionel said, \u201cHe has to touch you. It\u2019s the only way to exchange neurotransmitters.\u201d He paused, as if debating something internally. She watched the conflict play across his face. At last, reluctantly, he said, \u201cI think he would be willing to communicate with you.\u201d\n It was what she had wanted, some reassurance of the alien\u2019s intentions. But now it was offered, her instincts were unwilling. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d she said.\n Lionel looked relieved. She realized he hadn\u2019t wanted to give up his unique relationship with Mr. Burbage.\n \u201cThanks anyway,\u201d she said, for the generosity of the offer he hadn\u2019t wanted to make.\n And yet, it left her unsure. She had only Lionel\u2019s word that the alien was friendly. After tonight, that wasn\u2019t enough.\n Neither of them could sleep, so as soon as day came they set out again. Heading west, Avery knew they were going deeper and deeper into isolationist territory, where even human strangers were unwelcome, never mind aliens. This was the land where she had grown up, and she knew it well. From here, the world outside looked like a violent, threatening place full of impoverished hordes who envied and hated the good life in America. Here, even the churches preached self-satisfaction, and discontent was the fault of those who hated freedom\u2014like college professors, homosexuals, and immigrants.\n Growing up, she had expected to spend her life in this country. She had done everything right\u2014married just out of high school, worked as a waitress, gotten pregnant at 19. Her life had been mapped out in front of her.\n She couldn\u2019t even imagine it now.\n This morning, Lionel seemed to want to talk. He sat beside her in the co-pilot seat, watching the road and answering her questions.\n \u201cWhat does it feel like, when he communicates with you?\u201d\n He reflected. \u201cIt feels like a mood, or a hunch. Or I act on impulse.\u201d\n \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s him, and not your own subconscious?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n Avery shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to go through life acting on hunches.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n \u201cYour unconscious . . . it\u2019s unreliable. You can\u2019t control it. It can lead you wrong.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not some outside entity; it\u2019s you. It\u2019s your conscious mind that\u2019s the slave master, always worrying about control. Your unconscious only wants to preserve you.\u201d\n \u201cNot if there\u2019s an alien messing around with it.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s not like that. This drive to dominate\u2014that\u2019s a conscious thing. He doesn\u2019t have that slave master part of the brain.\u201d\n \u201cDo you know that for a fact, or are you just guessing?\u201d\n \u201cGuessing is what your unconscious tells you. Knowing is a conscious thing. They\u2019re only in conflict if your mind is fighting itself.\u201d\n \u201cSounds like the human condition to me,\u201d Avery said. This had to be the weirdest conversation in her life.\n \u201cIs he here now?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cOf course he is.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t you ever want to get away from him?\u201d\n Puzzled, he said, \u201cWhy should I?\u201d\n \u201cPrivacy. To be by yourself.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to be by myself.\u201d\n Something in his voice told her he was thinking ahead, to the death of his lifelong companion. Abruptly, he rose and walked back into the bus.\n Actually, she had lied to him. She had gone through life acting on hunches. Go with your gut had been her motto, because she had trusted her gut. But of course it had nothing to do with gut, or heart\u2014it was her unconscious mind she had been following. Her unconscious was why she took this road rather than that, or preferred Raisin Bran to Corn Flakes. It was why she found certain tunes achingly beautiful, and why she was fond of this strange young man, against all rational evidence.\n As the road led them nearer to southern Illinois, Avery found memories surfacing. They came with a tug of regret, like a choking rope pulling her back toward the person she hadn\u2019t become. She thought of the cascade of non-decisions that had led her to become the rootless, disconnected person she was, as much a stranger to the human race as Lionel was, in her way.\n What good has consciousness ever done me? she thought. It only made her aware that she could never truly connect with another human being, deep down. And on that day when her cells would dissolve into the soil, there would be no trace her consciousness had ever existed.\n That night they camped at a freeway rest stop a day\u2019s drive from St. Louis. Lionel was moody and anxious. Avery\u2019s attempt to interest him in a trashy novel was fruitless. At last she asked what was wrong. Fighting to find the words, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s very ill. This trip was a bad idea. All the stimulation has made him worse.\u201d\n Tentatively, she said, \u201cShould we head for one of the domes?\u201d\n Lionel shook his head. \u201cThey can\u2019t cure this . . . this addiction to consciousness. If they could, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take it.\u201d\n \u201cDo the others\u2014his own people\u2014know what\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\n Lionel nodded wordlessly.\n She didn\u2019t know what comfort to offer. \u201cWell,\u201d she said at last, \u201cit was his choice to come.\u201d\n \u201cA selfish choice,\u201d Lionel said angrily.\n She couldn\u2019t help noticing that he was speaking for himself, Lionel, as distinct from Mr. Burbage. Thoughtfully, she said, \u201cMaybe they can\u2019t love us as much as we can love them.\u201d\n He looked at her as if the word \u201clove\u201d had never entered his vocabulary. \u201cDon\u2019t say us,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not one of you.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t believe it for a second, but she just said, \u201cSuit yourself,\u201d and turned back to her novel. After a few moments, he went into the back of the bus and closed the door.\n She lay there trying to read for a while, but the story couldn\u2019t hold her attention. She kept listening for some sound from beyond the door, some indication of how they were doing. At last she got up quietly and went to listen. Hearing nothing, she tried the door and found it unlocked. Softly, she cracked it open to look inside.\n Lionel was not asleep. He was lying on the bed, his head next to the alien\u2019s tank. But the alien was no longer in the tank; it was on the pillow. It had extruded a mass of long, cordlike tentacles that gripped Lionel\u2019s head in a medusa embrace, snaking into every opening. One had entered an ear, another a nostril. A third had nudged aside an eyeball in order to enter the eye socket. Fluid coursed along the translucent vessels connecting man and creature.\n Avery wavered on the edge of horror. Her first instinct was to intervene, to defend Lionel from what looked like an attack. But the expression on his face was not of terror, but peace. All his vague references to exchanging neurotransmitters came back to her now: this was what he had meant. The alien communicated by drinking cerebrospinal fluid, its drug of choice, and injecting its own.\n Shaken, she eased the door shut again. Unable to get the image out of her mind, she went outside to walk around the bus to calm her nerves. After three circuits she leaned back against the cold metal, wishing she had a cigarette for the first time in years. Above her, the stars were cold and bright. What was this relationship she had landed in the middle of\u2014predator and prey? father and son? pusher and addict? master and slave? Or some strange combination of all? Had she just witnessed an alien learning about love?\n She had been saving a bottle of bourbon for special occasions, so she went in to pour herself a shot.\n To her surprise, Lionel emerged before she was quite drunk. She thought of offering him a glass, but wasn\u2019t sure how it would mix with whatever was already in his brain.\n He sat down across from her, but just stared silently at the floor for a long time. At last he stirred and said, \u201cI think we ought to take him to a private place.\u201d\n \u201cWhat sort of private place?\u201d Avery asked.\n \u201cSomewhere dignified. Natural. Secluded.\u201d\n To die, she realized. The alien wanted to die in private. Or Lionel wanted him to. There was no telling where one left off and the other began.\n \u201cI know a place,\u201d she said. \u201cWill he make it another day?\u201d\n Lionel nodded silently.\n Through the bourbon haze, Avery wondered what she ought to say to Henry. Was the country in danger? She didn\u2019t think so. This seemed like a personal matter. To be sure, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re certain his relatives won\u2019t blame us if he dies?\u201d\n \u201cBlame?\u201d he said.\n That was conscious-talk, she realized. \u201cReact when he doesn\u2019t come back?\u201d\n \u201cIf they were going to react, they would have done it when he left. They aren\u2019t expecting anything, not even his return. They don\u2019t live in an imaginary future like you people do.\u201d\n \u201cWise of them,\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n They rolled into St. Louis in late afternoon, across the Poplar Street Bridge next to the Arch and off onto I-70 toward the north part of town. Avery knew exactly where she was going. From the first moment Frank had told her the destination was St. Louis, she had known she would end up driving this way, toward the place where she had left the first part of her life.\n Bellefontaine Cemetery lay on what had been the outskirts of the city in Victorian times, several hundred acres of greenery behind a stone wall and a wrought-iron gate. It was a relic from a time when cemeteries were landscaped, parklike sanctuaries from the city. Huge old oak and sweetgum trees lined the winding roadways, their branches now black against the sky. Avery drove slowly past the marble mausoleums and toward the hill at the back of the cemetery, which looked out over the valley toward the Missouri River. It was everything Lionel had wanted\u2014peaceful, natural, secluded.\n Some light rain misted down out of the overcast sky. Avery parked the bus and went out to check whether they were alone. She had seen no one but a single dog-walker near the entrance, and no vehicle had followed them in. The gates would close in half an hour, and the bus would have to be out. Henry and his friends were probably waiting outside the gate for them to appear again. She returned to the bus and knocked on Lionel\u2019s door. He opened it right away. Inside, the large picnic cooler they had bought was standing open, ready.\n \u201cHelp me lift him in,\u201d Lionel said.\n Avery maneuvered past the cooler to the tank. \u201cIs it okay for me to touch him?\u201d\n \u201cHold your hand close to him for a few seconds.\u201d\n Avery did as instructed. A translucent tentacle extruded from the cauliflower folds of the alien\u2019s body. It touched her palm, recoiled, then extended again. Gently, hesitantly, it explored her hand, tickling slightly as it probed her palm and curled around her pinkie. She held perfectly still.\n \u201cWhat is he thinking?\u201d she whispered.\n \u201cHe\u2019s learning your chemical identity,\u201d Lionel said.\n \u201cHow can he learn without being aware? Can he even remember?\u201d\n \u201cOf course he can remember. Your immune system learns and remembers just about every pathogen it ever met, and it\u2019s not aware. Can you remember them all?\u201d\n She shook her head, stymied.\n At last, apparently satisfied, the tendril retracted into the alien\u2019s body.\n \u201cAll right,\u201d Lionel said, \u201cnow you can touch him.\u201d\n The alien was surprisingly heavy. Together, they lifted him onto the bed of dirt and wood chips Lionel had spread in the bottom of the cooler. Lionel fitted the lid on loosely, and each of them took a handle to carry their load out into the open air. Avery led the way around a mausoleum shaped like a Greek temple to an unmowed spot hidden from the path. Sycamore leaves and bark littered the ground, damp from the rain.\n \u201cIs this okay?\u201d she asked.\n For answer, Lionel set down his end of the cooler and straightened, breathing in the forest smell. \u201cThis is okay.\u201d\n \u201cI have to move the bus. Stay behind this building in case anyone comes by. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n The gatekeeper waved as she pulled the bus out onto the street. By the time she had parked it on a nearby residential street and returned, the gate was closed. She walked around the cemetery perimeter to an unfrequented side, then scrambled up the wall and over the spiked fence.\n Inside, the traffic noise of the city fell away. The trees arched overhead in churchlike silence. Not a squirrel stirred. Avery sat down on a tombstone to wait. Beyond the hill, Lionel was holding vigil at the side of his dying companion, and she wanted to give him privacy. The stillness felt good, but unfamiliar. Her life was made of motion. She had been driving for twenty years\u2014driving away, driving beyond, always a new destination. Never back.\n The daylight would soon be gone. She needed to do the other thing she had come here for. Raising the hood of her raincoat, she headed downhill, the grass caressing her sneakers wetly. It was years since she had visited the grave of her daughter Gabrielle, whose short life and death were like a chasm dividing her life into before and after. They had called it crib death then\u2014an unexplained, random, purposeless death. \u201cNothing you could have done,\u201d the doctor had said, thinking that was more comforting than knowing that the universe just didn\u2019t give a damn.\n Gabrielle\u2019s grave lay in a grove of cedar trees\u2014the plot a gift from a sympathetic patron at the caf\u00e9 where Avery had worked. At first she had thought of turning it down because the little grave would be overshadowed by more ostentatious death; but the suburban cemeteries had looked so industrial, monuments stamped out by machine. She had come to love the age and seclusion of this spot. At first, she had visited over and over.\n As she approached in the fading light, she saw that something was lying on the headstone. When she came close she saw that some stranger had placed on the grave a little terra cotta angel with one wing broken. Avery stood staring at the bedraggled figurine, now soaked with rain, a gift to her daughter from someone she didn\u2019t even know. Then, a sudden, unexpected wave of grief doubled her over. It had been twenty years since she had touched her daughter, but the memory was still vivid and tactile. She remembered the smell, the softness of her skin, the utter trust in her eyes. She felt again the aching hole of her absence.\n Avery sank to her knees in the wet grass, sobbing for the child she hadn\u2019t been able to protect, for the sympathy of the nameless stranger, even for the helpless, mutilated angel who would never fly.\n There was a sound behind her, and she looked up. Lionel stood there watching her, rain running down his face\u2014no, it was tears. He wiped his eyes, then looked at his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I feel like this,\u201d he said.\n Poor, muddled man. She got up and hugged him for knowing exactly how she felt. They stood there for a moment, two people trapped in their own brains, and the only crack in the wall was empathy.\n \u201cIs he gone?\u201d she asked softly.\n He shook his head. \u201cNot yet. I left him alone in case it was me . . . interfering. Then I saw you and followed.\u201d\n \u201cThis is my daughter\u2019s grave,\u201d Avery said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I still miss her so much.\u201d\n She took his hand and started back up the hill. They said nothing, but didn\u2019t let go of each other till they got to the marble mausoleum where they had left Mr. Burbage.\n The alien was still there, resting on the ground next to the cooler. Lionel knelt beside him and held out a hand. A bouquet of tentacles reached out and grasped it, then withdrew. Lionel came over to where Avery stood watching. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay with him. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d she said, \u201cif it\u2019s okay with you.\u201d\n He ducked his head furtively.\n So they settled down to keep a strange death watch. Avery shared some chemical hand-warmers she had brought from the bus. When those ran out and night deepened, she managed to find some dry wood at the bottom of a groundskeeper\u2019s brush pile to start a campfire. She sat poking the fire with a stick, feeling drained of tears, worn down as an old tire.\n \u201cDoes he know he\u2019s dying?\u201d she asked.\n Lionel nodded. \u201cI know, and so he knows.\u201d A little bitterly, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s what consciousness does for you.\u201d\n \u201cSo normally he wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d\n He shook his head. \u201cOr care. It\u2019s just part of their life cycle. There\u2019s no death if there\u2019s no self to be aware of it.\u201d\n \u201cNo life either,\u201d Avery said.\n Lionel just sat breaking twigs and tossing them on the fire. \u201cI keep wondering if it was worth it. If consciousness is good enough to die for.\u201d\n She tried to imagine being free of her self\u2014of the regrets of the past and fear of the future. If this were a Star Trek episode, she thought, this would be when Captain Kirk would deliver a speech in defense of being human, despite all the drawbacks. She didn\u2019t feel that way.\n \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cConsciousness kind of sucks.\u201d\n The sky was beginning to glow with dawn when at last they saw a change in the alien. The brainlike mass started to shrink and a liquid pool spread out from under it, as if it were dissolving. There was no sound. At the end, its body deflated like a falling souffl\u00e9, leaving nothing but a slight crust on the leaves and a damp patch on the ground.\n They sat for a long time in silence. It was light when Lionel got up and brushed off his pants, his face set and grim. \u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d he said.\n Avery felt reluctant to leave. \u201cHis cells are in the soil?\u201d she said.\n \u201cYes, they\u2019ll live underground for a while, spreading and multiplying. They\u2019ll go through some blooming and sporing cycles. If any dogs or children come along at that stage, the spores will establish a colony in their brains. It\u2019s how they invade.\u201d\n His voice was perfectly indifferent. Avery stared at him. \u201cYou might have mentioned that.\u201d\n He shrugged.\n An inspiration struck her. She seized up a stick and started digging in the damp patch of ground, scooping up soil in her hands and putting it into the cooler.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Lionel said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop him, it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not trying to,\u201d Avery said. \u201cI want some cells to transplant. I\u2019m going to grow an alien of my own.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s the stupidest\u2014\u02ee\n A moment later he was on his knees beside her, digging and scooping up dirt. They got enough to half-fill the cooler, then covered it with leaves to keep it damp.\n \u201cWait here,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019ll bring the bus to pick you up. The gates open in an hour. Don\u2019t let anyone see you.\u201d\n When she got back to the street where she had left the bus, Henry was waiting in a parked car. He got out and opened the passenger door for her, but she didn\u2019t get inside. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get back,\u201d she said, inclining her head toward the bus. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting for me.\u201d\n \u201cDo you mind telling me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n \u201cI just needed a break. I had to get away.\u201d\n \u201cIn a cemetery? All night?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d\n \u201cIs there something I should know?\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re heading back home today.\u201d\n He waited, but she said no more. There was no use telling him; he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. The invasion was already underway.\n He let her return to the bus, and she drove it to a gas station to fuel up while waiting for the cemetery to open. At the stroke of 8:30 she pulled the bus through the gate, waving at the puzzled gatekeeper.\n Between them, she and Lionel carried the cooler into the bus, leaving behind only the remains of a campfire and a slightly disturbed spot of soil. Then she headed straight for the freeway.\n They stopped for a fast-food breakfast in southern Illinois. Avery kept driving as she ate her egg muffin and coffee. Soon Lionel came to sit shotgun beside her, carrying a plastic container full of soil.\n \u201cIs that mine?\u201d she asked.\n \u201cNo, this one\u2019s mine. You can have the rest.\u201d\n \u201cThanks.\u201d\n \u201cIt won\u2019t be him,\u201d Lionel said, looking at the soil cradled on his lap.\n \u201cNo. But it\u2019ll be yours. Yours to raise and teach.\u201d\n As hers would be.\n \u201cI thought you would have some kind of tribal loyalty to prevent them invading,\u201d Lionel said.\n Avery thought about it a moment, then said, \u201cWe\u2019re not defenseless, you know. We\u2019ve got something they want. The gift of self, of mortality. God, I feel like the snake in the garden. But my alien will love me for it.\u201d She could see the cooler in the rear view mirror, sitting on the floor in the kitchen. Already she felt fond of the person it would become. Gestating inside. \u201cIt gives a new meaning to alien abduction, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d she said.\n He didn\u2019t get the joke. \u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid to become . . . something like me?\u201d\n She looked over at him. \u201cNo one can be like you, Lionel.\u201d\n Even after all this time together, he still didn\u2019t know how to react when she said things like that.\n Carolyn Ives Gilman is currently celebrating her decision to quit her job in order to write more science fiction.

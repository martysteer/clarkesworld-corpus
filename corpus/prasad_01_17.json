Sturgeon Memorial Award\n All known forgeries are tales of failure. The people who get into the newsfeeds for their brilliant attempts to cheat the system with their fraudulent Renaissance masterpieces or their stacks of fake checks, well, they might be successful artists, but they certainly haven\u2019t been successful at forgery.\n The best forgeries are the ones that disappear from notice\u2014a second-rate still-life moldering away in gallery storage, a battered old 50-yuan note at the bottom of a cashier drawer\u2014or even a printed strip of Matsusaka beef, sliding between someone\u2019s parted lips.\n Forging beef is similar to printmaking\u2014every step of the process has to be done with the final print in mind. A red that\u2019s too dark looks putrid, a white that\u2019s too pure looks artificial. All beef is supposed to come from a cow, so stipple the red with dots, flecks, lines of white to fake variance in muscle fiber regions. Cows are similar, but cows aren\u2019t uniform\u2014use fractals to randomize marbling after defining the basic look. Cut the sheets of beef manually to get an authentic ragged edge, don\u2019t get lazy and depend on the bioprinter for that.\n Days of research and calibration and cursing the printer will all vanish into someone\u2019s gullet in seconds, if the job\u2019s done right.\n Helena Li Yuanhui of Splendid Beef Enterprises is an expert in doing the job right.\n The trick is not to get too ambitious. Most forgers are caught out by the smallest errors\u2014a tiny amount of period-inaccurate pigment, a crack in the oil paint that looks too artificial, or a misplaced watermark on a passport. Printing something large increases the chances of a fatal misstep. Stick with small-scale jobs, stick with a small group of regular clients, and in time, Splendid Beef Enterprises will turn enough of a profit for Helena to get a real name change, leave Nanjing, and forget this whole sorry venture ever happened.\n As Helena\u2019s loading the beef into refrigerated boxes for drone delivery, a notification pops up on her iKontakt frames. Helena sighs, turns the volume on her earpiece down, and takes the call.\n \u201cHi, Mr. Chan, could you switch to a secure line? You just need to tap the button with a lock icon, it\u2019s very easy.\u201d\n \u201cNonsense!\u201d Mr. Chan booms. \u201cIf the government were going to catch us they\u2019d have done so by now! Anyway, I just called to tell you how pleased I am with the latest batch. Such a shame, though, all that talent and your work just gets gobbled up in seconds\u2014tell you what, girl, for the next beef special, how about I tell everyone that the beef came from one of those fancy vertical farms? I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have nice things to say then!\u201d\n \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d Helena says, careful not to let her Cantonese accent slip through. It tends to show after long periods without any human interaction, which is an apt summary of the past few months. \u201cIt\u2019s best if no one pays attention to it.\u201d\n \u201cYou know, Helena, you do good work, but I\u2019m very concerned about your self-esteem, I know if I printed something like that I\u2019d want everyone to appreciate it! Let me tell you about this article my daughter sent me, you know research says that people without friends are prone to . . . \u201d Mr. Chan rambles on as Helena sticks the labels on the boxes\u2014Grilliam Shakespeare, Gyuuzen Sukiyaki, Fatty Chan\u2019s Restaurant\u2014and thankfully hangs up before Helena sinks into further depression. She takes her iKontakt off before heading to the drone delivery office, giving herself some time to recover from Mr. Chan\u2019s relentless cheerfulness.\n Helena has five missed calls by the time she gets back. A red phone icon blares at the corner of her vision before blinking out, replaced by the incoming-call notification. It\u2019s secured and anonymized, which is quite a change from usual. She pops the earpiece in.\n \u201cYeah, Mr. Chan?\u201d\n \u201cThis isn\u2019t Mr. Chan,\u201d someone says. \u201cI have a job for Splendid Beef Enterprises.\u201d\n \u201cAll right, sir. Could I get your name and what you need? If you could provide me with the deadline, that would help too.\u201d\n \u201cI prefer to remain anonymous,\u201d the man says.\n \u201cYes, I understand, secrecy is rather important.\u201d Helena restrains the urge to roll her eyes at how needlessly cryptic this guy is. \u201cCould I know about the deadline and brief?\u201d\n \u201cI need two hundred T-bone steaks by the 8th of August. 38.1 to 40.2 millimeter thickness for each one.\u201d A notification to download t-bone_info.KZIP pops up on her lenses. The most ambitious venture Helena\u2019s undertaken in the past few months has been Gyuuzen\u2019s strips of marbled sukiyaki, and even that felt a bit like pushing it. A whole steak? Hell no.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but I don\u2019t think my business can handle that. Perhaps you could try\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI think you\u2019ll be interested in this job, Helen Lee Jyun Wai.\u201d\n Shit.\n A Sculpere 9410S only takes thirty minutes to disassemble, if you know the right tricks. Manually eject the cell cartridges, slide the external casing off to expose the inner screws, and detach the print heads before disassembling the power unit. There are a few extra steps in this case\u2014for instance, the stickers that say \u201cProperty of Hong Kong Scientific University\u201d and \u201cBioprinting Lab A5\u201d all need to be removed\u2014but a bit of anti-adhesive spray will ensure that everything\u2019s on schedule. Ideally she\u2019d buy a new printer, but she needs to save her cash for the name change once she hits Nanjing.\n It\u2019s not expulsion if you leave before you get kicked out, she tells herself, but even she can tell that\u2019s a lie.\n It\u2019s possible to get a sense of a client\u2019s priorities just from the documents they send. For instance, Mr. Chan usually mentions some recipes that he\u2019s considering, and Ms. Huang from Gyuuzen tends to attach examples of the marbling patterns she wants. This new client seems to have attached a whole document dedicated to the recent amendments in the criminal code, with the ones relevant to Helena (\u201cfive-year statute of limitations,\u201d \u201cpossible death penalty\u201d) conveniently highlighted in neon yellow.\n Sadly, this level of detail hasn\u2019t carried over to the spec sheet.\n \u201cHi again, sir,\u201d Helena says. \u201cI\u2019ve read through what you\u2019ve sent, but I really need more details before starting on the job. Could you provide me with the full measurements? I\u2019ll need the expected length and breadth in addition to the thickness.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s already there. Learn to read.\u201d\n \u201cI know you filled that part in, sir,\u201d Helena says, gritting her teeth. \u201cBut we\u2019re a printing company, not a farm. I\u2019ll need more detail than \u201816-18 month cow, grain-fed, Hereford breed\u2019 to do the job properly.\u201d\n \u201cYou went to university, didn\u2019t you? I\u2019m sure you can figure out something as basic as that, even if you didn\u2019t graduate.\u201d\n \u201cHa ha. Of course.\u201d Helena resists the urge to yank her earpiece out. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on that. Also, there is the issue of pay . . . \u201d\n \u201cAh, yes. I\u2019m quite sure the Yuen family is still itching to prosecute. How about you do the job, and in return, I don\u2019t tell them where you\u2019re hiding?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but even then I\u2019ll need an initial deposit to cover the printing, and of course there\u2019s the matter of the Hereford samples.\u201d Which I already have in the bioreactor, but there is no way I\u2019m letting you know that.\n \u201cFine. I\u2019ll expect detailed daily updates,\u201d Mr. Anonymous says. \u201cI know how you get with deadlines. Don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d\n \u201cOf course not,\u201d Helena says. \u201cAlso, about the deadline\u2014would it be possible to push it back? Four weeks is quite short for this job.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Mr. Anonymous says curtly, and hangs up.\n Helena lets out a very long breath so she doesn\u2019t end up screaming, and takes a moment to curse Mr. Anonymous and his whole family in Cantonese.\n It\u2019s physically impossible to complete the renders and finish the print in four weeks, unless she figures out a way to turn her printer into a time machine, and if that were possible she might as well go back and redo the past few years, or maybe her whole life. If she had majored in art, maybe she\u2019d be a designer by now\u2014or hell, while she\u2019s busy dreaming, she could even have been the next Raverat, the next Mantuana\u2014instead of a failed artist living in a shithole concrete box, clinging to the wreckage of all her past mistakes.\n She leans against the wall for a while, exhales, then slaps on a proxy and starts drafting a help-wanted ad.\n Lily Yonezawa (darknet username: yurisquared) arrives at Nanjing High Tech Industrial Park at 8.58 AM. She\u2019s a short lady with long black hair and circle-framed iKontakts. She\u2019s wearing a loose, floaty dress, smooth lines of white tinged with yellow-green, and there\u2019s a large prismatic bracelet gleaming on her arm. In comparison, Helena is wearing her least holey black blouse and a pair of jeans, which is a step up from her usual attire of myoglobin-stained T-shirt and boxer shorts.\n \u201cSo,\u201d Lily says in rapid, slightly-accented Mandarin as she bounds into the office. \u201cThis place is a beef place, right? I pulled some of the records once I got the address, hope you don\u2019t mind\u2014anyway, what do you want me to help print or render or design or whatever? I know I said I had a background in confections and baking, but I\u2019m totally open to anything!\u201d She pumps her fist in a show of determination. The loose-fitting prismatic bracelet slides up and down.\n Helena blinks at Lily with the weariness of someone who\u2019s spent most of their night frantically trying to make their office presentable. She decides to skip most of the briefing, as Lily doesn\u2019t seem like the sort who needs to be eased into anything.\n \u201cHow much do you know about beef?\u201d\n \u201cI used to watch a whole bunch of farming documentaries with my ex, does that count?\u201d\n \u201cNo. Here at Splendid Beef Enterprises\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOh, by the way, do you have a logo? I searched your company registration but nothing really came up. Need me to design one?\u201d\n \u201cHere at Splendid Beef Enterprises, we make fake beef and sell it to restaurants.\u201d\n \u201cSo, like, soy-lentil stuff?\u201d\n \u201cHomegrown cloned cell lines,\u201d Helena says. \u201cMostly Matsusaka, with some Hereford if clients specify it.\u201d She gestures at the bioreactor humming away in a corner.\n \u201cWait, isn\u2019t fake food like those knockoff eggs made of calcium carbonate? If you\u2019re using cow cells, this seems pretty real to me.\u201d Clearly Lily has a more practical definition of fake than the China Food and Drug Administration.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more like . . . let\u2019s say you have a painting in a gallery and you say it\u2019s by a famous artist. Lots of people would come look at it because of the name alone and write reviews talking about its exquisite use of chiaroscuro, as expected of the old masters, I can\u2019t believe that it looks so real even though it was painted centuries ago. But if you say, hey, this great painting was by some no-name loser, I was just lying about where it came from . . . well, it\u2019d still be the same painting, but people would want all their money back.\u201d\n \u201cOh, I get it,\u201d Lily says, scrutinizing the bioreactor. She taps its shiny polymer shell with her knuckles, and her bracelet bumps against it. Helena tries not to wince. \u201cAnyway, how legal is this? This meat forgery thing?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not illegal yet,\u201d Helena says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a gray area, really.\u201d\n \u201cGreat!\u201d Lily smacks her fist into her open palm. \u201cNow, how can I help? I\u2019m totally down for anything! You can even ask me to clean the office if you want\u2014wow, this is really dusty, maybe I should just clean it to make sure\u2014\u201d\n Helena reminds herself that having an assistant isn\u2019t entirely bad news. Wolfgang Beltracchi was only able to carry out large-scale forgeries with his assistant\u2019s help, and they even got along well enough to get married and have a kid without killing each other.\n Then again, the Beltracchis both got caught, so maybe she shouldn\u2019t be too optimistic.\n Cows that undergo extreme stress while waiting for slaughter are known as dark cutters. The stress causes them to deplete all their glycogen reserves, and when butchered, their meat turns a dark blackish-red. The meat of dark cutters is generally considered low-quality.\n As a low-quality person waiting for slaughter, Helena understands how those cows feel. Mr. Anonymous, stymied by the industrial park\u2019s regular sweeps for trackers and external cameras, has taken to sending Helena grainy aerial photographs of herself together with exhortations to work harder. This isn\u2019t exactly news\u2014she already knew he had her details, and drones are pretty cheap\u2014but still. When Lily raps on the door in the morning, Helena sometimes jolts awake in a panic before she realizes that it isn\u2019t Mr. Anonymous coming for her. This isn\u2019t helped by the fact that Lily\u2019s gentle knocks seem to be equivalent to other people\u2019s knockout blows.\n By now Helena\u2019s introduced Lily to the basics, and she\u2019s a surprisingly quick study. It doesn\u2019t take her long to figure out how to randomize the fat marbling with Fractalgenr8, and she\u2019s been handed the task of printing the beef strips for Gyuuzen and Fatty Chan, then packing them for drone delivery. It\u2019s not ideal, but it lets Helena concentrate on the base model for the T-bone steak, which is the most complicated thing she\u2019s ever tried to render.\n A T-bone steak is a combination of two cuts of meat, lean tenderloin and fatty strip steak, separated by a hard ridge of vertebral bone. Simply cutting into one is a near-religious experience, red meat parting under the knife to reveal smooth white bone, with the beef fat dripping down to pool on the plate. At least, that\u2019s what the socialites\u2019 food blogs say. To be accurate, they say something more like \u201comfg this is sooooooo good,\u201d \u201cthis bones giving me a boner lol,\u201d and \u201chaha im so getting this sonic-cleaned for my collection!!!,\u201d but Helena pretends they actually meant to communicate something more coherent.\n The problem is a lack of references. Most of the accessible photographs only provide a top-down view, and Helena\u2019s left to extrapolate from blurry videos and password-protected previews of bovine myology databases, which don\u2019t get her much closer to figuring out how the meat adheres to the bone. Helena\u2019s forced to dig through ancient research papers and diagrams that focus on where to cut to maximize meat yield, quantifying the difference between porterhouse and T-bone cuts, and not hey, if you\u2019re reading this decades in the future, here\u2019s how to make a good facsimile of a steak. Helena\u2019s tempted to run outside and scream in frustration, but Lily would probably insist on running outside and screaming with her as a matter of company solidarity, and with their luck, probably Mr. Anonymous would find out about Lily right then, even after all the trouble she\u2019s taken to censor any mention of her new assistant from the files and the reports and argh she needs sleep.\n Meanwhile, Lily\u2019s already scheduled everything for print, judging by the way she\u2019s spinning around in Helena\u2019s spare swivel chair.\n \u201cHey, Lily,\u201d Helena says, stifling a yawn. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play around with this for a bit? It\u2019s the base model for a T-bone steak. Just familiarize yourself with the fiber extrusion and mapping, see if you can get it to look like the reference photos. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve saved a copy elsewhere.\u201d Good luck doing the impossible, Helena doesn\u2019t say. You\u2019re bound to have memorized the shortcut for \u2018undo\u2019 by the time I wake up.\n Helena wakes up to Lily humming a cheerful tune and a mostly-complete T-bone model rotating on her screen. She blinks a few times, but no\u2014it\u2019s still there. Lily\u2019s effortlessly linking the rest of the meat, fat and gristle to the side of the bone, deforming the muscle fibers to account for the bone\u2019s presence.\n \u201cWhat did you do,\u201d Helena blurts out.\n Lily turns around to face her, fiddling with her bracelet. \u201cUh, did I do it wrong?\u201d\n \u201cRotate it a bit, let me see the top view. How did you do it?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s a little like the human vertebral column, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s plenty of references for that.\u201d She taps the screen twice, switching focus to an image of a human cross-section. \u201cSee how it attaches here and here? I just used that as a reference, and boom.\u201d\n Ugh, Helena thinks to herself. She\u2019s been out of university for way too long if she\u2019s forgetting basic homology.\n \u201cWait, is it correct? Did I mess up?\u201d\n \u201cNo, no,\u201d Helena says. \u201cThis is really good. Better than . . . well, better than I did, anyway.\u201d\n \u201cAwesome! Can I get a raise?\u201d\n \u201cYou can get yourself a sesame pancake,\u201d Helena says. \u201cMy treat.\u201d\n The brief requires two hundred similar-but-unique steaks at randomized thicknesses of 38.1 to 40.2 mm, and the number and density of meat fibers pretty much precludes Helena from rendering it on her own rig. She doesn\u2019t want to pay to outsource computing power, so they\u2019re using spare processing cycles from other personal rigs and staggering the loads. Straightforward bone surfaces get rendered in afternoons, and fiber-dense tissues get rendered at off-peak hours.\n It\u2019s three in the morning. Helena\u2019s in her Pokko the Penguin T-shirt and boxer shorts, and Lily\u2019s wearing Yayoi Kusama-ish pajamas that make her look like she\u2019s been obliterated by a mass of polka dots. Both of them are staring at their screens, eating cups of Zhuzhu Brand Artificial Char Siew Noodles. As Lily\u2019s job moves to the front of Render@Home\u2019s Finland queue, the graph updates to show a downtick in Mauritius. Helena\u2019s fingers frantically skim across the touchpad, queuing as many jobs as she can.\n Her chopsticks scrape the bottom of the mycefoam cup, and she tilts the container to shovel the remaining fake pork fragments into her mouth. Zhuzhu\u2019s using extruded soy proteins, and they\u2019ve punched up the glutamate percentage since she last bought them. The roasted char siew flavor is lacking, and the texture is crumby since the factory skimped on the extrusion time, but any hot food is practically heaven at this time of the night. Day. Whatever.\n The thing about the rendering stage is that there\u2019s a lot of panic-infused downtime. After queuing the requests, they can\u2019t really do anything else\u2014the requests might fail, or the rig might crash, or they might lose their place in the queue through some accident of fate and have to do everything all over again. There\u2019s nothing to do besides pray that the requests get through, stay awake until the server limit resets, and repeat the whole process until everything\u2019s done. Staying awake is easy for Helena, as Mr. Anonymous has recently taken to sending pictures of rotting corpses to her iKontakt address, captioned \u201cWork hard or this could be you.\u201d Lily seems to be halfway off to dreamland, possibly because she isn\u2019t seeing misshapen lumps of flesh every time she closes her eyes.\n \u201cSo,\u201d Lily says, yawning. \u201cHow did you get into this business?\u201d\n Helena decides it\u2019s too much trouble to figure out a plausible lie, and settles for a very edited version of the truth. \u201cI took art as an elective in high school. My school had a lot of printmaking and 3D printing equipment, so I used it to make custom merch in my spare time\u2014you know, for people who wanted figurines of obscure anime characters, or whatever. Even designed and printed the packaging for them, just to make it look more official. I wanted to study art in university, but that didn\u2019t really work out. Long story short, I ended up moving here from Hong Kong, and since I had a background in printing and bootlegging . . . yeah. What about you?\u201d\n \u201cBefore the confectionery I did a whole bunch of odd jobs. I used to sell merch for my girlfriend\u2019s band, and that\u2019s how I got started with the short-order printing stuff. They were called POMEGRENADE\u2014it was really hard to fit the whole name on a T-shirt. The keychains sold really well, though.\u201d\n \u201cWhat sort of band were they?\u201d\n \u201cSort of noise-rocky Cantopunk at first\u2014there was this one really cute song I liked, If Marriage Means The Death Of Love Then We Must Both Be Zombies\u2014but Cantonese music was a hard sell, even in Guangzhou, so they ended up being kind of a cover band.\u201d\n \u201cOh, Guangzhou,\u201d Helena says in an attempt to sound knowledgeable, before realizing that the only thing she knows about Guangzhou is that the Red Triad has a particularly profitable organ-printing business there. \u201cWait, you understand Cantonese?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Lily says in Cantonese, tone-perfect. \u201cNo one really speaks it around here, so I haven\u2019t used it much.\u201d\n \u201cOh my god, yes, it\u2019s so hard to find Canto-speaking people here.\u201d Helena immediately switches to Cantonese. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me sooner? I\u2019ve been dying to speak it to someone.\u201d\n \u201cSorry, it never came up so I figured it wasn\u2019t very relevant,\u201d Lily says. \u201cAnyway, POMEGRENADE mostly did covers after that, you know, Kick Out The Jams, Zhongnanhai, Chaos Changan, Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues. Whatever got the crowd pumped up, and when they were moshing the hardest, they\u2019d hit the crowd with the Cantopunk and just blast their faces off. I think it left more of an impression that way\u2014like, start with the familiar, then this weird-ass surprise near the end\u2014the merch table always got swamped after they did that.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened with the girlfriend?\u201d\n \u201cWe broke up, but we keep in touch. Do you still do art?\u201d\n \u201cNot really. The closest thing I get to art is this,\u201d Helena says, rummaging through the various boxes under the table to dig out her sketchbooks. She flips one open and hands it to Lily\u2014white against red, nothing but full-page studies of marbling patterns, and it must be one of the earlier ones because it\u2019s downright amateurish. The lines are all over the place, that marbling on the Wagyu (is that even meant to be Wagyu?) is completely inaccurate, and, fuck, are those tear stains?\n Lily turns the pages, tracing the swashes of color with her finger. The hum of the overworked rig fills the room.\n \u201cIt\u2019s awful, I know.\u201d\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Lily\u2019s gaze lingers on Helena\u2019s attempt at a fractal snowflake. \u201cThis is really trippy! If you ever want to do some album art, just let me know and I\u2019ll totally hook you up!\u201d\n Helena opens her mouth to say something about how she\u2019s not an artist, and how studies of beef marbling wouldn\u2019t make very good album covers, but faced with Lily\u2019s unbridled enthusiasm, she decides to nod instead.\n Lily turns the page and it\u2019s that thing she did way back at the beginning, when she was thinking of using a cute cow as the company logo. It\u2019s derivative, it\u2019s kitsch, the whole thing looks like a degraded copy of someone else\u2019s ripoff drawing of a cow\u2019s head, and the fact that Lily\u2019s seriously scrutinizing it makes Helena want to snatch the sketchbook back, toss it into the composter, and sink straight into the concrete floor.\n The next page doesn\u2019t grant Helena a reprieve since there\u2019s a whole series of that stupid cow. Versions upon versions of happy cow faces grin straight at Lily, most of them surrounded by little hearts\u2014what was she thinking? What do hearts even have to do with Splendid Beef Enterprises, anyway? Was it just that they were easy to draw?\n \u201cMan, I wish we had a logo because this would be super cute! I love the little hearts! It\u2019s like saying we put our heart and soul into whatever we do! Oh, wait, but was that what you meant?\u201d\n \u201cIt could be,\u201d Helena says, and thankfully the Colorado server opens before Lily can ask any further questions.\n The brief requires status reports at the end of each workday, but this gradually falls by the wayside once they hit the point where workdays don\u2019t technically end, especially since Helena really doesn\u2019t want to look at an inbox full of increasingly creepy threats. They\u2019re at the pre-print stage, and Lily\u2019s given up on going back to her own place at night so they can have more time for calibration. What looks right on the screen might not look right once it\u2019s printed, and their lives for the past few days have devolved into staring at endless trays of 32-millimeter beef cubes and checking them for myoglobin concentration, color match in different lighting conditions, fat striation depth, and a whole host of other factors.\n There are so many ways for a forgery to go wrong, and only one way it can go right. Helena contemplates this philosophical quandary, and gently thunks her head against the back of her chair.\n \u201cOh my god,\u201d Lily exclaims, shoving her chair back. \u201cI can\u2019t take this anymore! I\u2019m going out to eat something and then I\u2019m getting some sleep. Do you want anything?\u201d She straps on her bunny-patterned filter mask and her metallic sandals. \u201cI\u2019m gonna eat there, so I might take a while to get back.\u201d\n \u201cSesame pancakes, thanks.\u201d\n As Lily slams the door, Helena puts her iKontakt frames back on. The left lens flashes a stream of notifications\u2014fifty-seven missed calls over the past five hours, all from an unknown number. Just then, another call comes in, and she reflexively taps the side of the frame.\n \u201cYou haven\u2019t been updating me on your progress,\u201d Mr. Anonymous says.\n \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, sir,\u201d Helena says flatly, having reached the point of tiredness where she\u2019s ceased to feel anything beyond god I want to sleep. This sets Mr. Anonymous on another rant covering the usual topics\u2014poor work ethic, lack of commitment, informing the Yuen family, prosecution, possible death sentence\u2014and Helena struggles to keep her mouth shut before she says something that she might regret.\n \u201cMaybe I should send someone to check on you right now,\u201d Mr. Anonymous snarls, before abruptly hanging up.\n Helena blearily types out a draft of the report, and makes a note to send a coherent version later in the day, once she gets some sleep and fixes the calibration so she\u2019s not telling him entirely bad news. Just as she\u2019s about to call Lily and ask her to get some hot soy milk to go with the sesame pancakes, the front door rattles in its frame like someone\u2019s trying to punch it down. Judging by the violence, it\u2019s probably Lily. Helena trudges over to open it.\n It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a bulky guy with a flat-top haircut. She stares at him for a moment, then tries to slam the door in his face. He forces the door open and shoves his way inside, grabbing Helena\u2019s arm, and all Helena can think is I can\u2019t believe Mr. Anonymous spent his money on this.\n He shoves her against the wall, gripping her wrist so hard that it\u2019s practically getting dented by his fingertips, and pulls out a switchblade, pressing it against the knuckle of her index finger. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not allowed to kill you, but I can fuck you up real bad. Don\u2019t really need all your fingers, do you, girl?\u201d\n She clears her throat, and struggles to keep her voice from shaking. \u201cI need them to type\u2014didn\u2019t your boss tell you that?\u201d\n \u201cShut up,\u201d Flat-Top says, flicking the switchblade once, then twice, thinking. \u201cDon\u2019t need your face to type, do you?\u201d\n Just then, Lily steps through the door. Flat-Top can\u2019t see her from his angle, and Helena jerks her head, desperately communicating that she should stay out. Lily promptly moves closer.\n Helena contemplates murder.\n Lily edges towards both of them, slides her bracelet past her wrist and onto her knuckles, and makes a gesture at Helena which either means \u2018move to your left\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m imitating a bird, but only with one hand\u2019.\n \u201cHey,\u201d Lily says loudly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d\n Flat-Top startles, loosening his grip on Helena\u2019s arm, and Helena dodges to the left. Just as Lily\u2019s fist meets his face in a truly vicious uppercut, Helena seizes the opportunity to kick him soundly in the shins.\n His head hits the floor, and it\u2019s clear he won\u2019t be moving for a while, or ever. Considering Lily\u2019s normal level of violence towards the front door, this isn\u2019t surprising.\n Lily crouches down to check Flat-Top\u2019s breathing. \u201cWell, he\u2019s still alive. Do you prefer him that way?\u201d\n \u201cDo not kill him.\u201d\n \u201cSure.\u201d Lily taps the side of Flat-Top\u2019s iKontakt frames with her bracelet, and information scrolls across her lenses. \u201cOkay, his name\u2019s Nicholas Liu Honghui . . . blah blah blah . . . hired to scare someone at this address, anonymous client . . . I think he\u2019s coming to, how do you feel about joint locks?\u201d\n It takes a while for Nicholas to stir fully awake. Lily\u2019s on his chest, pinning him to the ground, and Helena\u2019s holding his switchblade to his throat.\n \u201cOkay, Nicholas Liu,\u201d Lily says. \u201cWe could kill you right now, but that\u2019d make your wife and your . . . what is that red thing she\u2019s holding . . . a baby? Yeah, that\u2019d make your wife and ugly baby quite sad. Now, you\u2019re just going to tell your boss that everything went as expected\u2014\u201d\n \u201cTell him that I cried,\u201d Helena interrupts. \u201cI was here alone, and I cried because I was so scared.\u201d\n \u201cRight, got that, Nick? That lady there wept buckets of tears. I don\u2019t exist. Everything went well, and you think there\u2019s no point in sending anyone else over. If you mess up, we\u2019ll visit 42\u2014god, what is this character\u201442 Something Road and let you know how displeased we are. Now, if you apologize for ruining our morning, I probably won\u2019t break your arm.\u201d\n After seeing a wheezing Nicholas to the exit, Lily closes the door, slides her bracelet back onto her wrist, and shakes her head like a deeply disappointed critic. \u201cWhat an amateur. Didn\u2019t even use burner frames\u2014how the hell did he get hired? And that haircut, wow . . . \u201d\n Helena opts to remain silent. She leans against the wall and stares at the ceiling, hoping that she can wake up from what seems to be a very long nightmare.\n \u201cAlso, I\u2019m not gonna push it, but I did take out the trash. Can you explain why that crappy hitter decided to pay us a visit?\u201d\n \u201cYeah. Yeah, okay.\u201d Helena\u2019s stomach growls. \u201cThis may take a while. Did you get the food?\u201d\n \u201cI got your pancakes, and that soy milk place was open, so I got you some. Nearly threw it at that guy, but I figured we\u2019ve got a lot of electronics, so . . . \u201d\n \u201cThanks,\u201d Helena says, taking a sip. It\u2019s still hot.\n Hong Kong Scientific University\u2019s bioprinting program is a prestigious pioneer program funded by mainland China, and Hong Kong is the test bed before the widespread rollout. The laboratories are full of state-of-the-art medical-grade printers and bioreactors, and the instructors are all researchers cherry-picked from the best universities.\n As the star student of the pioneer batch, Lee Jyun Wai Helen (student number A3007082A) is selected for a special project. She will help the head instructor work on the basic model of a heart for a dextrocardial patient, the instructor will handle the detailed render and the final print, and a skilled surgeon will do the transplant. As the term progresses and the instructor gets busier and busier, Helen\u2019s role gradually escalates to doing everything except the final print and the transplant. It\u2019s a particularly tricky render, since dextrocardial hearts face right instead of left, but her practice prints are cell-level perfect.\n Helen hands the render files and her notes on the printing process to the instructor, then her practical exams begin and she forgets all about it.\n The Yuen family discovers Madam Yuen\u2019s defective heart during their mid-autumn family reunion, halfway through an evening harbor cruise. Madam Yuen doesn\u2019t make it back to shore, and instead of a minor footnote in a scientific paper, Helen rapidly becomes front-and-center in an internal investigation into the patient\u2019s death.\n Unofficially, the internal investigation discovers that the head instructor\u2019s improper calibration of the printer during the final print led to a slight misalignment in the left ventricle, which eventually caused severe ventricular dysfunction and acute graft failure.\n Officially, the root cause of the misprint is Lee Jyun Wai Helen\u2019s negligence and failure to perform under deadline pressure. Madam Yuen\u2019s family threatens to prosecute, but the criminal code doesn\u2019t cover failed organ printing. Helen is expelled, and the Hong Kong Scientific University quietly negotiates a settlement with the Yuens.\n After deciding to steal the bioprinter and flee, Helen realizes that she doesn\u2019t have enough money for a full name change and an overseas flight. She settles for a minor name alteration and a flight to Nanjing.\n \u201cWow,\u201d says Lily. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m pretty sure you got ripped off with the name alteration thing, there\u2019s no way it costs that much. Also, you used to have pigtails? Seriously?\u201d\n Helena snatches her old student ID away from Lily. \u201cAnyway, under the amendments to Article 335, making or supplying substandard printed organs is now an offence punishable by death. The family\u2019s itching to prosecute. If we don\u2019t do the job right, Mr. Anonymous is going to disclose my whereabouts to them.\u201d\n \u201cOkay, but from what you\u2019ve told me, this guy is totally not going to let it go even after you\u2019re done. At my old job, we got blackmailed like that all the time, which was really kind of irritating. They\u2019d always try to bargain, and after the first job, they\u2019d say stuff like \u2018if you don\u2019t do me this favor I\u2019m going to call the cops and tell them everything\u2019 just to weasel out of paying for the next one.\u201d\n \u201cWait. Was this at the bakery or the merch stand?\u201d\n \u201cUh.\u201d Lily looks a bit sheepish. This is quite unusual, considering that Lily has spent the past four days regaling Helena with tales of the most impressive blood blobs from her period, complete with comparisons to their failed prints. \u201cAre you familiar with the Red Triad? The one in Guangzhou?\u201d\n \u201cYou mean the organ printers?\u201d\n \u201cYeah, them. I kind of might have been working there before the bakery . . . ?\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n Lily fiddles with the lacy hem of her skirt. \u201cWell, I mean, the bakery experience seemed more relevant, plus you don\u2019t have to list every job you\u2019ve ever done when you apply for a new one, right?\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Helena says, trying not to think too hard about how all the staff at Splendid Beef Enterprises are now prime candidates for the death penalty. \u201cOkay. What exactly did you do there?\u201d\n \u201cEars and stuff, bladders, spare fingers . . . you\u2019d be surprised how many people need those. I also did some bone work, but that was mainly for the diehards\u2014most of the people we worked on were pretty okay with titanium substitutes. You know, simple stuff.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not simple.\u201d\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I was printing fancy reversed hearts or anything, and even with the asshole clients it was way easier than baking. Have you ever tried to extrude a spun-sugar globe so you could put a bunch of powder-printed magpies inside? And don\u2019t get me started on cleaning the nozzles after extrusion, because wow . . . \u201d\n Helena decides not to question Lily\u2019s approach to life, because it seems like a certain path to a migraine. \u201cMaybe we should talk about this later.\u201d\n \u201cRight, you need to send the update! Can I help?\u201d\n The eventual message contains very little detail and a lot of pleading. Lily insists on adding typos just to make Helena seem more rattled, and Helena\u2019s way too tired to argue. After starting the autoclean cycle for the printheads, they set an alarm and flop on Helena\u2019s mattress for a nap.\n As Helena\u2019s drifting off, something occurs to her. \u201cLily? What happened to those people? The ones who tried to blackmail you?\u201d\n \u201cOh,\u201d Lily says casually. \u201cI crushed them.\u201d\n The brief specifies that the completed prints need to be loaded into four separate podcars on the morning of 8 August, and provides the delivery code for each. They haven\u2019t been able to find anything in Helena\u2019s iKontakt archives, so their best bet is finding a darknet user who can do a trace.\n Lily\u2019s fingers hover over the touchpad. \u201cIf we give him the codes, this guy can check the prebooked delivery routes. He seems pretty reliable, do you want to pay the bounty?\u201d\n \u201cDo it,\u201d Helena says.\n The resultant map file is a mess of meandering lines. They flow across most of Nanjing, criss-crossing each other, but eventually they all terminate at the cargo entrance of the Grand Domaine Luxury Hotel on Jiangdong Middle Road.\n \u201cWell, he\u2019s probably not a guest who\u2019s going to eat two hundred steaks on his own.\u201d Lily taps her screen. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for a hotel restaurant?\u201d\n Helena pulls up the Grand Domaine\u2019s web directory, setting her iKontakt to highlight any mentions of restaurants or food in the descriptions. For some irritating design reason, all the booking details are stored in garish images. She snatches the entire August folder, flipping through them one by one before pausing.\n The foreground of the image isn\u2019t anything special, just elaborate cursive English stating that Charlie Zhang and Cherry Cai Si Ping will be celebrating their wedding with a ten-course dinner on August 8th at the Royal Ballroom of the Grand Domaine Luxury Hotel.\n What catches her eye is the background. It\u2019s red with swirls and streaks of yellow-gold. Typical auspicious wedding colors, but displayed in a very familiar pattern.\n It\u2019s the marbled pattern of T-bone steak.\n Cherry Cai Si Ping is the daughter of Dominic Cai Yongjing, a specialist in livestock and a new player in Nanjing\u2019s agri-food arena. According to Lily\u2019s extensive knowledge of farming documentaries, Dominic Cai Yongjing is also \u201cthe guy with the eyebrows\u201d and \u201cthat really boring guy who keeps talking about nothing.\u201d\n \u201cMost people have eyebrows,\u201d Helena says, loading one of Lily\u2019s recommended documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t see . . . oh. Wow.\u201d\n \u201cI told you. I mean, I usually like watching stuff about farming, but last year he just started showing up everywhere with his stupid waggly brows! When I watched this with my ex we just made fun of him non-stop.\u201d\n Helena fast-forwards through the introduction of Modern Manufacturing: The Vertical Farmer, which involves the camera panning upwards through hundreds of vertically-stacked wire cages. Dominic Cai talks to the host in English, boasting about how he plans to be a key figure in China\u2019s domestic beef industry. He explains his \u201cpatented methods\u201d for a couple of minutes, which involves stating and restating that his farm is extremely clean and filled with only the best cattle.\n \u201cBut what about bovine parasitic cancer?\u201d the host asks. \u201cIsn\u2019t the risk greater in such a cramped space? If the government orders a quarantine, your whole farm . . . \u201d\n \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, our hygiene standards are impeccable, and our stock is purebred Hereford!\u201d Cai slaps the flank of a cow through the cage bars, and it moos irritatedly in response. \u201cThere is absolutely no way it could happen here!\u201d\n Helena does some mental calculations. Aired last year, when the farm recently opened, and that cow looks around six months old . . . and now a request for steaks from cows that are sixteen to eighteen months old . . .\n \u201cSo,\u201d Lily says, leaning on the back of Helena\u2019s chair. \u201cBovine parasitic cancer?\u201d\n \u201cJudging by the timing, it probably hit them last month. It\u2019s usually the older cows that get infected first. He\u2019d have killed them to stop the spread . . . but if it\u2019s the internal strain, the tumors would have made their meat unusable after excision. His first batch of cows was probably meant to be for the wedding dinner. What we\u2019re printing is the cover-up.\u201d\n \u201cBut it\u2019s not like steak\u2019s a standard course in wedding dinners or anything, right? Can\u2019t they just change it to roast duck or abalone or something?\u201d Lily looks fairly puzzled, probably because she hasn\u2019t been subjected to as many weddings as Helena has.\n \u201cMr. Cai\u2019s the one bankrolling it, so it\u2019s a staging ground for the Cai family to show how much better they are than everyone else. You saw the announcement\u2014he\u2019s probably been bragging to all his guests about how they\u2019ll be the first to taste beef from his vertical farm. Changing it now would be a real loss of face.\u201d\n \u201cOkay,\u201d Lily says. \u201cI have a bunch of ideas, but first of all, how much do you care about this guy\u2019s face?\u201d\n Helena thinks back to her inbox full of corpse pictures, the countless sleepless nights she\u2019s endured, the sheer terror she felt when she saw Lily step through the door. \u201cNot very much at all.\u201d\n \u201cAll right.\u201d Lily smacks her fist into her palm. \u201cLet\u2019s give him a nice surprise.\u201d\n The week before the deadline vanishes in a blur of printing, re-rendering, and darknet job requests. Helena\u2019s been nothing but polite to Mr. Cai ever since the hitter\u2019s visit, and has even taken to video calls lately, turning on the camera on her end so that Mr. Cai can witness her progress. It\u2019s always good to build rapport with clients.\n \u201cSo, sir,\u201d Helena moves the camera, slowly panning so it captures the piles and piles of cherry-red steaks, zooming in on the beautiful fat strata which took ages to render. \u201cHow does this look? I\u2019ll be starting the dry-aging once you approve, and loading it into the podcars first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d\n \u201cFairly adequate. I didn\u2019t expect much from the likes of you, but this seems satisfactory. Go ahead.\u201d\n Helena tries her hardest to keep calm. \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way, sir. Rest assured you\u2019ll be getting your delivery on schedule . . . by the way, I don\u2019t suppose you could transfer the money on delivery? Printing the bone matter costs a lot more than I thought.\u201d\n \u201cOf course, of course, once it\u2019s delivered and I inspect the marbling. Quality checks, you know?\u201d\n Helena adjusts the camera, zooming in on the myoglobin dripping from the juicy steaks, and adopts her most sorrowful tone. \u201cWell, I hate to rush you, but I haven\u2019t had much money for food lately . . . \u201d\n Mr. Cai chortles. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s got to be hard on you! You\u2019ll receive the fund transfer sometime this month, and in the meantime why don\u2019t you treat yourself and print up something nice to eat?\u201d\n Lily gives Helena a thumbs-up, then resumes crouching under the table and messaging her darknet contacts, careful to stay out of Helena\u2019s shot. The call disconnects.\n \u201cLet\u2019s assume we won\u2019t get any further payment. Is everything ready?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d Lily says. \u201cWhen do we need to drop it off?\u201d\n \u201cLet\u2019s try for five AM. Time to start batch-processing.\u201d\n Helena sets the enzyme percentages, loads the fluid into the canister, and they both haul the steaks into the dry-ager unit. The machine hums away, spraying fine mists of enzymatic fluid onto the steaks and partially dehydrating them, while Helena and Lily work on assembling the refrigerated delivery boxes. Once everything\u2019s neatly packed, they haul the boxes to the nearest podcar station. As Helena slams box after box into the cargo area of the podcars, Lily types the delivery codes into their front panels. The podcars boot up, sealing themselves shut, and zoom off on their circuitous route to the Grand Domaine Luxury Hotel.\n They head back to the industrial park. Most of their things have already been shoved into backpacks, and Helena begins breaking the remaining equipment down for transport.\n A Sculpere 9410S takes twenty minutes to disassemble if you\u2019re doing it for the second time. If someone\u2019s there to help you manually eject the cell cartridges, slide the external casing off, and detach the print heads so you can disassemble the power unit, you might be able to get that figure down to ten. They\u2019ll buy a new printer once they figure out where to settle down, but this one will do for now.\n It\u2019s not running away if we\u2019re both going somewhere, Helena thinks to herself, and this time it doesn\u2019t feel like a lie.\n There aren\u2019t many visitors to Mr. Chan\u2019s restaurant during breakfast hours, and he\u2019s sitting in a corner, reading a book. Helena waves at him.\n \u201cHelena!\u201d he booms, surging up to greet her. \u201cLong time no see, and who is this?\u201d\n \u201cOh, we met recently. She\u2019s helped me out a lot,\u201d Helena says, judiciously avoiding any mention of Lily\u2019s name. She holds a finger to her lips, and surprisingly, Mr. Chan seems to catch on. Lily waves at Mr. Chan, then proceeds to wander around the restaurant, examining their collection of porcelain plates.\n \u201cAnyway, since you\u2019re my very first client, I thought I\u2019d let you know in person. I\u2019m going traveling with my . . . friend, and I won\u2019t be around for the next few months at least.\u201d\n \u201cOh, that\u2019s certainly a shame! I was planning a black pepper hotplate beef special next month, but I suppose black pepper hotplate extruded protein will do just fine. When do you think you\u2019ll be coming back?\u201d\n Helena looks at Mr. Chan\u2019s guileless face, and thinks, well, her first client deserves a bit more honesty. \u201cActually, I probably won\u2019t be running the business any longer. I haven\u2019t decided yet, but I think I\u2019m going to study art. I\u2019m really, really sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Chan.\u201d\n \u201cNo, no, pursuing your dreams, well, that\u2019s not something you should be apologizing for! I\u2019m just glad you finally found a friend!\u201d\n Helena glances over at Lily, who\u2019s currently stuffing a container of cellulose toothpicks into the side pocket of her bulging backpack.\n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad too,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chan, but we have a flight to catch in a couple of hours, and the bus is leaving soon . . . \u201d\n \u201cNonsense! I\u2019ll pay for your taxi fare, and I\u2019ll give you something for the road. Airplane food is awful these days!\u201d\n Despite repeatedly declining Mr. Chan\u2019s very generous offers, somehow Helena and Lily end up toting bags and bags of fresh steamed buns to their taxi.\n \u201cOh, did you see the news?\u201d Mr. Chan asks. \u201cThat vertical farmer\u2019s daughter is getting married at some fancy hotel tonight. Quite a pretty girl, good thing she didn\u2019t inherit those eyebrows\u2014\u201d\n Lily snorts and accidentally chokes on her steamed bun. Helena claps her on the back.\n \u201c\u2014and they\u2019re serving steak at the banquet, straight from his farm! Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, Helena, you\u2019re talented at what you do\u2014but a good old-fashioned slab of real meat, now, that\u2019s the ticket!\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Helena says. \u201cIt certainly is.\u201d\n All known forgeries are failures, but sometimes that\u2019s on purpose. Sometimes a forger decides to get revenge by planting obvious flaws in their work, then waiting for them to be revealed, making a fool of everyone who initially claimed the work was authentic. These flaws can take many forms\u2014deliberate anachronisms, misspelled signatures, rude messages hidden beneath thick coats of paint\u2014or a picture of a happy cow, surrounded by little hearts, etched into the T-bone of two hundred perfectly-printed steaks.\n While the known forgers are the famous ones, the best forgers are the ones that don\u2019t get caught\u2014the old woman selling her deceased husband\u2019s collection to an avaricious art collector, the harried-looking mother handing the cashier a battered 50-yuan note, or the two women at the airport, laughing as they collect their luggage, disappearing into the crowd."}

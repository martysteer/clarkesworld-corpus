I\u2019d like to take a moment to congratulate this year\u2019s Nebula nominees. In particular, I\u2019d like to call your attention to the short story category where three Clarkesworld stories have taken six of the nominations:\n- \u201cCat Pictures Please\u201d by Naomi Kritzer (Clarkesworld 1/15)\n- \u201cWhen Your Child Strays From God\u201d by Sam J. Miller (Clarkesworld 7/15)\n- \u201cToday I Am Paul\u201d by Martin L. Shoemaker (Clarkesworld 8/15)\nWe are quite proud of our authors and wish them all the best. I\u2019ll be on-hand at the Nebula Award Ceremony this year to cheer them on and I hope some of you are too.\nOne anecdote before we move on: I attended last year\u2019s ceremony and accepted Sam\u2019s story during the mass signing. I think this means I have to start doing more in-person story acceptances!\nStill on the Nebula high, I decided to crack open my spreadsheet and start tallying this year\u2019s reader\u2019s poll results. The data is always interesting and it was nice to have so many readers participating this year. I was pleasantly surprised to see an influx of newer readers taking part this year. Welcome!\nCONTEST\nThis year we included a special drawing for print and ebook copies of our latest anthology, Clarkesworld: Year Eight. Ten lucky winners were picked at random and have been notified by email. If you didn\u2019t win, it\u2019s now available for sale from the usual places.\nCOVER ART\n1 - \u201cSpring Day is Coming\u201d by Liu Junwei\n2 (TIE) - \u201cGate World\u201d by Julie Dillon\n2 (TIE) - \u201cMegafauna Europa\u201d by Julie Dillon\n3 - \u201cA-boushi-ya\u201d by shichigoro-shingo\nThis category is normally close but this year, there was a small gap between our winners and the cluster of eight remaining works with nearly equal vote totals. It seems as though some people had as much trouble picking their favorite as I did.\nSTORIES\n- \u201cSo Much Cooking\u201d by Naomi Kritzer\n- \u201cYuanyuan\u2019s Bubbles\u201d by Liu Cixin, translated by Carmen Yiling Yan (tie)\n\u201cCat Pictures Please\u201d by Naomi Kritzer (tie)\n- \u201cCassandra\u201d by Ken Liu (tie)\n\u201cThe Three Resurrections of Jessica Churchill\u201d by Kelly Robson (tie)\n\u201cToday I am Paul\u201d by Martin L. Shoemaker (tie)\nOur readers had a clear favorite this year, but after that were often split. Despite a higher than normal number of voters this year, we still had a lot of ties. If we extended the list to the top five we\u2019d have added five more stories. I\u2019ll take that to mean you liked what we did last year.\nCongratulations to all our winners and thanks to everyone for participating!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

The game\u2019s latest update came out last month and it was particularly well-timed. We\u2019ve spent a lot of hours trying out the new features and fighting our way towards higher light levels. As we battle aliens, rescue Russian AIs, and run over one another with sparrows\u2014they are like the speeder bikes in Return of the Jedi\u2014we often talk about Clarkesworld stuff. Even when I\u2019m trying to relax, this place comes with me . . . that\u2019s not a complaint, though!\n We\u2019ve had all sorts of things to talk about last month:\n \n 2015 BSFA Award for Best Short Story went to \u201cThree Cups of Grief, By Starlight\u201d by Aliette de Bodard (Clarkesworld #100, January 2015)\n The 2015 Theodore A. Sturgeon Memorial Award Finalists were announced and included, \u201cThe Three Resurrections of Jessica Churchill\u201d by Kelly Robson (Clarkesworld #101, February 2015)\n The Nebula Award Weekend is this month\u2014Kate and I will be there\u2014and three Clarkesworld stories are in the running for Best Short Story: \u201cCat Pictures Please\u201d by Naomi Kritzer (Clarkesworld #100, January 2015), \u201cWhen Your Child Strays From God\u201d by Sam J. Miller (Clarkesworld #106, July 2015), \u201cToday I Am Paul\u201d by Martin L. Shoemaker (Clarkesworld #107, August 2015)\n Disney: pro, con, or cruise?\n How a Destiny anthology is becoming a mini dream project\n And my stressing out over editing the Nebula Award issue of The SFWA Bulletin.\n \n We also spent a lot of time talking about the Hugo Awards. That said, I have no desire to fuel the fires of controversy that once again swirl around the process and some of the nominees. I\u2019ve seen more than enough to last me. However I do want to say that I\u2019m thrilled to be a finalist for Best Editor Short Form for the fourth time. It means a lot to me that I accomplished this without the real or imagined assistance of a special list or slate. It leaves me with no doubt that my readers put me on this ballot for nothing more than the work I\u2019ve done here and at Forever Magazine. And for that, and your nomination, I thank you. I am proud to represent the stories we published last year.\n A special thank you also goes to Bungie for providing me with a valuable stress-relieving tool. It\u2019s been particularly handy this month, as perhaps my kill volume and 335 light level can readily attest to.\n So, do any of you play?\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

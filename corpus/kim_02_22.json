She\u2019s scrubbed the tiles of the large baths. She\u2019s manned the counter that sells squeeze packs of shampoo, baked eggs, and cold drinks. Jinah is now a massage lady. It\u2019s not a glamorous job.\n Jinah stands in her old underwear and scrapes the future from women\u2019s skin. Their scales fall to the floor. The women sit up scoured red and smooth.\n The scales are impossible to see unless you\u2019ve learned how to look, but impossible to miss once you\u2019ve learned how to see them. They\u2019re translucent, shimmering, and colorful. They look too beautiful to be what they are\u2014chrysalises for concrete lives, locking in a course of action for the person they\u2019re attached to. Once the scales turn opaque, they become impossible to remove.\n It\u2019s curiously satisfying to scrub the immature scales away with the rough washcloth. They dissolve when they fall on the wet floor.\n Jinah\u2019s fingers are always wrinkled. Even when she dries off and slathers lotion over her skin, there are lines that take hours to un-crease. Her daughter likes to run her chubby fingers across them.\n \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you grow up,\u201d Jinah tells her daughter, who sits in Jinah\u2019s lap while they watch children\u2019s cartoons. Yebin presses her hand against Jinah\u2019s, and Jinah cups her fingers around Yebin\u2019s whole hand.\n The faintest shimmer of scales brocades Yebin\u2019s skin, a contrast to the nearly opaque tessellation across the back of Jinah\u2019s hands, running up her arms like little gleaming pebbles. Sometimes Jinah picks a few off in the bathroom and watches them melt away in the sink. The scales take a few days to grow back, coming in pale and near-transparent. It eases something in Jinah\u2019s chest to be rid of them, even if the majority remain.\n \u201cI\u2019m never going to grow up,\u201d Yebin says. Jinah drops a kiss on her daughter\u2019s head and wonders how many other little girls have said the same thing with the same confidence, how many other little girls live inside the women whose scales she scrapes away.\n Jinah has regulars at the massage table. There\u2019s an old lady who comes in every two weeks, complaining about everything under the sun. An office lady with poor circulation, who has the coldest feet Jinah has ever felt. Jinah has recommended traditional medicine, but the office lady never listens. Then there\u2019s Lee Injung, who has the sort of body that people pay money for and a nicotine tremor in her hands.\n \u201cHey, Jinah,\u201d Injung says. \u201cSame as last week, please.\u201d\n Jinah gestures for her to get on the massage table. Injung slides on and turns onto her front. Injung is one of those people who are always trying to outrun their future, covered in scales so dense it almost looks like snakeskin. Sometimes Jinah wonders if Injung can see them, and that\u2019s why the woman is practically religious about having her limbs scrubbed raw and red. Or maybe it\u2019s just that Injung considers Jinah a friend.\n \u201cI\u2019m thinking about quitting my job,\u201d Injung says.\n \u201cAgain?\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you mean, again?\u201d\n \u201cYou quit your last job, too\u2014what was it, hairdressing?\u2014to work at that makeup store.\u201d\n \u201cHairdressing was boring! Everything\u2019s boring! I thought selling makeup would be interesting, but it turns out that it\u2019s the same as selling everything else.\u201d\n \u201cOf course it\u2019s like everything else\u2014it\u2019s still just products,\u201d Jinah says.\n \u201cI just thought . . . \u201d Injung trails off wistfully. \u201cHey, how do you like your job?\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t want my job,\u201d Jinah says, scrubbing at a particularly stubborn patch of scales on Injung\u2019s lower back. Her arms ache with the effort.\n \u201cYeah, but how do you like it?\u201d\n Jinah pauses, unbends, slaps Injung\u2019s thigh. Injung shrieks.\n \u201cHow do you think I like it?\u201d Jinah says. \u201cHey, you think I would be doing this if I wasn\u2019t getting paid? If my husband wasn\u2019t dead? If I didn\u2019t have a kid to raise?\u201d\n \u201cOw, I\u2019m sorry, Jinah! You know I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Injung whines.\n \u201cDon\u2019t talk about things you don\u2019t know about,\u201d Jinah says, rubbing Injung\u2019s thigh in apology. A few scales flake off.\n Injung is quiet. Jinah concentrates on removing the rest of the scales from Injung\u2019s back. The sound of rushing water from the showerheads and the fake waterfall fade into the background.\n \u201cThere must be something you like about it,\u201d Injung says. Jinah sighs. Injung, the terminal optimist.\n \u201cWell, it really gives you a new perspective on people\u2019s bodies,\u201d Jinah says, scraping the last scale from Injung\u2019s skin.\n \u201cMm,\u201d Injung says, sounding thoughtful. \u201cWell. I\u2019m going to quit the makeup job. I\u2019ve decided.\u201d\n Jinah couldn\u2019t see the scales until she had worked at the bathhouse for months. It had been hard. She\u2019s grateful to have landed at the bathhouse, after her husband\u2019s death\u2014there are so many more unsavory outcomes. But it was physical work, and Jinah had gone from being a high schooler to a college dropout to a housewife. She adjusted. She cleaned the bathhouse. She took care of her daughter. She put balm on her sore limbs and waterproof bandages over her blisters. She asked for more responsibilities at work.\n Kang Yuna, the owner-manager, had nodded and said, \u201cI knew I did the right thing, taking a chance on you,\u201d and told Jinah that one of the massage ladies was retiring. So Jinah learned how to scrub flesh into submission.\n For the first few months, Yuna occasionally worked alongside her, which Jinah found strange because Yuna, as the owner of the entire bathhouse, has better things to do with her time. Seemingly arbitrarily, Yuna would say, \u201cI\u2019m taking care of this one,\u201d and wave a woman over to her table. There didn\u2019t seem to be a uniting factor to the customers Yuna chose, and Yuna scrubbed their dead skin away with the same brisk efficiency she scrubbed everyone else\u2019s. Jinah watched Yuna work, trying to find a pattern, but all she saw was her boss, the rough washcloth, and the skin.\n Then one afternoon, Jinah noticed a glimmer across a customer\u2019s arm. She assumed it was some sort of body glitter, or a trick of the light on wet flesh. Then the next week she saw the perfect curves of the scales that were flying off while Yuna scrubbed. Jinah\u2019s eyes kept being drawn back to the way the scales sparkled as they melted on the wet floor.\n When Jinah looked up again, Yuna\u2014who now seemed to be covered in green, semitranslucent iridescence\u2014was watching her back. Jinah\u2019s face must have betrayed some sort of surprise, because Yuna raised her eyebrows and pointed her chin, gesturing for Jinah to look around the bathing room.\n Jinah glanced at the other women, washing their hair, soaking in tubs, and was amazed to see that nearly three-quarters of the women there had similar glimmering scales, of varying colors and opacities. She looked down at her own hands and saw that their backs were covered in translucent blue.\n \u201cWhat is\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou can see them, yeah?\u201d Yuna cut her off. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk after work.\u201d\n Jinah just nodded, not entirely trusting that this wasn\u2019t a hallucination. But Yuna explained in her office with the door closed, and the scales never left Jinah\u2019s field of vision.\n The scales are the calcification of choices. Some people have more of them than others\u2014the world having been less forgiving, or their personalities less flexible. Eventually everyone has them, and eventually they grow opaque. It takes a manual touch, at that point, to rid a person of the future they don\u2019t want. To allow them to change.\n \u201cDon\u2019t ask me why you can see them,\u201d Yuna said, in the office after work. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because the bathhouse is cursed.\u201d\n \u201cThe bathhouse is cursed?\u201d\n \u201cOkay, it\u2019s not cursed,\u201d Yuna had said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the massage lady position that\u2019s cursed.\u201d\n Yuna went into a tangent after that. Something about the way the physicality of the job contributes to a sort of cosmic sensitivity, something about acupuncture pressure points and energy pools, how Yuna had been pretty skeptical but there\u2019s been a \u201cone-hundred-percent correlation between scales and choices, and it makes the job way more interesting, so it\u2019s good that you can see them, Jinah.\u201d\n \u201cJust use your best judgement on whose scales to scrape,\u201d Yuna finished with. \u201cYou can kind of tell when people are happy with their lives and when they\u2019re not.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jinah said, frowning.\n Yuna waved a dismissive hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re worried, just scrape everyone who comes for a massage. They lay down for a massage, they must be stressed enough to need a change, anyway.\u201d\n They didn\u2019t talk about the scales on Jinah\u2019s arms, the scales crawling up Yuna\u2019s neck. Jinah diligently scrapes the scales off of every client who lies on her table. She\u2019s not sure it\u2019s the most responsible choice. It makes her feel powerful, though, to scrape away the future without her client\u2019s knowledge.\n Sometimes Jinah fantasizes about really getting in there with the rough washcloth and scraping every last scale off her own body. If she scrubbed deep enough, maybe she could stop being Yebin\u2019s mother. Maybe she could stop making all her decisions with Yebin in mind. Then she could be awful to Yebin, who was an accident, who forced her shotgun marriage, whose name is derived from the word that means to be beautiful.\n They\u2019re ugly thoughts. Jinah is ashamed of them. They\u2019re why she restricts herself to plucking a few scales from her skin at a time. Why she restricts herself to scraping the scales off customers. Jinah\u2019s afraid of what she\u2019ll do if she\u2019s given options. Better to stay where she is.\n On school holidays, Jinah takes Yebin with her to the bathhouse. She brings Yebin\u2019s strawberry shampoo, and Yebin brings her mermaid Barbie. Jinah helps Yebin wash with a soft washcloth as Yebin squirms.\n \u201cYou have to be clean to get into the pools,\u201d Jinah tells her daughter. Yebin is always so excited to get to play in the baths before any customers arrive.\n \u201cI\u2019m clean,\u201d Yebin protests. Jinah finishes soaping her up and tells her to go rinse before getting in the pool, and yes, Barbie needs to rinse too. Yebin stands under a showerhead, and Jinah wipes down the massage tables and scrubs the stone basins before the bathhouse opens. Maybe a better mother would keep a closer eye on Yebin, or would have the money for a babysitter. Jinah taught Yebin to doggy paddle at the nearby public pool and has always impressed the importance of not running on wet tile.\n She watches out of the corner of her eye as Yebin picks up her Barbie and slides into the cold pool, kicking around in the water. Yebin looks happy. Even from across the hall, Jinah can see the faintest shimmer of scales on Yebin\u2019s skin as she splashes. She looks like a little fish.\n Jinah used to want a lot of things from life. She wanted to go to a good college. Then she wanted a happy marriage. Now she wants to have enough left over after rent-bills-food every month. She wants a better job. She wants Yebin to have the opportunities that Jinah tossed aside because she didn\u2019t know what she wanted.\n She wonders what her customers want when they get on the massage table. They don\u2019t know what Jinah is doing. Removing the scales isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s just the byproduct of physical labor. Returning their capability for change doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the women will change, or that they want to change. Jinah figures on average, she\u2019s doing a net-neutral in the world. She doesn\u2019t know enough about the women she scrapes down to say whether she is doing good. Jinah sometimes speculates based on the conceptual idea of the woman who regularly gets a massage, the woman who wants a massage that hurts, that leaves the skin feeling flayed. That seems like a woman who wants to change, who wants to believe in the inherent superiority of renewal.\n Halfway through her sixth year working at the bathhouse, Yuna asks Jinah to stay late. Jinah\u2019s heart sinks. Yes, she\u2019s worked here six years, but the economy is terrible, and this must be the moment that her luck runs out. Yuna must be firing her. Jinah has half a college degree and a schedule bounded by her daughter. Finding a new job is going to be a nightmare.\n Jinah walks into the manager\u2019s office with clenched hands so that they won\u2019t tremble. Yuna smiles at her. Over the years, Yuna\u2019s scales have darkened to a near-opaque emerald, like a very strange and colorful jacket.\n \u201cYou should stop picking off your scales,\u201d Yuna says. \u201cYou look all patchy.\u201d\n \u201cNo one can see them.\u201d\n \u201cI can see them,\u201d Yuna says, and then shakes her head. \u201cLook. Jinah. Are you happy here?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d Jinah says quickly. There\u2019s no other answer you can give when your boss asks you that question.\n \u201cThen stop picking off your scales,\u201d Yuna says. \u201cI have a proposition for you.\u201d\n Relief washes over Jinah\u2019s psyche. \u201cYou\u2019re not firing me?\u201d\n Yuna laughs. \u201cWhat? Why would you think that? You\u2019re our hardest worker. I\u2019m asking you if you want a promotion. I\u2019ve run this business ever since my husband died\u2014that\u2019s something we have in common, did you know that?\u201d\n Jinah nods. It\u2019s why Yuna has been so sympathetic to her position.\n \u201cAnd if I stay here longer, soon it\u2019ll be impossible for me to leave. Look at the color of these things.\u201d Yuna gestures down her arm at the shiny green coating. \u201cSo here\u2019s what I propose. You scrape these off of me. I hand over the bathhouse to you.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2014\u201d Jinah begins, clamping down the rest of the sentence, which ends with don\u2019t want to work here forever. Yuna smiles as if she can hear Jinah\u2019s unspoken thoughts.\n \u201cJust think about it, Jinah,\u201d Yuna says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity. There are worse lives.\u201d\n Then why don\u2019t you live this one, Jinah thinks but doesn\u2019t say, and tells Yuna Thank you, and I\u2019ll think about the offer seriously before leaving to pick up her daughter from school.\n Too agitated to cook, Jinah takes her daughter out for dinner at Lotteria. Yuna\u2019s proposition rolls around in her head like a stone. Yebin doesn\u2019t notice her distraction, preoccupied by dipping chicken nuggets in ketchup.\n \u201cWhat are you going to be when you grow up?\u201d Jinah asks her daughter.\n \u201cAn Olympic swimmer,\u201d Yebin says. \u201cOr an astronaut. Or I\u2019m going to sell snacks at the bathhouse and eat them all day.\u201d\n \u201cWhere did you learn about the Olympics?\u201d Jinah asks, surprised out of her self-rumination. Yebin is six and a half.\n \u201cFrom school,\u201d Yebin says. \u201cWhen we were learning about world cultures.\u201d\n Jinah has no idea what world cultures means for first graders. Yebin puts three french fries in her mouth. Jinah wipes a smear of ketchup from Yebin\u2019s cheek. Yebin\u2019s skin is still baby-soft. When Jinah concentrates, she can feel the seams of the scales overlaying it, but it\u2019s still just the barest whisper of a concrete future.\n She doesn\u2019t know why Yebin already has scales. Jinah doesn\u2019t know if this is somehow her fault. Maybe Jinah is not providing for Yebin in a way where Yebin feels able to change. Sometimes Jinah wants to scrub her daughter raw.\n \u201cI can\u2019t take the job,\u201d Jinah says the next morning, walking into Yuna\u2019s office. \u201cI really appreciate the opportunity, but I can\u2019t take over running the bathhouse. You\u2019ll have to ask someone else.\u201d\n Yuna puts her paper cup of coffee down. \u201cThat\u2019s not the answer I was expecting. Why ever not?\u201d\n \u201cI just . . . it\u2019s too much responsibility.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re the most responsible employee I have. Next.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t be around all the time, I have to take care of Yebin.\u201d\n \u201cKeep bringing Yebin to work with you\u2014it\u2019ll be your business. What else?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t even have a college degree. How am I supposed to manage this place?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ve done every single role here. Now you\u2019re just making excuses\u2014what\u2019s the real problem?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to work here forever, Yuna!\u201d\n Yuna laughs. \u201cIs that all? So run it for a couple of years and build some savings, train someone else to take over, sell it to someone new. For god\u2019s sake, Jinah, it\u2019s not a death sentence\u2014it\u2019s a business opportunity!\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Jinah says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cOh, just like I can\u2019t leave until you scrape these off me?\u201d Yuna says, gesturing to her scales.\n Jinah looks down at herself. The scales on her own arms gleam in the light.\n \u201cI get it, okay?\u201d Yuna says, voice softening slightly. \u201cI can\u2019t picture leaving. But I can imagine picturing leaving, and I like the idea of it. Think about it. My offer\u2019s still open until I go opaque. I don\u2019t want to leave this place without an owner.\u201d\n Injung visits the bathhouse that afternoon. It\u2019s only two. Jinah\u2019s arms are tired. The rush of the faux waterfall crashing into the cold pool, the bubble of the water jets in the hot bathtubs, all of this is exacerbating her tension headache. Injung lies down on the table with a big sigh.\n \u201cLong week?\u201d Jinah asks, looking over the cascade of scales creeping down Injung\u2019s shoulder blades.\n \u201cThe longest!\u201d Injung says and shifts her head to look at Jinah. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so good either. Maybe you should be the one lying here.\u201d\n \u201cSure, let\u2019s trade places,\u201d Jinah says. Injung laughs, which rattles her scales in a sinuous shiver. Jinah gets to work scrubbing.\n \u201cI\u2019m job hunting again,\u201d Injung says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go back to hairdressing. Or maybe I\u2019ll finally get that office job. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll work out this time, maybe.\u201d\n \u201cThat makes one of us.\u201d\n Injung twists around to stare at Jinah. \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n \u201cYuna offered to give me the bathhouse.\u201d\n Injung sits up, batting Jinah\u2019s hands away. She gestures at the bathing hall. \u201cYou mean thisbathhouse? The whole thing?\u201d\n \u201cThe whole thing,\u201d Jinah says. \u201cShe told me she was tired of running it, and that she wanted to retire. That\u2019s crazy, right? I can\u2019t accept this.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s a great opportunity.\u201d\n \u201cI never thought I\u2019d work here forever!\u201d Jinah says, her voice rising two octaves.\n \u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t be working, managing is totally different from working,\u201d Injung says, authoritatively. \u201cI\u2019ve done both, I\u2019d know. Don\u2019t accept it if you don\u2019t want to, but I think you should say yes.\u201d\n \u201cLie back down,\u201d Jinah says. Injung rolls her eyes and lies back down. Jinah scrubs at the scales on Injung\u2019s left bicep furiously.\n She knows the arguments that Injung might articulate. If Jinah\u2019s the owner, that\u2019s respectability, responsibility, financial stability. She wouldn\u2019t be a massage lady anymore. She could hire a new massage lady. She\u2019d be the boss, and she\u2019d have more money, more savings, more resources for Yebin.\n \u201cIt\u2019s just that there feels like there\u2019s a catch.\u201d\n \u201cSometimes good things happen, Jinah. This could be a good thing.\u201d\n \u201cI already told her no,\u201d Jinah admits. \u201cNot that Yuna accepted it.\u201d\n \u201cSee? Yuna knows that you should say yes, too. You should leave right now and go tell her, \u2018Sorry Yuna, I don\u2019t know what I was thinking earlier, I\u2019d love to own this entire bathhouse.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her after work, okay, Injung?\u201d Jinah says, just to make Injung subside. The optimism that Injung brings with her is sometimes exhausting. It reminds Jinah of herself when she was younger, or the young woman she\u2019d be without Yebin and the dead husband.\n Jinah finishes the day. She doesn\u2019t talk to Yuna about the offer. She picks Yebin up from school, and they walk to the park together while Yebin chatters about her day. Yebin is the center of her own universe, and Jinah probably shouldn\u2019t encourage that, but it\u2019s so much nicer to hear about what Yebin did at recess than it is to tell Yebin anything important. Jinah\u2019s dreading the day Yebin starts asking about her dad.\n Yebin makes a beeline for the playground, and Jinah settles on a bench to wait. When Yebin glances over, Jinah smiles and waves. Yebin beams back, waves energetically before returning to chasing another little girl around.\n There are other kids and parents here. Jinah watches them idly. The parents almost all have scales winding up their arms in varying stages of color and translucence. Some of them are perfectly opaque, but their bearers don\u2019t act any differently than those who don\u2019t have any scales. The parents push their kids on the swings. Hand out juice boxes. Mostly everyone at the park seems happy.\n Jinah always wonders what happens to her clients. The scales always grow back. But some of them, Jinah never sees again, and she wonders if their absence is because of her ministrations. She doesn\u2019t know if the future she scraped from their skin was one they wanted.\n Yebin comes running over, throwing herself into Jinah\u2019s lap. Jinah ruffles her hair. Yebin needs a haircut, it\u2019s starting to tangle. \u201cAll done playing?\u201d\n \u201cAll done!\u201d Yebin says, into Jinah\u2019s shirt, before peeking up. \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n Jinah gently moves Yebin and opens her backpack to pull out the packaged gimbap, which she opens before giving to her daughter.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d Yebin says, and stuffs a gimbap in her mouth.\n \u201cChew slowly,\u201d Jinah says, taking a water bottle out. \u201cDon\u2019t choke.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019d miss me forever if I choked,\u201d Yebin says, muffled because she\u2019s talking with her mouth full. \u201cYou\u2019d be so sad.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d be so sad,\u201d Jinah agrees. \u201cDon\u2019t talk with your mouth full. I love you.\u201d\n \u201cI love you too,\u201d Yebin says, still with her mouth full. She eats two more gimbap in quick succession.\n Jinah pours water on a washcloth. \u201cHere, let\u2019s clean your hands off.\u201d\n Yebin holds out her hands. Jinah wrings the wet towel and slides it over Yebin\u2019s palms. The scales shimmer in the light. Jinah presses harder. She turns Yebin\u2019s hands over, and scrubs, scraping the near-transparent scales from Yebin\u2019s skin.\n \u201cOw, ow,\u201d Yebin says, trying to pull her hands away.\n \u201cAlmost done,\u201d Jinah says, holding Yebin tight and cleaning up Yebin\u2019s forearm.\n \u201cOw, mom,\u201d Yebin complains again. The scales fall to the ground, little glittering fragments that dissolve in the damp grass. Her forearms and hands are raw and pink. Jinah releases her daughter.\n \u201cYebin, what do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d she asks.\n Yebin hums thoughtfully, tunelessly, used to the whims of adults and their non sequiturs. \u201cI don\u2019t know! I want to be a swimmer, but last week we learned about snorkeling. Can we go snorkeling?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe when you\u2019re older,\u201d Jinah says, feeling absurdly relieved. \u201cGo play, Yebin.\u201d\n Jinah thinks while she\u2019s hanging the laundry, while she\u2019s doing the dishes, while she\u2019s getting ready for bed and washing her face. The scales climb up her cheek, little flakes of indigo that obscure the skin underneath. Jinah catches sight of herself in the mirror and winces. She scrubs her hand across her jawline and the scales cascade into the sink. She examines her face afterward. The skin is an angry red, breaking the symmetry of her face. It\u2019s tender to the touch.\n In a way, the scales are like armor. A promise that the woman who exists in this space can do so for the rest of her life, that she doesn\u2019t need to worry about the tender uncertainty of what-ifs anymore.\n It\u2019s the what-ifs that keep Jinah up at night. What if she scrapes the scales from her skin and agrees to take over the bathhouse, runs it forever, and uses the extra money to buy Yebin swimming lessons, nicer clothes, after-school tutoring? Or what if Jinah scrapes the scales from her skin and doesn\u2019t take over the bathhouse? What if instead, she abandons her daughter, abandons the bathhouse, buys a midnight bus ticket to Busan, crushes her phone under the heel of her shoe, and changes her name and never comes back? The dream of leaving is bitter and addictive, like her coffee every morning, a ritual built into her life with routine. She wonders how much of this is innate, and how much of this is a calcification.\n She steps into her rarely used shower stall with washcloth in hand. The spray of the showerhead hurts against her abraded cheek. The heat feels good against the knots in her back.\n Jinah can\u2019t imagine a beautiful future, standing in her shower stall. Yuna can\u2019t imagine leaving the bathhouse but still imagines the possibility of imagining leaving. Injung imagines that every new future will be brighter than before, rides each choice with certainty so strong that it needs to be scraped off. Jinah wants that sort of optimism. Jinah wants to love her daughter wholeheartedly. She wants the love to be innate. She wants to believe in brighter futures. She can\u2019t imagine ever changing.\n She presses the washcloth against her forearm and scrapes. The scales slough off and melt into running water. It doesn\u2019t feel any different to have the scales removed from one arm. She thinks about Yebin cautiously, like prodding at a sore tooth. She thinks she still loves her daughter. She thinks she still wants Yebin to have swimming lessons because Yebin would enjoy them. Jinah\u2019s arm hurts. She puts the rough washcloth to her skin again and repeats the process on all her limbs, her torso, up her cheeks. It leaves the skin red underneath. When she\u2019s done, she\u2019s left breathing heavily in her shower, the hot water stinging against her abraded skin.\n She towels off. She dries her hair. She puts on her pajamas. She reads Yebin a story before bedtime. Then she makes two calls and puts her phone on the nightstand before she goes to sleep. She doesn\u2019t dream.\n Jinah walks into the empty bathhouse to find the two women she had contacted sitting in the massage area, their respective scales glinting like jewels under the light. Injung is gesturing, and Yuna is laughing, and Jinah smiles a little to see it because it means that she read their personalities correctly.\n \u201cGood morning,\u201d she says, and the women look over at her. Injung beckons her over.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s this big secret you wanted to talk to me about? Is this about your new job? Oops\u2014am I not supposed to know about that?\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re looking very fresh,\u201d Yuna says, giving Jinah a long glance over her body, eyes lingering on the long swathes of clean skin.\n \u201cI feel very fresh,\u201d Jinah says. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve met, I have a counterproposal, Yuna. You should give the bathhouse to Injung.\u201d\n Yuna stares at her. Stares at Injung. Looks back at Jinah. \u201cAre you insane? Did you scrub away all your good sense, too?\u201d\n Jinah shakes her head. \u201cNo. Let me finish. Give the bathhouse to Injung but let me manage it first. I\u2019ll teach Injung how the business runs. She already has customer service experience, retail experience, managerial experience, and she\u2019s a regular client here, so she already knows the feel of the place. I\u2019ll show her the ropes, and she\u2019ll be a wonderful manager, in a year.\u201d\n \u201cBut what do you get out of this?\u201d Injung says, as if her acceptance is already a foregone conclusion.\n Jinah takes a deep breath. \u201cIn return for my support, I\u2019d like you and the bathhouse to support me while I finish my degree.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d Injung says.\n \u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to this yet,\u201d Yuna says, but she doesn\u2019t sound angry.\n \u201cIf you\u2019ll permit me,\u201d Jinah says, and bows shallowly, the barest dip of her head. \u201cBefore you make a decision, I\u2019d like to give you that massage you asked for.\u201d\n Isabel J.

But some of the guests had seen him before, and they said he was good, lots of fun, very \u201ccurrent\u201d\u2014a joke that got more mileage than it should have.\n \u201cDo you need any kind of extension cord?\u201d the hostess, Liz Pooley, asked. She wore a skintight suit of emerald lame, and had sprayed a lightning bolt pattern in her hair, in his honor.\n Johnny Volts sighed and then smiled. They all expected him to be something like a children\u2019s magician\u2014all patter and tricks. \u201cNo extension cord,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere can I stand?\u201d He caught his hostess\u2019s frown. \u201cI need an area to work in\u2014and appliances, not plugged in. I\u2019m the plug. No microwaves. A blender, a radio, a light bulb. Christmas lights?\u201d\n The guests were charmed at first and then, inevitably, they were bored. Even if it wasn\u2019t a trick, it was pretty limited. He could power a light, but not a microwave. He could charge your cell phone but not your car. He was an early adopter of some sort, that was all; they would wait for the jazzed-up version.\n Johnny Volts had a pacemaker with a rechargeable battery, and he had a friend who was a mad scientist. This friend had added a universal bus to his battery port, and hence Johnny Volts had a cable and a convertible socket. He could plug things in; he could be plugged in. This was a parlor trick as far as the public was concerned\u2014and a strange, unsettling, but still somewhat interesting way of earning a living as far as Johnny Volts was concerned. He knew\u2014he understood\u2014that his pacemaker powered his heart, and his heart recharged the pacemaker in a lovely series of perpetual interactions. He had no issue with it.\n In Liz Pooley\u2019s party, as Johnny Volts lit a lamp, turned on a clock radio, and charged an iPod, he was watched by a frowning man in a checked shirt whose companion seemed quite happy with Johnny.\n \u201cWhy he\u2019s worth his weight in gold,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine never having to pay an electric bill.\u201d\n \u201cSmall appliances,\u201d the man grunted.\n \u201cWell now it\u2019s small appliances, Bob, but he\u2019s just the first. Wait till he can really get going, he\u2019ll have his own rocket pack. Remember rocket packs, Bob? The Segway of long-lost memory.\u201d She put her hand on Bob\u2019s arm and rolled her eyes. \u201cI was but a mere child of course, when I heard about those rocket packs. Shooting us up in the air. A new meaning to the term Jet Set, hey? Or is that phrase too old? I bet it\u2019s too old. What are we called now, Bob?\u201d She lifted her drink, saluted him, and winked.\n \u201cWe\u2019re called only when they\u2019ve run out of everyone else, Cheree.\u201d Bob was idly thinking about what would bring a man to this: plugging in small irrelevant things into his own violated flesh. \u201cIrrelevant,\u201d he said finally. \u201cThey call us irrelevant.\u201d\n Cheree frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re turning into an old man, Bob. You\u2019ve lost your spark.\u201d She gave him a small motherly peck on the cheek and walked forward, powerfully, her lemon martini firm in her hand, straight to Johnny Volts, who was looking around, waiting to be paid. \u201cYou looking for a drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cI could get you one.\u201d\n \u201cOh\u2014well, all right,\u201d he said, surprised.\n \u201cYou wait right here,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to know all about you, electric man.\u201d And she turned until she found a server and came back with a dark liquid in a tumbler. \u201cNow tell me\u2014how does it feel? I mean you\u2019re generating electricity, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n \u201cYes. Not much. After next week it should be more. I\u2019m having an upgrade.\u201d\n \u201cLovely. How does it feel? Like little bugs up and down your spine?\u201d She had a heady grin, a frank way of working. Johnny liked it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful kind of pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cIt feels like I could fill the room with it, lift everything up, kind of explode\u2014only I hold on to the explosion.\u201d His eyes got internal.\n \u201cDo you like it?\u201d\n He was open-mouthed with surprise. \u201cYes. Of course. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n She tilted her head a little, studying his face, and he found it embarrassing at first, and then he got used to it. He looked back at her, not lowering his eyes or glancing away. She was older than he was, but she had a bright engaging air about her, as if she made a point of not remembering anything bad.\n \u201cHere you go,\u201d the hostess said, her arm held out full length with a check at the end of it like a flattened appendage.\n Johnny took it and turned to leave. \u201cHey!\u201d Cheree said, grabbing at his arm a little. \u201cThat\u2019s rude. Not even a fond farewell?\u201d\n \u201cThey usually want me to leave right away,\u201d he said in explanation. \u201cBefore I get boring.\u201d\n \u201cBoring,\u201d she said companionably as they headed together for the door. \u201cThat bunch? They think other people are boring?\u201d\n He noted that she was walking along with him as if she belonged there. \u201cSo where do you see yourself in five years?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a test question. So many people can\u2019t think ahead.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think ahead?\u201d\n \u201cNot me. I\u2019m spontaneous. Then again, I\u2019m not at all electric, so I don\u2019t have to worry about running out of juice.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t run out,\u201d he said. \u201cI recharge. And I\u2019m getting an upgrade to photovoltaic cells next week. I have to decide where to implant them; do you mind if I run it past you?\u201d He rubbed his hand over his head as they took the elevator down. \u201cThe obvious thing is to replace my hair\u2014it\u2019s a bit of a jolt, though. I can lose it all and get a kind of mirror thing on top\u2014a shiny bald pate, all right. Or fiber optic hair. But it will stick out. Like one of those weird lamps with all the wires with lights at the end? What do you think?\u201d\n \u201cFiber optic hair,\u2019 she said without hesitation. \u201cAhead of the times. Fashion-forward. I bet there\u2019ll be a run on the hardware store.\u201d\n He stopped\u2014they were on the street\u2014and frowned at her. \u201cYour name?\u201d\n \u201cCheree.\u201d\n \u201cCheree, you\u2019re glib.\u201d\n \u201cI am glib, Johnny,\u201d she said in a soft voice. \u201cIt\u2019s because my head doesn\u2019t stop. You know the brain is all impulses, don\u2019t you? Bang and pop all over the place. Well, mine is on superdrive, I have to keep talking or I\u2019ll crack from all the thinking. The constant chatter . . . I can only dream of stillness.\u201d\n He shook his head in sympathy. \u201cThat sounds like static.\u201d He stopped and reached out for her hand. \u201cMaybe you produce energy all your own?\u201d She held her hand out, and Johnny hesitated, then touched the tips of their fingers together. He closed his eyes, briefly. There was a warmth, a moistness, a lovely frisson. He took a deep breath. He felt so tired after those parties, but now a delicious delicate rejuvenation spread through him. The back of his neck prickled; the hairs on his arms\u2014even his eyebrows\u2014hairs everywhere rose, he could feel it in his follicles. It rose up in him until suddenly Cheree was thrown backward slightly.\n \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she said tensely.\n He nodded. \u201cSorry. Volts. A little discharge. It won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n \u201cStill,\u201d she said uneasily. \u201cCan\u2019t say I know what to make of it.\u201d\n They were at a crossroads, specifically Houston and Lafayette. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cEast Seventh.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m uptown.\u201d They stood for a moment in silence. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d he asked finally.\n Her face broke into a smile, like a charge of sunshine.\n They were utterly charming together, they were full of sparks. Toasters popped up when they visited their friends\u2014though did people really still have toasters? Wasn\u2019t that, instead, the sound of CD players going through their disks, shuffling them? Wasn\u2019t it the barely audible purr of the fan of a car as they passed it, sitting up and noticing as if it were a dog? They were attractive, after all; they attracted.\n \u201cIf we moved in together,\u201d Johnny said after they\u2019d known each other for a month, \u201cwe\u2019d have half the bills. We could live on very little, we could live on what I make at the parties. You wouldn\u2019t have to work as a waitress. In fact, we could be free.\u201d\n \u201cAnd give up my dreams of rocket science?\u201d she asked, her eyebrows arched.\n \u201cI thought you were a waitress.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s just till I sell my first rocket.\u201d Nevertheless, she decided to move in, and it was working out fine, except for the strange way that objects behaved around them.\n Small electrics followed them like dogs sometimes\u2014they could turn down the block and hear a clanking or a scraping behind them. Eager little cell phones, staticky earphones, clicking electronic notepads gathered in piles on their doorstep.\n \u201cWe have to figure out a budget,\u201d Cheree said after she moved in. \u201cUntil I sell that rocket. Rent, not much we can do. We should get bikes, that will save on transportation. But, you know, we\u2019re still paying for electricity, and it\u2019s pretty high, too. What do we really use it for?\u201d\n Together, they went through their apartment, noting: refrigerator, lamps, clock, radio, stereo, TV, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer, iron, laptop computer.\n \u201cWell,\u201d Johnny said. \u201cAll quite useful in their own way, but we can make coffee without electricity. And I already recharge the computer myself.\u201d\n She considered it all. \u201cYou can recharge most of it, really, if we get the right kind of thing. If we look at everything that way\u2014I\u2019m sure there are rechargeable lamps, for instance\u2014why are we paying electric bills? We could save a lot of money by doing it ourselves.\u201d\n They canceled their energy provider, a savings right there of $70 a month. They would plug a different item into Johnny at night, so they would never run out. It was a brilliant solution.\n That gave him even more motivation for the photovoltaic upgrade. When he went to his mad scientist friend, she went with him, and they mentioned the strange way they seemed to be accumulating electrical appliances. The mad scientist was sitting across from them, taking down Johnny\u2019s recap of the past few months, when the scientist felt his skin begin to tingle. He shook himself briefly, as if buzzed by a fly. He was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon, a Mexican genius who did illegal cable and satellite hookups to make some money, and was always looking over his shoulder. Johnny Volts was his ticket to fame and fortune; once the process was perfect, he would offer it to a medical or electronics company and bring millions down to his hometown of Tijuana, where he would go to retire.\n The scientist ran a voltmeter over Cheree and whistled. \u201cThis is lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cExciting, even.\u201d He grinned at Johnny. \u201cShe\u2019s got a field. You see, you two match. You kind of amplify each other\u2014understand?\u201d He looked at them happily, waiting for them to catch up with his thinking. \u201cYou match.\u201d\n It took a moment. \u201cYou\u2019re saying we\u2019re related? Like siblings?\u201d\n \u201cOh\u2014no, no, I mean your energy matches. It doesn\u2019t mean anything really, other than that you\u2019re sensitive to each other\u2019s waves. You two have sympathetic electricity\u2014I\u2019m making the term up\u2014so you use less energy when you\u2019re together than you do when you\u2019re apart, because you\u2019re actually attracting each other\u2019s charge. The byproduct is, you attract things that charge. Get it?\u201d\n \u201cOh, honey, yes,\u201d Cheree said. \u201cI get it.\u201d It was like their little electric hearts went thudder-thump when they came near each other. Cheree was aware of it as a little sizzle in her brain.\n They noticed a few things: He was a thoughtless hummer, and when he hummed he gave her a headache. She was an adventurer, wanting to go out and about, here there and everywhere, while he liked to think and write and test how strong his recharging was.\n It happened gradually, the feeling that they were being watched, were being followed. She had coffee and a man who looked familiar sat opposite her in the caf\u00e9. He went to a party and saw the same man in a different suit watching him carefully. His apartment door was dusted with a fine powder one morning; the following week it was on a window.\n When they went out in the morning, there was always a bunch of people passing their front door. Jauntily, as if just interrupted, they were speeding away, towards, around, moving with a great deal more purpose than on any other block. \u201cHave you noticed it?\u201d Cheree asked, and Johnny nodded. \u201cI asked the landlord, and he said there\u2019s been some kind of gas leak, they\u2019re checking the lines a lot more. Even went into the basement, he said, all up and down the block.\u201d\n \u201cA gas leak?\u2019 she said, sniffing. \u201cI don\u2019t smell anything.\u201d\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s good then.\u201d\n But then Johnny disappeared. Went out to a party and didn\u2019t come back, and when she called the number listed in his daybook, she was told he hadn\u2019t shown up.\n Cheree buzzed in her head when she was near Johnny; she could feel the tingle coming on when she turned the corner, half a block away, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that she felt she could find him. She said to herself: these are the things I know: He has a charge, and I can sense it. He has a head of fiber optic hair. And I am his magnet.\n She took her bike and rode slowly, up and down streets, starting with the top of the island. Her head refused to buzz, block after block, in traffic and out, but then, after three hours\u2014just as she rounded the corner near the docks on the west side\u2014she heard a tang, she felt a nibble at her brain. It was him. She biked forward, back, left and right, testing out the buzzing, following it to the door of a small garage dealing in vintage cars.\n She parked her bike and chained it. She noticed an electric toothbrush rolling on the sidewalk.\n She walked up to a man in a very neat jumpsuit. She didn\u2019t know anything about vintage cars. \u201cI have to get a present for my dear old dad,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loves cars. I thought maybe we could all\u2014he had two families, so there\u2019s plenty of children\u2014get together and buy him something smashing.\u201d She grinned.\n He shrugged. \u201cYou can take a look at what we\u2019ve got, but my gut says you\u2019re out of your league.\u201d\n She smiled at him steadily, looking around, her eyes skipping to the doorway to an office or a back room. She could feel Johnny\u2019s electric kick. She walked around the cars slowly until his charge was at its strongest. She whipped around \u201cI know you have him,\u201d she said, and drew in her breath, kicking a chair over to trip him as he lunged forward. She bolted for the door, which was unlocked, and burst in.\n There was Johnny, in the corner of the room. They had him wired up to machines that beeped and spit, they had his arm strapped to a chair.\n \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d Johnny said when he saw her. She stopped, uncertainly, in the middle of the room.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n The man in the garage was behind her, and two men came at her from the side. They were all dressed in white jumpsuits, with ties showing through their zippered fronts. \u201cWe\u2019re from the collection agency,\u201d one man said. \u201cFor unlawful theft of electricity.\u201d\n \u201cWe don\u2019t need to pay for electricity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe only use our own.\u201d\n \u201cHa,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t own it. You\u2019re just stealing it and not paying it. You know what? We put meters into and out of your apartment, just to make sure. You were off the charts! We could hear the volts clicking! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not using electricity!\u201d\n \u201cI tried to explain\u2014\u201d Johnny said wearily.\n \u201cDid you plug into him yet?\u201d Cheree interrupted. \u201cThen you\u2019ll see.\u201d She looked around and picked up a small calculator on a desk, plugging it into Johnny\u2019s socket. It whirred on, but the jumpsuits looked impassive. She began to enter numbers faster and faster, until finally she rang up Total. \u201cSee?\u201d she said, as the men stepped forward almost politely, glancing at the strip of paper (who had such old calculators, anyway?) that had curled out the top.\n \u201cNice,\u201d the second man concluded. He reached into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m not with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m with NASA and we think you might have stolen a restricted project. We\u2019re going to have to take you with us for national security.\u201d He offered his card.\n \u201cHold on there,\u201d said the third man, \u201cI\u2019m with the Office of Ocean Exploration. You can\u2019t take him, see here\u2014I\u2019ve got a signed order to bring him in for questioning.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI mean it\u2019s an invitation. We admire the strides he\u2019s made in making a self-sustaining renewable resource.\u201d He gave a business card to Johnny and one to Cheree.\n The first man took out a gun. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. He\u2019s been taking electricity and we own electricity. It\u2019s that simple. You can\u2019t take him because he\u2019s going to jail, our own facilities in a state-approved housing unit until his case comes to trial.\u201d\n Johnny hung his head and groaned. \u201cI\u2019m no use to any of you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese fiber-optic hairs\u2014they\u2019re no use underwater, you know\u2014they need the sun to recharge. Totally useless.\u201d The NOAA man looked a little annoyed at that, but he said, \u201cWho said you had to be under the water; maybe they want you on top of the water?\u201d but even he looked skeptical.\n \u201cPlus, he\u2019s on a pacemaker,\u201d Cheree said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a pacemaker in orbit, if that\u2019s what you were thinking. You\u2019d kill him; what good would that be?\u201d\n The electric company man was looking increasingly smug. \u201cThat leaves me,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cAnd all I want is for the bill to be paid. Plus interest and penalties.\u201d\n \u201cThere is no bill,\u201d Johnny said wearily. \u201cWe canceled our account months ago. No account, no bills.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s not how it works. You think electricity is free? Like air? Like water? Like land? Are any of those free?\u201d He waved Cheree aside as she said \u201cAir! Air is free!\u201d\n \u201cNothing\u2019s free,\u201d he said. \u201cThe factories pay us for the air they pollute, and you have to pay for cleaning it\u2014one way or another, someone\u2019s paying for it. As for electricity, that\u2019s never been free since Franklin put a key on a chain. Right now, you\u2019re stealing our business by interfering with a regulated industry without a license. It\u2019s against the law.\u201d He looked very merry about it. \u201cI lied about our state-sanctioned facilities. You just go to jail, same as the scammers and the knockoff artists, and you can light your hair up all you want and see what it gets you!\u201d He laughed then, thinking about the possible results.\n \u201cAnd you agree with this?\u201d Cheree asked the men from NASA and NOAA. They looked at each other and shrugged. \u201cNothing in it for us,\u201d one said. \u201cWe don\u2019t interfere in the private sector,\u201d said the other.\n \u201cThen it\u2019s just you,\u201d Cheree said to the last man, who looked at the others with contempt.\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, reaching into his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable man.\u201d He held out a taser gun. \u201cAnd this is a perfectly legal means of protecting myself.\u201d\n Cheree looked at it and grinned. She glanced up and saw Johnny\u2019s face. \u201cJohnny Volts,\u201d she said, cooing to him. \u201cJohnny, sing to me!\u201d\n Johnny began to hum, and she decided to join him, sympathetically. The men in jumpsuits felt the hairs on their necks begin to rise, then their leg hairs, then their head hairs. The man from the electric company looked around wildly, then took a step towards Johnny, his taser outstretched.\n The taser suddenly snapped and shot a small series of electric arcs out into the air until the utilities man yelped and dropped it. Cheree released Johnny, who rose from his seat and said, \u201cSorry. But there was a buildup. And Cheree is an amplifier. And I think I got a shot of adrenaline or something that caused an overload.\u201d\n The other two men looked at each other. \u201cTime to go, I think,\u201d one said and the other nodded. They walked off together slowly, as if not wanting to make a sudden move.\n \u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d Johnny said to the man writhing on the floor.\n \u201cIf I could get up I\u2019d clobber you,\u201d the energy man said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t over. I\u2019ll hunt you down and do something.\u201d He panted. \u201cJust as soon as I can move again.\u201d\n They followed the mad scientist down to Mexico, all of them imagining the utilities man hot on their trail. Even Tijuana seemed unsafe, so the mad scientist took them to a small town in the mountains, where he continued his work.\n He gave Cheree a pacer, too, and he linked their charge, which was now big enough to fire a microwave, if there\u2019d been a microwave around. But they had a bigger plan. In their mad dash down to the border they\u2019d seen how much gasoline cost; wasn\u2019t Johnny the wave of the future and the future\u2019s savior? And wouldn\u2019t the mad scientist get rewards and jobs and money up the wazoo if he could find a way to recharge a car without looking for an outlet?\n He plugged Johnny into the car he rigged up and called it the Voltswagon. Johnny could only get it to move slowly at first; but once the mad scientist hooked up Cheree to Johnny, and Johnny to the car, they were able to whiz to Tijuana and back at a merry clip. It took four years, but the cars ran and Johnny and Cheree were unharmed, and the mad scientist refined the recharging process to accommodate one person for one car\n Little by little they converted the inhabitants of Tijuana to fiber optic hair and plug-in Voltswagons. Big Oil shut down the borders to keep Americans from going to Mexico to buy cars, but late at night, and hidden in the back of trucks, Americans snuck across the border to buy their Voltswagons and bring them home.\n Karen Heuler's stories appear in literary, fantasy, and science fiction magazines regularly and have won various awards, including an O.

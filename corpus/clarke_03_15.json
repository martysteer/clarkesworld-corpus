Throughout the month, several stories temporarily held the top spot, but when we closed the winners revealed themselves to be:\n2nd Place (tie)\n\u201cPassage of Earth\u201d by Michael Swanwick\n\u201cThe Eleven Holy Numbers of the Mechanical Soul\u201d by Natalia Theodoridou\n3rd Place (tie)\n\u201cTortoiseshell Cats Are Not Refundable\u201d by Cat Rambo\n\u201cPatterns of a Murmuration, In Billions of Data Points\u201d by JY Yang\nBest 2014 Clarkesworld Cover Art\nWhile almost every piece of cover art found praise from some segment of our community, the top three places established themselves very early and held their place through the entire month. The winners are:\nCongratulations to all our winners and a big thank you to everyone that participated in this year\u2019s poll.\nWhile we\u2019re recognizing the accomplishments of some of our authors, I\u2019d like to toss a few more congratulations to this year\u2019s Nebula Award nominees. SFWA announced the final slate in February and I\u2019m very happy to see two Clarkesworld stories and one from Upgraded on the ballot.\nShort Story Nominee\n\u201cThe Meeker and the All-Seeing Eye\u201d by Matthew Kressel\nNovelette Nominee\n\u201cThe Magician and Laplace\u2019s Demon\u201d by Tom Crosshill\nNovella Nominee\n\u201cThe Regular\u201d by Ken Liu (from Upgraded)\nSpeaking of \u201cThe Regular,\u201d you can also read this novella in the debut issue of Forever, a new all-reprint science fiction magazine that will feature a novella and two short stories in each monthly issue. You won\u2019t find Forever online or in print, but you can get the ebook editions of the first issue available for free on my blog. Please download and give our first issue a try. If you enjoy it, I hope you\u2019ll consider subscribing at Amazon, Weightless, or direct from our website.\nIn last month\u2019s editorial, I outlined several of our goals for the next six months. All of these things were tied to being able to increase subscriptions, Patreon and Joyride support, and advertising. None of these things are easy, but I\u2019m pleased to say that last month we reached a new Patreon goal, unlocking three more original stories for the 2015 calendar. With luck, we can build upon that success and continue to move this publication forward.\nThank you and have a great month!\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

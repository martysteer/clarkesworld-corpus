Ostap walked the honeycomb paving with his hands in his pockets, head and shoulders above the scurrying students. They were starting to ping him as he passed, raking after his social profile until he could feel the accumulated electronic gaze like static. Ostap had everything shielded, as was his agent\u2019s policy, but that didn\u2019t stop them from recognizing his pale face, buzzed head, watery blue eyes.\n A few North Korean transfers, who\u2019d been in the midst of mocapping a rabbit, started shrieking as they caught sight of him. The game was up. Ostap flashed his crooked grin, the most-recognized smile in athletics and possibly the world, and by the time he was at the Old Sciences building he had a full flock. The students were mostly discreet with their recording, not wanting to seem too eager for celebspotting points, but Ostap could tell they were waiting for something as he walked up the concrete wheelchair ramp.\n \u201cAccra 2036,\u201d he said, linking his fingers for the Olympic rings. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it all, right?\u201d\n Ostap let one massive palm drift along the rail, then flipped himself up and inverted to walk it on his hands. The flock cheered him all the way up the rail and applauded when he stuck the twisting dismount. Ostap gave them a quick bow, then turned through the doors and into the hall. The sudden hushed quiet made him feel like he was in a cathedral.\n Bioscientist-now-professor Dr. Alyce Woodard had a new office, but Ostap had expected that. He\u2019d never grown attached to the old one, not when their few visits there were so engulfed by the days and nights in the labs, in temperature-controlled corridors and stark white rooms where the fluorescents scoured away shadows and secrets.\n What Ostap hadn\u2019t expected was how old Alyce had become. Her spine had a desk-chair curvature as she got up and crossed the floor, pausing the wallscreen with a wave of her hand. Her body fat sagged, her eyes were bagged. Ostap remembered her beautiful, and awful, an angel\u2019s face floating above him with cold marble eyes and checklist questions. But that was before a long succession of tanned bodies and perfect teeth, and maybe she\u2019d never been at all.\n \u201cO,\u201d Alyce said, thin arms around his midsection just briefly. \u201cThanks for coming short notice.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cGood to come back.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t; he felt like he was twenty-three again, stick-thin, draped boneless in a wheelchair.\n \u201cTraining for Accra, now, huh?\u201d Alyce scratched at her elbow. \u201cAnd a citizen, this time around. I just saw the new ads, they\u2019re still using that clip from the 2028 Games . . . \u201d She waved the wallscreen to play, and Ostap saw himself loping out onto the track, blinking in the sunlight, fins of plastic and composite gleaming off his back and shoulders. It was the 7.9 seconds that had put the name Ostap Kerensky into every smartfeed, his events plastered on billboards and replayed ad nauseam on phones and tablets.\n \u201cThe dash,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cThey really don\u2019t get tired of it.\u201d\n \u201cEight years on, you\u2019d think they would,\u201d Alyce said. Her smile was terse, but she watched, too. A cyclopean Pole, six foot five, noded spine, and long muscled limbs. No warm-up, no ritual. On the gunshot he came off the blocks like a Higgs boson.\n \u201cThe tracking camera fucking lost him,\u201d Alyce quoted, because the commentators had long since been censored out. \u201cIt really fucking lost him.\u201d\n \u201cThat was some year,\u201d Ostap said, trying to read her, but the new lines on her face made it harder, not easier.\n She flicked the wallscreen to mute. \u201cI saw the feed of that promotion you did in Peru, too.\u201d Alyce was looking up and down him. \u201cExhibition match, or something? With that football club?\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re hoping to open up the league to biomods next season, yeah.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d Her face was blank.\n \u201cThe underground stuff is killing their ratings,\u201d Ostap explained, to be explaining. \u201cNobody wants to watch pure sport any more. You know how it is. Blood doping, steroids, carbon blades, and now biomods: that\u2019s what gets specs. I was talking to the\u2014\u201d\n \u201cO.\u201d Alyce clenched, unclenched her teeth.\n \u201cYeah?\u201d Ostap\u2019s voice was quieter than he wanted it.\n \u201cDo you remember when we stopped doing the scans together? It was about five years back.\u201d\n Ostap remembered. He\u2019d been on the new suborbital from Dubai to LAX, struggling to fit the scanner membranes over all of his nodes with the seat reclined and Dr. Woodard chatting in his ear. He\u2019d just climbed a high-rise, one of those sponsored publicity stunts, like the company who wanted him to run the Tour de France on foot. That offer was still sitting in the backlog waiting for a green light.\n He\u2019d been tired.\n \u201cI want to see you,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sick of the cams, O,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cYou bring them like fucking flies. Just talk to me.\u201d\n So he had, about the dark-haired girls in barely-shirts and tight cigarette jeans, the cosmetically-perfected lips and tits, the girls who\u2019d mobbed him at the airport. They all would have killed for a night of his time.\n \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Alyce had said, when he was finished. \u201cStill.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sending the scan,\u201d Ostap had said, because he had nothing else she wanted. He\u2019d sent it before the suborbital peaked and the conversation crackled away, and after that, the conversations stopped.\n \u201cI remember,\u201d Ostap said now, unsmiling. \u201cWe set it up to automate.\u201d\n Alyce moved to sit back against the desk, her hands veiny on the wood. \u201cYou look fine,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cYou don\u2019t even look thirty-three.\u201d Ostap watched her mouth tightening.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cThe augs are asking too much, O.\u201d Alyce put a finger to her ribs. \u201cThe stress on your central nervous system, your organs. It\u2019s been increasing. They\u2019re all on their way out. Heart first, I\u2019d think.\u201d She was not wincing, not looking away. \u201cTwo more years is the projected max.\u201d\n Ostap felt the nodes like he hadn\u2019t since the surgeries, felt the pulse of them deep in flesh. He felt the composite wrapping his spine, the membranes skimming under his skin, the fish-scale vents on his back and shoulders and neck. He felt the thrumming power, but now like a venom sack set to burst.\n \u201cShit,\u201d he said. \u201cShit.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cHave you experienced anything?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t think so.\u201d But it was hard to tell, now, hard to tell when his heart was skipping from blowing doxy rails, from adrenal rush, from a woman with the biomod fetish exploring every micrometer of his visible augs. The Superman was supposed to be invulnerable.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think so?\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ostap snapped. \u201cHow am I supposed to fucking know, Dr. Woodard?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to call her that, but it came out on its own, like she was still the blue fairy in his ear whispering him through operation after operation as they flayed his nerves bare. She didn\u2019t know he still dreamed about the final surgery, the sounds of scraping bone and machine.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, O.\u201d\n Hell, the kind Hieronymus Bosch would have painted, eighteen excruciating hours of laser-guided scalpels and winches and needles. Under for some of it, locally anaesthetized for the rest. Needles in his skin and breathing tubes speared down his throat. He\u2019d thought that had been price enough.\n \u201cHow long have you known for?\u201d Ostap finally asked.\n \u201cThat it was a possibility, since the start. That it was happening?\u201d Alyce paused. \u201cA long time.\u201d She folded her arms and it made her look small. \u201cShould I have told you?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Ostap said, but he wasn\u2019t sure. The slogan for the 2036 Games was looping endlessly across the wallscreen. Legends are made in America.\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n Ostap put his hand up to his skull. \u201cSo why now?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy are you telling me now?\u201d\n The game in Peru, when he\u2019d struck a volley out of the air for the first time and buried it back-corner, like he\u2019d done it all his life, quick-synch nerves of his leg loaded with new muscle memories. On the bench it had gone numb for just a second, from his knee down.\n \u201cThis fucking doctorate student got into my web-cache,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how, I thought it was all airtight. She found the records. The story\u2019s going to break in a couple hours.\u201d\n \u201cAlright,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cAlright.\u201d\n \u201cSorry, O.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Ostap asked.\n Alyce gave a helpless shrug. \u201cThere are tests,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are possibilities. Options. I\u2019ve still got full access to the biolabs.\u201d\n Ostap left the office without saying goodbye. Digital maps to expensive hotels were already scrawling over his retinas, reminding him of their impeccable service, their luxury suites. He\u2019d thought he would be here for a few days, maybe, a few days to catch up after so many years. He\u2019d imagined walking with her on the steep, rough river trails and catching her if she slipped.\n Outside there was a student who wanted to speak Polish with him, whose shirt scrolled a list of Ostap\u2019s world records down his back. Ostap mumbled a few words, shook his sweat-slick hand. Others were clutching fake memorabilia and raving about things he barely remembered doing. A few girls were fluffing fingers through sun-blonde hair, casually rolling waistbands lower on their hips, pursing their lips, and trying to figure out bedroom eyes.\n He went past them all like a zombie, and walked all the way to the university bus station before he remembered he\u2019d ordered an autocab.\n Twenty minutes later Ostap pushed into the lobby through a crush of mobbers, the ones who\u2019d used complex algorithms to predict his preferred hotel, and there he had the privilege of watching the story break in real time. The alert blinked yellow onto their retinas, vibrated tablets or phones for the migraine-prone and slow adopters, and small worlds turned upside down one by one. It shuddered through the jerseys and 3D-print face masks and groping hands like a wave. Ostap would have been reading it himself if he hadn\u2019t put up a datablock.\n Silence and exclamations of disbelief started flickering back and forth like a light switch.\n \u201cYour finger here, sir,\u201d said the shell-shocked concierge, holding out the pad for a signature. He had enough presence of mind to pretend it didn\u2019t work, necessitating a fresh pad and leaving him with a small slice of Ostap Kerensky\u2019s genetic material to slip into his pocket. Ostap knew all about that trick, but he didn\u2019t give a cheerful wink or offer a hangnail. Not this time.\n The whisper-silent elevator took him to the very top, and when the wallscreens in his suite flicked on to greet him, the story was everywhere. He told them to mute, but he still watched. Pictures of Alyce skittered around the room, her mouth in a deep frown, and Ostap could tell from the selection that the current spin was villain, deceiver. He saw footage of himself zipping into a custom wet suit, rubbing petroleum jelly over his hands and cheekbones, flashing the cams a thumbs up before he waded into the water to set the new English Channel record.\n Back to the 2028 Games again, when Ostap took the world by storm. 100 meter, 200 meter. High-jump. Still enough in the tank for decathlon. Bolt\u2019s records were gone, Sterling\u2019s record was shattered. Ostap watched it all flash by in sound bites, his story condensed for anyone living under a particularly large rock.\n An incredibly promising young athlete, all but scouted from the womb, left crippled by a three-car collision when the driving AI in a cab glitched. A brilliant developer, born and bred for MIT, spearheading a team designing the most comprehensively integrated body augmentation the world had ever seen.\n They\u2019d found each other across the ocean, and it was so fucking perfect.\n The sky was growing dark and the clips were starting to recycle when Alyce buzzed in his ear. He could barely hear her, even with voice ID.\n \u201cThey were waiting at my fucking house,\u201d she said, and then the next part got swallowed.\n \u201cThey\u2019re here, too,\u201d Ostap said. He\u2019d seen it on the screen, the termite swarm of reporters and spectators milling the base of the hotel.\n \u201cSo am I,\u201d she said. \u201cWant to let me up before they crucify me?\u201d\n Ostap crossed to the balcony, palmed the glass door open. It looked like a party. People were all slammed up against each other, twisting and turning for better angles, cams flashing pop-pop-pop in the dark, hot white, miniature supernovas. He couldn\u2019t see Alyce struggling through the crowd from her cab, not at this height, but he could tell where she was by the ripples. She\u2019d barely made it five meters.\n He called the hotel security detail to go bring her in, and ten minutes later she slumped through the door, hair tendrilled with static across her face. She held up a bottle of Cannonball and sloshed it pointedly with a quarter of a smile.\n \u201cProbably safer here than anywhere else,\u201d she said, while Ostap retrieved two glasses from the designer coffee table.\n \u201cProbably, yeah. They\u2019re going to be burning cars soon.\u201d\n \u201cYou left before I could explain everything.\u201d Alyce handed the bottle over. Ostap pushed the cork with his fingertip until it plopped out and splashed down, bobbing in the wine like a buoy. She poured.\n \u201cI thought maybe you called me for something else,\u201d Ostap said. He kept his eyes off the bed.\n \u201cPeople only call Superman when there\u2019s trouble, O.\u201d Alyce took a slug of the wine and swished it in her mouth. Swallowed. \u201cThey never call him to say everything\u2019s great, you should come visit.\u201d\n \u201cThey should,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cThey used to. We used to just visit.\u201d\n \u201cIf you want to call it that,\u201d Alyce said, but there was a flush in the tips of her ears that wasn\u2019t from the wine. She handed him the other glass.\n \u201cThe first time we fucked was one week after I learned to walk. To the day.\u201d Ostap tried to laugh. \u201cDid you know that? I mean, what kind of Oedipal shit is that?\u201d\n Twitching his toes in the recovery room had been euphoria, standing on his own two feet, Elysium. As soon as he was cleared, he\u2019d spent every second he could with the harness, tottering on a treadmill as his new nerves carved channels of motion and memory. One night Dr. Woodard had stayed with him, to show him where else his new nerves led.\n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my calendar,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cIt just happened.\u201d\n And it had been over quickly, a confusion of sweat and heat that had nothing methodical, nothing logical about it. She hadn\u2019t nodded thoughtfully or dashed notes on her tablet afterward.\n \u201cNasty, brutish, and short,\u201d was what she\u2019d said, but smiling, wriggling back into her jeans. She\u2019d put her hands around Ostap\u2019s hips, where scars were still tender.\n \u201cI\u2019ve had dreams about you,\u201d Ostap had replied, but in Polish, so she wouldn\u2019t know.\n \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just a narcissist,\u201d Alyce said now, to her wine glass. \u201cMaybe Michelangelo wanted Il David.\u201d\n \u201cYou should have just let me find out on the fucking net,\u201d Ostap said.\n \u201cShould I leave?\u201d Alyce asked.\n She sat on the hotel bed, rumpling crisp white sheets, and Ostap sat on the floor with his head leaned back against its foot. The wine was clinging in his dry mouth.\n The last time he\u2019d been in this city, every day had been stronger and faster and smoother. The augs had been synchronizing, the protein pumps sculpting muscles layer by layer. His new size had had him ducking under doorways and cramming into cars. They\u2019d flown a redeye back to Warsaw for the final stretch of treatments, for last calibrations and probes and to finally see his mother and father. He hadn\u2019t been in Boston since.\n \u201cMy parents,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell them.\u201d\n \u201cWhere are they now?\u201d Alyce asked.\n \u201cLa Rochelle. Moved them there a few years ago.\u201d He tipped his head back. \u201cThey always wanted to holiday there. I think they\u2019re happy.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re old you deserve to be happy. You\u2019ve put up with enough shit.\u201d\n You\u2019re old, Ostap wanted to say. He wanted to ask her if she was happy.\n \u201cMaybe they are, maybe they\u2019re not,\u201d he said instead. \u201cI\u2019m wrong about that. Sometimes. I mean, I thought you and me were happy.\u201d\n \u201cWe were,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cBecause we were riding a whirlwind, O. You know, the parties and the galas and the fashion consultants and booking agents. All those interviews. Hell, I even wore a dress.\u201d\n \u201cI remember,\u201d Ostap said. He\u2019d worn a tailored suit, slashed in such a way as to display the nodes along his spine, and in a matter of weeks everyone wore them that way. \u201cMovie stars and moguls,\u201d he said. \u201cThat night in Chicago.\u201d\n \u201cRome, Dubai, New York.\u201d Alyce shrugged. \u201cThey blend.\u201d\n \u201cChicago, when the Superman thing was just taking off,\u201d Ostap pressed, because it was important somehow, important that she remember that one drunken night in Chicago they\u2019d spent roving through the city in an autocab, searching for a phone booth. There were none left, so they\u2019d ended up tinting the windows instead.\n \u201cWe had a good run,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cAnd that year. Well. I\u2019ll always remember that year.\u201d\n They were quiet for a moment, listening to what sounded like a full riot outside, hoarse screaming and one looping police siren. Ostap had turned the wallscreens off, but he could guess what was happening. He could guess that his net implant would be overloaded with calls, messages, demands when he lifted the block.\n \u201cWhat are they saying?\u201d he finally asked. \u201cI blocked the feed.\u201d\n \u201cAll the classics.\u201d Alyce moved the dregs of her glass in a slow circle, tipping it just so. \u201cNeo-reactionists flaring up all over. Abomination. Playing God. Things like that.\u201d\n \u201cPlaying Frankenstein,\u201d Ostap said, and felt a dull triumph when her face went red.\n \u201cYeah. All those.\u201d\n \u201cIt won\u2019t change anything,\u201d he said, then, when she looked at him shrewdly: \u201cIt won\u2019t stop biomods. Developers will still be going after full integration.\u201d He paused. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ll look at safer designs. Learn from your mistake.\u201d\n \u201cSafety isn\u2019t even in the equation when they\u2019ve already killed a dozen candidates under Beijing. But they\u2019re still only seeing success with the partial augs.\u201d She reached for the bottle on the nightstand. \u201cWe were lucky with you, O. You might be the first, best. Last.\u201d\n \u201cDo you remember the last time we talked face to face?\u201d Ostap asked. \u201cAfter your symposium.\u201d\n \u201cWhy are we talking about all this, O?\u201d\n \u201cBecause I always thought there would be time later.\u201d\n \u201cThere will be,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cI told you. There are options.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m grabbing some air,\u201d Ostap said. He got up and walked to the wide window. He thought about two years as his hands found the cool glass, thought about two winging orbits of the planet around its sun. The door slid open and he stepped out onto the balcony, feeling stucco under his bare feet. The night air was cool and flapped at his clothes, slipped over his buzzed skull. The cityscape lights were like fractured stars.\n The last time they\u2019d spoken face-to-face, she\u2019d pushed his lips off her neck and tightened her scarf.\n \u201cIt cheapens our accomplishment,\u201d she\u2019d explained. \u201cPeople are saying things, O. Finally built a better vibrator. They said that.\u201d Her face had been red and angry in the dark.\n \u201cI don\u2019t give a shit,\u201d he\u2019d said.\n \u201cFrankenstein didn\u2019t make the monster so he could put his dick in it.\u201d\n Ostap had had nothing to say to that, even though every part of Alyce shrank, apologetic and ashamed, a heartbeat after. He still didn\u2019t.\n Someone had floated up a cam on a helium sack, drifting level with the balcony, and now it started to whirr and flash. Ostap looked down and saw its laser light playing across his chest, tracking every twitch like a sniper\u2019s scope. He thought of hurling his empty glass with perfect velocity, smashing it against the cam to rain tiny fragments down into the street. They would love that.\n The carmine dot skittered across his arm, up his neck. Ostap went back inside, sliding the door shut behind him.\n The wine was nearly gone when Ostap came back in. Alyce had left just a sliver in the bottom of the bottle, as she\u2019d always done, to avoid the feeling she was drinking too much. She had her arms crossed, pacing back and forth with just a hint of unsteadiness.\n \u201cLike I said, if we shut everything down right now, if we power down your augs and get you to the labs, your chances are good,\u201d she was saying. \u201cWe can figure out what can be removed. What can\u2019t. We\u2019ll get you on dialysis, an arti-heart . . . \u201d\n \u201cYou came and sat with me in recovery,\u201d Ostap said. \u201cAfter every surgery. You always smelled like, uh, like hand sanitizer.\u201d\n \u201cYou said I had coffee breath,\u201d Alyce said, stopping.\n \u201cThat too, yeah. Black coffee and hand sanitizer.\u201d Ostap paused. \u201cAfter the last surgery, you showed me those Michelangelo paintings. Hellenic ideals, you talked about. All those trapezoids and abdomens.\u201d\n \u201cAnatomically impossible, of course,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cAll those opposing muscles groups flexing simultaneously. But beautiful.\u201d\n Ostap remembered how she\u2019d dug further through the images, blowing up Grecian statues on the wall. A wasteland of cracked marble, mythological figures missing limbs, noses, genitals. She\u2019d plucked at her throat with one finger, and murmured that it was too bad, how even gods decayed.\n \u201cYou never asked me about the accident,\u201d Ostap said, taking the wine bottle by the neck. \u201cNot once in all these years.\u201d\n Alyce shook her head.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Ostap asked, starting to pour, millimeter precise. \u201cYou\u2019re a doctor. I know you\u2019ve seen GBS before. You knew the spinal damage wasn\u2019t trauma.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Alyce agreed. \u201cYours looked early. Probably all but from birth, right?\u201d\n \u201cWhy?\u201d Ostap repeated. \u201cYou had other candidates. Plenty of candidates. You had to know those tapes were doctored. That the accident story was bullshit.\u201d\n \u201cI guess I wanted to make something from nothing.\u201d\n Ostap\u2019s fingers tightened and a crack squealed through the bottle. Two droplets squeezed out and bloomed red on the carpet. He set the wine bottle down, delicate. \u201cHow God did it?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cHow God happened,\u201d Alyce said. \u201cWe might have had better results with another candidate. We\u2019ll never know. But you were perfect, O. You wanted it. No matter what happened.\u201d\n Ostap realized the wine was blurring her, smoothing the lines in her face, making her look almost how she did before.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d he said, because the only time he\u2019d said it to her he was translating for his silver-haired father, who\u2019d been sobbing too hard for software to understand.\n \u201cWhatever you decide.\u201d She put her hand flat against his ribs, where organs ready to crumble did their work under skin so thin, no composite casing. He looked at her lined mouth. Graying hair. He looked at the hand on his flesh, their two bodies contrasted.\n \u201cIt was anatomically impossible,\u201d he said.\n \u201cBut beautiful.\u201d\n Ostap undid the block and his head was a sudden deluge, blinking messages and interview probes and priority tags. He raked through the backlog of business.

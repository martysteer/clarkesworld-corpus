If I\u2019d known, I would have requested sturdier flour\u2014we\u2019ll be waiting six years for the next transport pod. Agosti told me today my bread\u2019s good for massaging the gums, like he was trying to focus on the positives. Woods threatened to arrest him anyway, which was nice of him.\n But that\u2019s really the only thing that makes me sad. Otherwise, I promise, I\u2019m getting along here very well. I miss you, too. Every time I\u2019m up late with the dough I imagine you\u2019re at the table working, and when I look up it takes me a second to remember. But everyone here is pitching in. Marquez and Perlman and I are figuring out how to cheat an apple tree into producing fruit sooner, and Agosti\u2019s building equipment out of our old life support systems. If it works out, we\u2019ll have our own cider in two years. (\u201cWe can dip the bread in it,\u201d Perlman said, and Woods threatened to arrest her, too. Gives him something to do. Imagine being in charge of five people. Good thing he has a knack for building.)\n The sun\u2019s different than back home\u2014they told us about particles and turbulence on the way over and I was too stupid to understand it and too afraid to tell them, so just pretend I explained and you were really impressed. The planet\u2019s locked, so there\u2019s really only water on the equator\u2014nothing makes it toward the sun and it\u2019s ice by the time you go ten miles further darkside. You\u2019re never 100% sure what time it even is, except that it\u2019s a little more purple in the daylight for the hour we get it, and at sunset it looks like the whole place was attacked by vampires. It\u2019s sunset most of the time. That\u2019s not too bad if you can just avoid the river; that river never looks right with the dark coming in.\n Agosti and Perlman were up until 3:30 shouting about which route will get us over the mountains, which would be more understandable if there were any mountains. But the movie bank\u2019s still broken, so it\u2019s just as well. I\u2019m betting on Perlman. If anyone could lead us over imaginary mountains, it\u2019s her.\n My other entertainment is staying up late, trying to fight the water and make bread that will actually rise, and the bird that sings all night. Samara\u2014Perlman\u2014says we\u2019re not supposed to assign characteristics from home to the things we find here until they\u2019ve been observed and documented and whatever else, but\u2014thrush family.\n It\u2019s most active during our night hours, and we\u2019re working on why (trying to make sure it\u2019s not drawn to the lights we brought with us, which would be bad news), but in the meantime it seems happy to sit in the trees outside the kitchen and sing. Three little bursts, then a longer one that\u2019s so many notes it sounds like showing off, then a little pause to see if anyone\u2019s listening, so it\u2019s definitely showing off. If I whistle anything, it tries to repeat it, and it\u2019s a fairly good mimic, but nothing I do really takes. It knows what it likes.\n It has the same woodwind sound as the one back home, the house I lived in when I was young. Hermit thrush? Wood thrush? Something I used to hear all the time and never thought about, of course. Good news is that now it\u2019s just me and this one bird and I\u2019ll get to start over again with every new animal. This time I\u2019m going to pay better attention.\n Perlman will officially name it\u2014they don\u2019t ask the cooks how to classify animal species, that\u2019s why the company hauled a biologist out here. But Perlman knows I like it, so maybe she\u2019ll consult me. I know it best. That should count for something.\n All my love.\n Proxima Centauri Personnel Status Report: Day 1187Author: Dr. Samara Perlman\n Crew Health: Reiterating that as a biologist, I am not in a position to diagnose or treat any major medical issues, am not sure how I was tasked with this position, and am deeply concerned about how soon we can expect a qualified physician rather than a group of people who had slapdash medic training for three days before they left Earth. That said, all six residents currently seem in good health. Carlos Marquez claims a slight cough, but as the scans came back negative, my money\u2019s on allergies. If he dies of tuberculosis next week we\u2019ll know I was wrong.\n Crew Injuries: Anthony Agosti nursing a minor wrist sprain after having punched a wall. Should he resort to violence again I\u2019ll be sending him to Officer Woods for a formal report and some time in the brig. We shouldn\u2019t build a new planet with the same problems as the old one.\n Crew Mental Health: Marie Roland continues to claim she can\u2019t see the mountains to the northwest of Themis. No other signs of psychosis appear, and when questioned or shown pictures of the mountains, Roland becomes distracted and mildly agitated. No tendency to violence. Suspect a minor mental block prevents her from fully acknowledging the terrain\u2014homesickness? For now, as she\u2019s still willing to train for the mission, there seems to be no point in forcing the issue; have asked Woods to stop pushing it and will let Marie come to it in her own time.\n Crew Mission Training: Expedition prep continues. Entire staff follow regimen of five-kilometer runs on hilly terrain every morning, weight lifting three times a week, rock climbing on nearby hills twice a week. Once the snow melts a little off the pass we\u2019ll be able to determine the actual level of dexterity required for the climb and train accordingly. Vigil until then.\n to whomever\n there\u2019s nothing here left to build and the mountain project is on hold until the thaw and I don\u2019t care about sunset please get the movie bank going again before I throw myself in the river full stop\n anthony\n to whomever\n there\u2019s nothing here left to build and the mountain project is on hold until the thaw and I don\u2019t care about sunset please get the movie bank going again before I throw myself in the river full stop\n anthony\n sorry sent it twice by mistake\n wouldn\u2019t do that kind of thing if the movie bank worked though probably\n anthony\n Samara and I did a perimeter walk today, a kilometer out from the camp. I picked almost more plants than I could carry, and I\u2019m fairly sure at least half are edible, which will make meals much more exciting. Samara insisted on running tests for poison, don\u2019t worry, but I think if I have to measure one more judicious use of dried black pepper I\u2019m going to scream. I want something that tastes like it grew in the ground.\n Samara\u2019s amazing. I don\u2019t even remember first meeting her; it just feels like I\u2019ve always known her, which I guess is what close quarters will do to you. We cataloged five species of bird (none of them my bird, so I guess the animals here really can tell day from night and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll get used to), and she spent a lot more time with insects than I was interested in.\n The air here smells just like home. I don\u2019t know why\u2014the water\u2019s different, so the soil should be different, but it smells exactly like the dirt from my grandmother\u2019s garden. It helps stop me from getting lonely, that the soil here might be the same as what we left behind.\n Marquez showed us pictures of his children a few nights ago; it\u2019s his daughter\u2019s birthday. Samara cried, but nobody pushed it. It\u2019s strange how much we left behind to be here, and I think no matter how much work you\u2019re getting done, sometimes it just hits you how separate you are. We must have really wanted this. I must still.\n I know you weren\u2019t ready, and you might never be ready. These letters aren\u2019t meant to convince you, I promise. It just makes me feel closer to home.\n All my love\u2014\n Dr. March:\n Mixed results, as always. Sunset was a little longer than yesterday, so the seasons function is working. None of the subjects have noticed yet that Vivian and Carlos are interfaces, which bodes well for long-term use of constructed intelligence inside Themis. (Suggest we minimize the rock-climbing training until we can work out the uncanny valley problem in the weight distribution. Can the development team extend the thaw?) But overall, investors should be pleased\u2014let me know if you need any demo footage, I have a clip of everyone working on the gardens that should go over well.\n Technical glitch, first incident: Anthony\u2019s punch should have broken his hand. I\u2019m not sure if the safety settings are appropriately set or too schoolmarmy. We might need to dial them down and get someone to break their leg as a test run for more realistic game play.\n Gigantic fucking technical glitch, ongoing: Marie can\u2019t see the mountains. I\u2019ve checked her equipment, and there\u2019s no other potential hardware problems (attached is the most recent server diagnostic for your review, but there\u2019s nothing in it that would account for it). Either she has an actual mental block that we can\u2019t do anything about, or there\u2019s a subjectivity issue somewhere in the code for Themis and we have to find it and fix it. I can\u2019t tell which one is more likely, because you made me military instead of medical and I can\u2019t just put her in jail until she tells me she sees them. Do we have a timetable for getting security clearance on that or are we going to have to settle for imperfect data?\n -Woods\n Woods dropped into the chair in Benjamina\u2019s cubicle so hard her BIRDS OF MONTANE ECOSYSTEMS reference chart came loose and sank to the floor.\n \u201cYou gotta fix those mountains,\u201d he said.\n \u201cMy chart, please.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to break the sim,\u201d he said, scooping it up and smoothing a bent edge. \u201cWe\u2019ll have done four years of work for nothing because Marie has some synapse you can\u2019t outsmart.\u201d\n \u201cThe problem\u2019s her head, not the software.\u201d After a pointed pause, she turned around. He carried some ego out of a Themis session and it took a day or so to wear off; the faster you could remind him that everyone else was actually busy, the better. \u201cYou can see the mountains when you\u2019re in Themis, and you know they\u2019re not there. Sounds like you should take it up with the psych team.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019d have thought you wanted to keep her out of all that.\u201d He wasn\u2019t quite threatening her; he wasn\u2019t quite sympathizing. (The reason Woods got chosen for beta-test jobs was how good he could be at Not Quite.)\n Benjamina didn\u2019t bother to recite any anonymity bullshit. Woods had been in Themis a long time; they read letters out loud to each other. He knew what she sounded like. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying.\u201d\n \u201cThey want to test the mountains before we wrap beta.\u201d\n \u201cWe need to look at her file\u2014I can\u2019t reverse engineer a synapse misfire.\u201d\n \u201cThey fixed Agosti\u2019s color blindness.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s different,\u201d said Benjamina, picking crumbs off her keyboard. She didn\u2019t like that fix, for no particular reason. It was productive; it just itched.\n \u201cListen, I like her, but this is going to kill the beta, and you and I will be under the knife.\u201d\n \u201cGet the psych team to request Marie\u2019s file from the warden. Is Perlman at the same place?\u201d\n \u201cNah, Perlman stabbed her husband, she went someplace serious. Roland\u2019s just in a prison for fuckups.\u201d\n \u201cFine. So get Dr. March to show me the file. I can port into Carlos for eyes on the ground. Then I\u2019ll know what I\u2019m dealing with.\u201d\n \u201cNobody in this building\u2019s willing to talk to the shrinks but me. That should tell you something.\u201d Woods stood up, the little bird poster still in his hands. He was holding the very edges, like it was an expensive library book.\n One of the things nobody at Othrys talked about was that the longer you spent in Themis, the weirder physical objects were when you came back. Officially, nobody was talking about it because it was just Woods, and no one liked Woods enough to make him for a martyr of motor-skill dissociation. Unofficially, nobody wanted to think Themis came back with you. Benjamina hoped that wore off, too.\n \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d\n He was smoothing the edges of the chart with the pads of his fingers as he set it down. He looked up at her like he was surprised.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to go eat some decent bread,\u201d he said finally, and left.\n Benjamina\u2019s computer pinged. It was waiting for her letter.\n Agosti came back from his walk today and did some very elaborate hand gestures about how much snow is left on the mountain pass and pointing to the northwest, and it took me three minutes to realize it wasn\u2019t a buildup to a jerkoff joke. Those fucking mountains. Woods told him to knock it off\u2014very sheriffy thing to do, glad he\u2019s finding something to lay down the law about\u2014but still. It gets old.\n Samara named that bird Catharus rolandus. It\u2019s useless to be proud of something that has so little to do with actual contributions from you, but I teared up anyway. Plus that genus is apparently very close to the wood thrush after all! I felt like a scientist! Then I baked a shitty loaf of bread and lost that feeling immediately, because a scientist would know how to outsmart this water.\n I loved your letter. Not the markets, though\u2014Themis is really good for reminding you of the value of only knowing a few people. The only thing I miss about the night markets is the two of us wearing those giant sweaters with the huge arms we bought as a joke and ended up needing that whole winter and we had to push the sleeves up before we reached for anything. All the fabrics here are sort of flat. They keep you warm, but it\u2019s not the same.\n All my love\n Mr. Collins:\n My name is Dr. Frederick March, and I\u2019m a consulting psychologist for Othrys Games. We\u2019ve been partnering with your institution to test the latest game from Othrys; I understand you might not have all the details of how the process has gone so far, so first of all, I wanted to thank you, and let you know it\u2019s been invaluable. You\u2019re assisting us with some truly amazing work about constructed intelligence and full-neuro game play. There are even insights into the human subconscious and stimuli processing that I suspect will have significant implications going forward in other realms of study.\n I say all this so you\u2019ll understand why I\u2019d so much like to meet to discuss the next steps, since we\u2019ve had to terminate the study slightly earlier than planned. Your in-house medical team has been exemplary, and we are completely understanding of what happened\u2014immunity to memory suppressants is a risk of repeated exposure and this was discussed prior to beginning. We agree with you that the testing stage has effectively ended\u2014the downside of informed consent.\n However, because of this, we would like to work out some visitations with the subjects in question. I understand our team has had some miscommunications with your administration trying to set these up. Let me assure you this is the standard debrief for any long-term player. And in this particular case, I expect that the subjects themselves would benefit from being able to speak with a trained professional about their experience. The amount and type of memories that might be restored have definite in-game applications and are potential data points well within the scope of our contract with your correctional facility. I\u2019m happy to discuss further particulars\u2014please let me know your thoughts.\n Sincerely,\n Frederick March\n Dr. March was already in the VP\u2019s office, and Woods wasn\u2019t, which meant the worst. Benjamina let the closed-door click echo a moment, trying to decide if looking stoic or penitent would work better. (Women who were too stoic got fired for not caring; women who were too penitent got fired for poor performance.) She forced herself not to ask questions as she sat. Inquisitive women were no better than the other kinds.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with Themis,\u201d the VP said. He looked from one of them to the other. \u201cFrederick knows already.\u201d\n Of course he did. Benjamina waited.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not the simulation,\u201d the VP continued after a moment, as if to put her mind at ease, as if she was concerned that somehow her work wasn\u2019t up to par and they would have waited until now to tell her. \u201cIn fact, Erytheia\u2014the coders have aliases, it\u2019s easier,\u201d he explained to Dr. March, \u201c\u2014has our lowest fault rate, and has spent the most time working on individual settings for Roland. I think she could be invaluable to us during the postmortem process.\u201d\n Benjamina blinked. \u201cPostmortem of what?\u201d\n Dr. March turned toward her. \u201cDid you know Ms. Roland was a drug addict?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d she said, and her stomach dropped as she considered why the medical side of the experiment wasn\u2019t feasible any more. \u201cDid she get any memories back when the drugs stopped working, or is it still a fog?\u201d\n \u201cShe got them back.\u201d\n Stoic, she thought. Be stoic. No point being penitent now.\n \u201cAre Perlman and Agosti still in beta?\u201d If they were, she\u2019d have to talk to their coders about some in-game reason Marie was gone, though she couldn\u2019t think of one they would believe. Marie would never leave Themis. She knew it best. Benjamina might have to port in on a simulation and drop dead in front of them.\n \u201cNo,\u201d said the VP. \u201cWe decided to stop beta across the board. Dr. March is trying to get the warden to agree to interviews so we can find out how the, uh\u2014the memory process? Is going. It will probably take a few weeks. Woods will go along and observe, obviously\u2014continuity for them\u2014and then he can circle back with you, so we can bring our findings to the team in a way that isn\u2019t so . . . clinical. No offense.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d said Dr. March. He was still looking at Benjamina.\n \u201cLet me know when,\u201d she said, and that was the last thing anyone needed from her.\n She drove home with shaking hands, for no good reason\u2014Marie was a test user, they used to have test users at fucking conventions. She\u2019d liked that better; there were plenty of ways to test what players would believe without lying to them at the beginning. Management wanted to test if the environment could fool the mind, but no one had asked Benjamina. None of this had been her idea. Nothing was her fault.\n The night was barely cloudy, and she drove past her turnoff and out until there was nothing but the highway on either side, so when she set up the telescope, she could see a glimpse of Proxima Centauri through the haze of light pollution. It blinked back and forth in the lens, and it was so dim. Light from there would never quite suffice.\n No one had said anything to the development team\u2014no one ever did unless something was wrong\u2014but she suspected this game was more than a Virtual Experience market maker. There were private companies prepping long-haul spacecraft with stasis technology; they\u2019d want to train their people in the most realistic conditions possible, and they had money to burn.\n Normally, she\u2019d write a letter to Marie. Dear Marie, I was looking up at Proxima tonight and I thought about you. Dear Marie, I got your letter. I programmed the thrush to mimic you a little, and you noticed. When the first astronauts land on Proxima Centauri b, maybe there will really be birds. I\u2019ve studied everything I can, and there\u2019s no telling. It might all be a layer of ice. There might be mountains everywhere. They might try to make a new home in a place that\u2019s nothing but poison. Dear Marie, I want you to be happy there.\n Through the lens, the planet slid around the star.\n Woods,\n After you came and talked to us, Samara found out you hadn\u2019t even paid us for our time in Themis. Mistake, by the way\u2014if you\u2019d paid us it would have at least looked like you weren\u2019t trying to use us like lab rats and get away with it\u2014and I feel like you should have known better. Not the company, but, you. You always seemed like a guy who wanted everything to have a reason.\n Samara\u2019s got a lawyer, and the company should have papers by now. She told me not to contact you. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s suing, because you all deserve it. Go bankrupt.\n But I have an offer for whoever\u2019s in charge: I can\u2019t testify if I\u2019m dead, and I want to go back to Themis permanently. I don\u2019t know how long \u2018permanently\u2019 is, since the prison refuses to keep people on life support for things like that and you won\u2019t want to bring me to a hospital, so just budget accordingly\u2014a person probably starves to death in a week? So, a week. Unless I\u2019ve built up such a resistance to the meds that it kills me in a few hours, which I assume would be cheaper.\n I don\u2019t know who actually made Themis. I\u2019m assuming you were involved, because you had the shortest fuse of anybody there, and at the time I thought that\u2019s just what being law enforcement did to people, but it makes more sense if you made it. And I don\u2019t know who I was writing to, that whole time. In Themis I just thought I had someone I loved, and he was where my letters went. I didn\u2019t know I needed to love someone so badly you could lie to me about it for four years\u2014but that\u2019s how it worked, the psychologist said. You made Samara write reports because whatever you managed to do with her, there were some things she wouldn\u2019t fall for. I was an idiot and I\u2019d been lonely my whole life. You could do anything to me.\n It wasn\u2019t you, was it? Was it one person writing me back, or did you reply by committee? One of you must have seen the picture of my arrest, since you gave me long hair in Themis. You talked about missing my braids. Whoever it was, go fuck yourself. I didn\u2019t even like it, it was too long, but in Themis I kept it long all that time for your sake. I wanted to cut it\u2014it got so humid in the summers I dreamed of shaving it off, I must have told you, I wrote you so much\u2014but keeping my hair long was like a promise we\u2019d see each other again. So I kept it.\n I thought that I couldn\u2019t quite picture you because being in stasis on the ship seeped the color out of your dreams. And then it had been a long time, so of course I couldn\u2019t really remember you\u2014I looked at your messages and forgot whether you had good posture or not when you typed. I wanted to think you hunched like I did, like that weird pang in the lower back was something we shared 25 trillion miles away. I wondered sometimes why I\u2019d gone to Proxima Centauri if I had someone I loved so much. Not that you can say that to the person you left behind. I never even mentioned it to Samara. But everybody knew Carlos and I had loved ones back home. When there are so few of you, you end up knowing a lot of things that you never talk about.\n Carlos isn\u2019t real, right? I mean\u2014the doctor told me he wasn\u2019t, I know he wasn\u2019t. But there wasn\u2019t a person pretending to be him? He was just a program that got really excited about apple cider?\n I don\u2019t even know how to be angry at you\u2014it was the worst hour of my life and I threw up after, but it wasn\u2019t You (whoever that is) explaining it, I would have been able to tell. So it still feels like you weren\u2019t part of what went wrong, like the program got stuck even after I woke up and you locked me out and I\u2019m still carrying you, someone I love and just forgot\u2014\n Anyway, I\u2019m going through withdrawal. The prison definitely doesn\u2019t care\u2014they said if I could go through it with the drugs that got me in here I could go through it with whatever they stuck in me to make me forget Themis. But maybe if you read this letter, you still consider me market research and this will be helpful. No appetite, no energy. I have a headache right behind my eyes. I\u2019m always cold, even though Themis was colder than prison so you\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t be. I sleep a lot. I always dream of being back in Themis. Probably good news for you. Sell a million copies. Just give me mine.\n And fix the bread. It never worked right, that should be changed.\n Let me go home.\n Marie\n Benjamina waited until the office was empty before she crossed the floor to Woods\u2019 office. Stoic, not penitent; stoic people didn\u2019t skulk over to meet someone they barely liked just to see how interviews had gone with the people they had used.\n She\u2019d never been to his office before\u2014he must always have come to her, strange, she\u2019d never even noticed\u2014and it was so blank it startled her into stillness at the threshold.\n \u201cWant an invitation?\u201d He was standing, reaching for his coat, like he\u2019d just been waiting for her so they could walk out together. \u201cYou look like a vampire.\u201d\n She didn\u2019t say anything, and she didn\u2019t move closer; after a second, he cracked a grin. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of an asshole, Harris.\u201d\n They walked out in silence, but from the way his thumb brushed the front of his coat lapel over and over, something terrible had happened and they were just waiting to be away from the cameras.\n Six blocks later, he said, \u201cIt was bad.\u201d\n She stopped and looked at him.\n \u201cShe, uh\u2014\u201d He rubbed his hand once, rough, across his forehead. \u201cIn Themis, she looked fine. Healthy. It was stupid to assume she\u2019d look the same in person, but I didn\u2019t expect . . . I didn\u2019t expect it. Samara\u2019s suing us.\u201d\n It took her a second too long to catch up, and before she could stop it it was out: \u201cBecause of how Marie looks?\u201d\n \u201cNo, if Samara knew how Marie looked she\u2019d have just murdered me.\u201d His hands had disappeared into his pockets, fists that pulled against the shoulders and ruined the line of his coat. She\u2019d put that into their last game, the noir murder mystery\u2014the private eye yanked on his coat from the inside that same way. She thought she\u2019d invented it; she\u2019d been proud of herself.\n The letter he handed her was on paper so thin she hesitated to touch it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to me, but trust me, it\u2019s for you.\u201d\n She wanted to take it home and read it where she couldn\u2019t embarrass herself, but if Woods sat through three interviews she could manage this. She read it in the wide alley garden between two office buildings, where admin staff ate lunch to pretend they\u2019d gotten away from everything. At some point she started shaking; he stood next to her like they were pretending the wind was cold. She read it again. She put it in her pocket. He didn\u2019t argue.\n \u201cWill you see her again?\u201d\n \u201cI could get arrested for passing her company information. We\u2019re getting sued.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n \u201cFuck it, I\u2019m hungry,\u201d he said.\n They found a place far enough away they felt all right sitting down. He ate three pieces of bread out of the plastic basket in the first five minutes. Then he tore a napkin into pieces.\n \u201cSamara\u2019s skin and bones. Anthony\u2019s got insomnia. Dr. Asshole said it was just drug interactions. The prison claims the game damages the cortex. They\u2019re probably going to sue each other while Samara and Anthony are suing us.\u201d\n \u201cBut not Marie.\u201d\n He looked at her. His eyes were very dark; they couldn\u2019t quite get them to register in Themis\u2014they coded as black, which always looked flat, so anyone who met him in the game thought his eyes were lighter brown. It must have been a surprise for Marie to see him as he really was.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n \u201cAre you going to see her again?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m not passing her a letter, Ben.\u201d\n \u201cAre you allowed to have an assistant with you, for the interviews? Stenography? Someone has to be holding the recorder.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind.\u201d\n Her lips pulled tight across each row of teeth. \u201cI have to do something.\u201d\n \u201cIf you\u2019re looking to feel less guilty, stop. No such thing.\u201d\n He blurred underneath the tears that sprang up. She let them go\u2014too late not to be penitent\u2014so her vision would be clearer for what came next. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go myself,\u201d she said.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than your job is worth.\u201d\n There was nothing to say to that; her job had been worth so little there was no point.\n Outside it was not quite dark, and just beginning to be cold; the temperature of Themis, decided by a developer so much her senior she\u2019d never met him.\n When she turned toward home, he walked with her.\n Halfway there, he said, \u201cWe have one more interview with her.\u201d\n Hi Marie,\n My handle on the Themis team is Erytheia. It\u2019s not my real name, but it\u2019s easier to keep track of who wrote which code this way. Erytheia was one of the daughters of Themis. (I didn\u2019t pick it.) When we were getting ready for the dry run they made me your experience specialist so we could concentrate on each user\u2019s take on Themis and build as rich a world as possible.\n Woods showed me your letter.\n I just wanted you to know there wasn\u2019t a committee. All your letters came to me, and I read them all. Some of what you told me went into a development memo, like how there weren\u2019t enough insects for a landscape with that much standing water and vegetation. But I didn\u2019t send my letters to trick you into writing more often, and I didn\u2019t discuss anything personal. I answered you because I wanted you to feel like there was a person writing you back. I was the person writing you back.\n -E\n Hey Marie,\n Can you sleep? I can\u2019t fucking sleep. My body thinks it\u2019s too dark because it\u2019s dumb and can only remember one set of things at a time and it\u2019s stuck on Themis\u2014like, we were definitely stuck on Themis but you don\u2019t have to be such an asshole about it, get used to night and day and let me get some fucking sleep, damn.\n And honestly the Themis shit doesn\u2019t really bother me. Everything I can remember from there is all of us just doing our best and getting along, so it\u2019s not like it was embarrassing. I feel like an idiot for not realizing sooner\u2014now it\u2019s so fucking obvious why the movie bank didn\u2019t work, because it was too complicated to make it work inside the game or whatever\u2014but actually being there was fine. The part that bothers me is the whole time out here that I thought I was just depressed and dreaming about some random planet is the part that\u2019s vanishing, like that\u2019s the only part the drugs actually affected once the wall wore off. Can you imagine what we must have looked like to everybody else, hopped up on that stuff?\n I\u2019m signing Samara\u2019s guy\u2019s thing. Are you? You should, they\u2019re trying to pay us off but that just means they know they fucked up and want us to keep quiet.\n You\u2019re not talking to anyone about any of this, right? They told me you\u2019re having a rough time and I get that. What wasn\u2019t better about Themis than being locked up? But you get killed that way, or they find some reason to extend your sentence twenty years, so zip that shit and just wait for Samara\u2019s guy to make us too famous to die.\n When we get out we should see if we can get a parole dispensation to cross state lines, it was cool all living together, that was nice. Plus movies work here, that\u2019s a reason to stay here. Plus I bet your bread in the real world is amazing.\n Keep your cool, Marie. I know you can do this.\n -Anthony\n Marie,\n My attorney heard from Othrys Games that you\u2019ve been in contact with the company, trying to make a deal to get back to Themis. He wanted to send you a cease and desist, but I told him I wanted to talk to you first before we did anything official.\n The case we\u2019re building downplays the nature of the game as much as possible. It doesn\u2019t matter that the game wasn\u2019t some battle simulator where we died all the time\u2014it matters that they did it to us without our permission and then hoped people would ignore it because nobody cares about us. If you keep asking to go back in there, they\u2019re going to use it as evidence that what they were doing was benign, or helpful, and we\u2019re going to have to fight that impression in court, and when the game hits shelves and it\u2019s fine, it will look even worse. We\u2019re fighting the company\u2014we can\u2019t let the game become the thing we\u2019re fighting.\n This thing is really important\u2014my lawyer says it could be a cornerstone for other cases about prisoners\u2019 rights. That\u2019s big, Marie. It\u2019s bigger than us. Cut it out.\n I\u2019m not saying all this to be cruel\u2014I miss it there, too. I could do my work and close doors behind me, of course fucking I miss it. But trying to get back to a lie is only going to hurt us. We need to be free again here. This is our shot. What they did to us was wrong\u2014you can\u2019t fix that. Let me fight it.\n Flush this letter. They can\u2019t find it.\n Samara\n The Othrys lawyers call Benjamina for a deposition, and she sits in a meeting room with no windows with her back to the door\u2014the only other seat, across from the lawyer whose smile is set tight across his face and doesn\u2019t get anywhere near his eyes\u2014and tries to ignore that this is all a setup to make her uncomfortable.\n She answers fifty questions about the game: its purpose (\u201cAny game\u2019s purpose\u2014entertainment\u201d), what game play will be like (it takes ten minutes, and the lawyer\u2019s mouth purses the more she talks about how beautiful Themis is), the passage of time (\u201cFour to seven times faster than real time, everybody playing an instance has to agree on the speed if they\u2019re playing in the MMORPG rather than single-player,\u201d she says, just to watch his jaw tick before he asks for clarification), how long it\u2019s been in development (five years), how long the beta test has been going (just over a year), the chance of fatigue (\u201cThe same as with any mentally stimulating activity, like a deposition,\u201d she says, and the lawyer\u2019s lips positively disappear).\n \u201cDid you know that Samara Perlman is trying to use the time she spent in Themis as proof of good behavior to reduce her sentence?\u201d\n It\u2019s an amazing tactic. She keeps her face neutral. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n \u201cDo you have an opinion on the validity of that?\u201d\n \u201cNo one who beta tested Themis ever evidenced any antisocial behavior, and as they believed the simulation was real life, their behavior in Themis would be close to real-world behavior.\u201d\n \u201cIf I play a video game and kill a hundred imaginary people, am I a bad person outside the game?\u201d\n \u201cBecause of killing the video game people, specifically?\u201d\n He takes an even breath in and out. \u201cMiss Harris, if you could answer the question.\u201d\n \u201cI think there\u2019s a line between fantasy and reality, but the three subjects who had Themis beta-tested on them weren\u2019t aware that line had even been crossed, so the question is kind of useless.\u201d\n \u201cPlease answer it.\u201d\n \u201cI did.\u201d\n He closes his eyes and counts to five, this time, which gives her enough time to plant the bug under the table.\n She lets the bug run\u2014in for one count of corporate espionage, in for two counts\u2014and siphons out the Othrys talk on her home laptop, with its wallpaper she made from Themis: the view outside the kitchen, where the thrush is singing.\n The lawyer hums and taps his pen; in the microphone it sounds like a stone gavel. \u201cWages we might have to push back on, since I\u2019m not sure we can really count playing video games as \u2018labor.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cAgreed,\u201d someone else says. \u201cPlus I see that they\u2019re pushing for time served for the passage of time in the game AND asking for wages for physical hours spent using the game. We can probably use that to shut down this thing at both ends. If they can\u2019t decide what was more important, how can we?\u201d\n \u201cGood point,\u201d the lawyer says. \u201cWe should get Warden Collins back in here to talk about labor practices. Give him enough rope to hang himself, we can show the only people using these inmates was the prison.\u201d\n The next day at work, she comes into Woods\u2019 office, closes the door behind her.\n \u201cThey\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n They stand for a little while not looking at each other. He\u2019s put up a panorama of Themis on his office wall. It\u2019s the geological survey, before they started the naturalist pass and brought people in; the idea of Themis, before anything really happened. The sun is setting. The sun is always setting.\n She waits until they lose the case before she visits Marie.\n Marie Roland on Themis is nearly six feet tall, has bakers\u2019 arms, covers four feet at a stride. She has lines around her eyes from squinting at the sun; they got deeper on Themis, where the sun is safer to look at. Her voice is deep enough that Benjamina had to program the Acomys cahirinus knockoff to startle and bolt when she laughed.\n Marie Roland on the other side of the visitation table is someone who\u2014Benjamina has to accept it all at once, there\u2019s no point in doing things with best intentions any more\u2014Benjamina\u2019s driven into the grave.\n She sits down. Marie waits a few seconds to look up at her.\n \u201cThat was you?\u201d she says, and it\u2019s with such disdain that Benjamina almost smiles.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cHave you come to apologize?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be worth much, but yes.\u201d\n Marie sits back in her chair. Five seven, maybe five eight; the circles under her eyes are as big as her eyes.\n You end up loving the things you make. Benjamina had been prepared for that\u2014she\u2019d seen it happen in other games, she\u2019d seen it happen to Woods, she had braced herself. But Marie was made already; Benjamina can\u2019t look her in the eye.\n \u201cSamara got to be a biologist. Anthony was an engineer. Was there a reason I wasn\u2019t a scientist? Did my file say I was too stupid?\u201d\n Benjamina shrugs. \u201cThey assigned you to me. I didn\u2019t know enough science to code one.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to bake, either,\u201d Marie says.\n They sit for a moment in quiet. Benjamina leans forward and starts to tell her why she\u2019s come, but Marie starts talking, and she freezes.\n \u201cI\u2019ve forgotten a lot of important things,\u201d Marie says to the tabletop. \u201cThere was\u2014there was a bird, and I know we were trying to make cider but I can\u2019t remember how far we got? Was Woods going to arrest us?\u201d\n \u201cNo. The\u2014uh, the point of the game was to see what people would do with minimal interference.\u201d\n Marie\u2019s gaze is sharp. Benjamina programmed that stare in wholesale, without ever seeing it. In person it feels like a slap.\n \u201cSo you picked convicts to see what we would do if we thought we could get away with it? Burn in hell.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m wearing a recorder,\u201d Benjamina says, \u201cif there\u2019s anything you want to get off your chest.\u201d\n To Penitentiary Staff:\n This is a general notice that MARIE ROLAND [ID: 68223-18-0709] should be given a psychiatric evaluation as soon as possible. Recently she has evidenced delusional thinking and bursts of hostility, and a recent visit with a supposed family member left her extremely agitated. All future visits must be approved by the warden\u2019s office, and Roland will not be allowed to meet any visitors whatsoever until she has complied with the evaluation and any recommended medication regimen.\n Sincerely,\n Janet Evanston, on behalf of Christopher Collins, Warden\n The following letter to the editor was delivered to our editorial offices by a third party. Upon confirming pertinent facts, the Evening Times considers the letter worthy of publication.\n When I was in Themis, I caught a fly.\n You\u2019ll hear about Themis soon, if they aren\u2019t already selling it. It\u2019s beautiful there. You\u2019ll want to stay in it forever. That\u2019s not a threat; I just envy you.\n When you stand next to the river and think about vampires, know that I was there first. They sent me without telling me it was virtual. I thought I had been selected to be the first inhabitant of a new planet. I should have known better\u2014the game couldn\u2019t make me forget who I was, and no one like me gets selected for something like that\u2014but Themis is hard enough to live in that you believe it\u2019s real. It never really feels like night or day and your sleep cycle gets messed up and the terrain is rough for vegetables, so you have to fight the soil for eight months to get anything started. It\u2019s not easy. The bread there never baked right. I thought it was the water, for a long time.\n I\u2019m currently in the [redacted by editors], which is where Othrys tested Themis on us. I didn\u2019t volunteer\u2014I was selected for a sleep study, they said, because I had vivid dreams, and it would get me time off for good behavior if I agreed. They never told us about Themis. For a year, I lived in two places and I didn\u2019t know.\n I don\u2019t know what they gave me to make me forget, but they gave it to me on each end of Themis, on the way in and after I was out. Eventually my body got used to it\u2014side effect of being an addict, which you think they\u2019d have worried about more, but.\n Some things I\u2019ve forgotten\u2014there was a bird I loved, but I couldn\u2019t tell you what it looked or sounded like. It\u2019s a bird in a dream. But I remember more of it than I was supposed to.\n We tried to sue the game company for experimenting on us without our knowledge or permission. It didn\u2019t work; we pushed too hard to have it affect our sentences, I guess.\n I\u2019m not writing this because I\u2019m surprised. You\u2019re probably not surprised, either. Part of me wishes I had it in me to be noble and fight to get us all released because of this\u2014Samara and Anthony deserve their freedom. But I\u2019m writing because I want to live inside Themis until I die, and Othrys says they won\u2019t let me.\n We lost the lawsuit, so there\u2019s no danger in it. It probably looks great to them that I want to go back, anyway. And most people won\u2019t live in the same Themis I built. They\u2019re making it more interesting for new people. You\u2019ll have cities to live in instead of just shipping-crate mess halls; you\u2019ll be able to see the mountains. You\u2019ll all be dealing with each other.\n Samara\u2019s lawyer told me the Themis I lived in was a demo they built just for Anthony and Samara and me\u2014it\u2019s not the version on the shelves, so I could live inside it and never come into contact with anyone. You\u2019ll have a hard time in Themis, but I\u2019ll never be the problem.\n They developed that game around us, one thing at a time\u2014the daytime got more purple as we went along and we called it the seasons, and the wildlife filled in in bursts because they didn\u2019t think we\u2019d remember what had been there the last time. (We did remember\u2014we just thought nature was getting used to us.) Eventually there were plants with briars and fruit flies that would bother me when I was cooking. Real life. Things you believe. I caught one of them late at night, before it could land on some dough I was rolling out for cookies, and I carried it outside because Samara, our team biologist, had told us to be very careful to preserve everything we found so she could catalog all of it.\n It\u2019s not real, they forced it on us and we were never meant to keep it, I\u2019m not stupid, but I held the fruit fly in the cup of my hand and felt its wings beating. How can they say that\u2019s not mine?\n Marie Roland\n Correction: As the writer of the letter was unavailable for editorial consultation on yesterday\u2019s Letter to the Editor, at the advice of legal counsel, it has been removed.\n \u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d\n Benjamina hands him his coffee. They\u2019ve told the office they\u2019re dating; it explains a lot of time in each other\u2019s company.\n \u201cI tried to fucking\u2014\u201d she looks around, lowers her volume, \u201chelp Marie be someone no one could ignore. That\u2019s her best chance.\u201d\n \u201cHer best chance is a legal appeal by people who know what they\u2019re doing, not you on a crusade.\u201d\n She sits back and looks at him, flat. \u201cYou think that this time, for sure, three inmates are going to win against two state prisons and Othrys Games by just quietly doing the right thing.\u201d\n He leans closer; his hand, flat on the table, almost touches her fist.\n \u201cI think if anybody realizes you\u2019re the problem, you are going to need help and I am not going to be able to give it. What are you thinking?\u201d\n She meets his eye. \u201cI saw Marie.\u201d\n REVIEW: THEMIS IS A WHOLE NEW WORLDby Sarah McElroy\n As a games reviewer, you tend to get jaded about new products. The graphics are increasingly realistic, the plots increasingly dense, and there\u2019s a sense that some games are more about one-upsmanship than about providing a transporting experience for players.\n Themis is coming to the market nearly three years late, and shrouded in mystery. It was the subject of a lawsuit two years ago, as beta testers complained they hadn\u2019t signed on for something as immersive as they got. For normal people, that gives you pause. For gamers, that\u2019s the kind of buzz money can\u2019t buy. (A one-day-only letter to the editor also appeared in the Evening Times; the newspaper didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, so the message-board debate rages on about whether it was a legitimate report from the trenches, or genius advertising.)\n And if you\u2019ve been waiting for Themis as long as I have, it\u2019s awkward to realize you understand exactly what those beta testers meant.\n In terms of practicalities, Themis isn\u2019t very much different from half a dozen other VR immersions that have appeared the last few years. You\u2019re part of a hardscrabble crew assigned to terraform Themis, the first colony on Proxima Centauri. If you\u2019re looking for more plot, you won\u2019t find it: the entire hook of Themis is that the world is, quite literally, what you make it.\n But what a world. The eternal sunset casts a rosy glow over the camp, the flies hover over any kill you make. And if you think otherwise, trust me, you\u2019ll end up making kills\u2014Themis is about moral questions as much as strategy choices, and your team will have to eat something until the potato harvest. Every herbivore on Proxima Centauri is a take on Earth fauna of the taiga, so if you can\u2019t look a reindeer in the eye and fire, you\u2019re going to go hungry a lot. And you should think quickly; Themis has admirable ambitions about its much-touted real-time settings, but there\u2019s no doubt that the optimal game play occurs at about seven times the speed of life, and at that speed, hunger levels are highly responsive. (Given that your larger goal is simply to cross the mountains and make geological observations about the ice on the dark side of the planet, hunger might be the closest you come to emergency action.)\n There have been concerns about the complications of MMORPG when everything is quite so unstructured; it\u2019s one thing to put up with creeps when they\u2019re a mage avatar in your questing party, and another to deal with them in an environment so sharply realized that it might as well be real. I\u2019m honestly not sure how that setting will develop\u2014when we played it in the Tabula offices, all was well, but the more you open the encampment to strangers, the greater the risk. It\u2019s just as well the game has a Private setting, where you and a handful of AI colleagues split the work and develop the colony in contemplative near-silence. You even get to choose your profession. (Medic is so boring as to be childish; go for Cook. Don\u2019t worry\u2014there\u2019s no achievement bar. You can mess up bread as much as you want.)\n These days, to survive in the marketplace, a game can\u2019t just be good and survive. It can\u2019t even settle for being impressive. It has to be earth-shaking. And for a game that can be explained in a single sentence, Themis really does defy description. I know I\u2019ll be seeing copycats for the next ten years; I know none of them will make me feel the way Themis did.\n RATING: Must-Have\n Hello Sarah,\n I saw your piece about Themis in Tabula. I am a developer at Othrys who worked on the beta testing for Themis and would love to speak with you further. You can contact me at the email above.\n Benjamina Harris\n To All Othrys Staff:\n Benjamina Harris has been terminated, effective immediately. In the next few days, HR staff may meet with you to ask questions about her performance. We apologize for the inconvenience, and appreciate your cooperation.\n Sincerely,\n Dan Turpin, CEO\n It feels so silly, handing Woods a disk\u2014first time she\u2019s handled a physical disk in six years, no bigger than her thumbnail, and still passing it over is like handing him a raw egg.\n \u201cI told you I can\u2019t help you,\u201d he says, but she has her hands in her pockets and after a minute, he slips the thing out of sight.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d she says. He\u2019s furious with her\u2014that she didn\u2019t get out before she was fired, that she\u2019s had to create a new identity after everyone\u2019s already on alert, that she\u2019s making him responsible for backup copies of bugged conversations and stolen correspondence that will get her thrown in prison for fifty years. But he\u2019s here when he shouldn\u2019t be, and that makes him better than some.\n \u201cYou won\u2019t make it out of the country,\u201d he says. \u201cPlease just hide closer to home. Yosemite\u2019s a thousand square miles.\u201d\n She could. It would be safer. But living alone in a clearing near the river, birds calling out in the dark, mountains to the northwest\u2014she swallows. It would be stealing.\n She says, \u201cI hope it\u2019s bad enough that someone finds Marie.\u201d\n She heads south; the sun sets off the red rocks, and there\u2019s no one else for a hundred miles, and she sits in the quiet car and compiles a new geography, and realizes she\u2019ll never reach the border.\n Still, she drives while she can. The footprint of the mesas is so big it never shifts; she moves like someone in a dream, not quite fast enough.\n EVENING TIMES\n OTHRYS WHISTLEBLOWER TELLS ALL ABOUT SHOCKING MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION: \u201cTHEMIS WASN\u2019T WORTH THE COST\u201d\n THE SUNDAY LEDGER\n \u201cTHE WARDEN KNEW, AND NO ONE STOPPED HIM\u201d: HOW \u201cTHEMIS\u201d MUST MARK THE END OF THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX\n THE NEW YORK STANDARD\n THE ORACLE OF OTHRYS: VIDEO GAME SNITCH BLOWS THE LID OFF VR HORROR\n THE LONE CANDLE\n THE THEMIS EXPERIMENT: WHY VIRTUAL REALITY MAKES EVERYONE A PRISONER\n OWL EYES NEWS\n BOSS BATTLE: CHRISTOPHER COLLINS, \u201cTHE VIDEO-GAME WARDEN,\u201d RETIRES WITH $2 MILLION SEVERANCE\n TABULA GAMES\n WORLD-CLASS: \u201cTHEMIS\u201d BREAKS SALES RECORDS\n THE NEW YORK WEEK IN REVIEW\n MARIE ROLAND: THE WOMAN WHO CAN NEVER GO HOME\n Samara, Anthony,\n This is my last letter. I hope this ends up being of some use to you\u2014make no secret of it, if it will help. I\u2019m happy to be anybody\u2019s pawn now.\n It was an honor building Themis with you. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not coming, but it won\u2019t be the same.\n Marie\n Spent today walking downstream a dozen kilometers and recording things. There are more species of cattails in this one stretch than I ever saw on Earth. Saw a lot of teeth marks on them\u2014bodes well for the idea of some Earth-adjacent fauna that have just been scared off by our camp but might eventually be coaxed to come back.\n Of course, I shredded my feet and somehow managed to get a giant bruise on my knee without even falling down. (How did they ever let me become a naturalist with a constitution like this?) Listened to a whole chapter of a book while I was soaking in salt water, which is the most salt and the most reading I\u2019ve gotten since I landed.\n You\u2019d think they\u2019d have sent more people, but I guess for a temperate zone you don\u2019t really have to. Winters don\u2019t kill you here, and it\u2019s only a couple of weeks until the pass melts and we can set off for the mountains to do the survey for the second-wave team. (My bet is glacier melt that will sustain a thousand people; Vivian claims there\u2019s taiga and we can support twice that. Carlos is holding the money.)\n It\u2019s winter at home, by now, isn\u2019t it? I hope all is well with you. I would love to know for sure.\n The bread I made today was edible! The bird outside was very proud of me\u2014he sang along with me all night. I threw him crumbs, at the end of it, and he liked them, and it feels like it will even last the night without going stale.

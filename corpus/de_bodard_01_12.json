It is the first one that she composed in High Mheng\u2014which had been and remains a debased language, a blend between that of the San-Tay foreigners, and that of the Mheng, Anshi\u2019s own people.\nShe composed it on Shattered Pine Prison, sitting in the darkness of her cell, listening to the faint whine of the bots that crawled on the walls\u2014melded to the metal and the crisscrossing wires, clinging to her skin\u2014monitoring every minute movement she made\u2014the voices of her heart, the beat of her thoughts in her brain, the sweat on her body.\nAnshi had once been a passable poet in San-Tay, thoughtlessly fluent in the language of upper classes, the language of bot-handlers; but the medical facility had burnt that away from her, leaving an oddly-shaped hole in her mind, a gap that ached like a wound. When she tried to speak, no words would come out\u2014not in San-Tay, not in High Mheng\u2014only a raw croak, like the cry of a dying bird. Bots had once flowed to do her bidding; but now they only followed the will of the San-Tay.\nThere were no stars on Shattered Pine, where everything was dark with no windows; and where the faint yellow light soon leeched the prisoners\u2019 skin of all colors. But, once a week, the prisoners would be allowed onto the deck of the prison station\u2014heavily escorted by San-Tay guards. Bots latched onto their faces and eyes, forcing them to stare into the darkness\u2014into the event horizon of the black hole, where all light spiraled inwards and vanished, where everything was crushed into insignificance. There were bodies outside\u2014prisoners who had attempted to escape, put in lifesuits and jettisoned, slowly drifting into a place where time and space ceased to have any meaning. If they were lucky, they were already dead.\nFrom time to time, there would be a jerk as the bots stung someone back into wakefulness; or low moans and cries, from those whose minds had snapped. Shattered Pine bowed and broke everyone; and the prisoners that were released back to Felicity Station came back diminished and bent, waking up every night weeping and shaking with the memory of the black hole.\nAnshi\u2014who had been a scholar, a low-level magistrate, before she\u2019d made the mistake of speaking up against the San-Tay\u2014sat very still, and stared at the black hole\u2014seeing into its heart, and knowing the truth: she was of no significance, easily broken, easily crushed\u2014but she had known that since the start. All men were as nothing to the vast universe.\nIt was on the deck that Anshi met Zhiying\u2014a small, diminutive woman who always sat next to her. She couldn\u2019t glance at Zhiying; but she felt her presence, nevertheless; the strength and hatred that emanated from her, that sustained her where other people failed.\nDay after day they sat side by side, and Anshi formed poems in her mind, haltingly piecing them together in High Mheng\u2014San-Tay was denied to her, and, like many of the Mheng upper class, she spoke no Low Mheng. Day after day, with the bots clinging to her skin like overripe fruit, and Zhiying\u2019s presence, burning like fire at her side; and, as the verses became stronger and stronger in her mind, Anshi whispered words, out of the guards\u2019 hearing, out of the bots\u2019 discrimination capacities\u2014haltingly at first, and then over and over, like a mantra on the prayer beads. Day after day; and, as the words sank deeper into her mind, Anshi slowly came to realize that the bots on her skin were not unmoving, but held themselves trembling, struggling against their inclination to move\u2014and that the bots clinging to Zhiying were different, made of stronger materials to resist the fire of Zhiying\u2019s anger. She heard the fast, frantic beat of their thoughts processes, which had its own rhythm, like poetry spoken in secret\u2014and felt the hard shimmer that connected the bots to the San-Tay guards, keeping everything together.\nAnd, in the dim light of Shattered Pine, Anshi subvocalized words in High Mheng, reaching out with her mind as she had done, back when she had been free. She hadn\u2019t expected anything to happen; but the bots on her skin stiffened one after the other, and turned to the sound of her voice, awaiting orders.\nBefore she left Felicity, Xu Wen expected security at San-Tay Prime\u2019s spaceport to be awful\u2014they would take one glance at her travel documents, and bots would rise up from the ground and crawl up to search every inch of skin, every body cavity. Mother has warned her often enough that the San-Tay have never forgiven Felicity for waging war against them; that they will always remember the shame of losing their space colonies. She expects a personal interview with a Censor, or perhaps even to be turned back at the boundary, sent back in shame to Felicity.\nBut it doesn\u2019t turn out that way at all.\nSecurity is over in a breeze, the bots giving her nothing but a cursory body check before the guards wave her through. She has no trouble getting a cab either; things must have changed on San-Tay Prime, and the San-Tay driver waves her on without paying attention to the color of her skin.\n\u201cHere on holiday?\u201d the driver asks her in Galactic, as she slides into the floater\u2014her body sinking as the chair adapts itself to her morphology. Bots climb onto her hands, showing her ads for nearby hotels and restaurants: an odd, disturbing sight, for there are no bots on Felicity Station.\n\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Wen says, with a shrug she wills to be careless. \u201cI used to live here.\u201d\nA long, long time ago, when she was still a baby; before Mother had that frightful fight with Grandmother, and left San-Tay Prime for Felicity.\n\u201cOh?\u201d the driver swerves, expertly, amidst the traffic; taking one wide, tree-lined avenue after another. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound like it.\u201d\nWen shakes her head. \u201cI was born here, but I didn\u2019t remain here long.\u201d\n\u201cGone back to the old country, eh?\u201d The driver smiles. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Wen says, though she\u2019s unsure what to tell him. That she doesn\u2019t really know\u2014that she never really lived here, not for more than a few years, and that she has a few confused memories of a bright-lit kitchen, and bots dancing for her on the carpet of Grandmother\u2019s apartment? But she\u2019s not here for such confidences. She\u2019s here\u2014well, she\u2019s not sure why she\u2019s here. Mother was adamant Wen didn\u2019t have to come; but then, Mother has never forgiven Grandmother for the exile on San-Tay Prime.\nEverything goes fine; until they reach the boundary district, where a group of large bots crawl onto the floater, and the driver\u2019s eyes roll up as their thought-threads meld with his. At length, the bots scatter, and he turns back to Wen. \u201cSorry, m\u2019am,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to leave you here.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d Wen asks, struggling to hide her fear.\n\u201cNo floaters allowed into the Mheng districts currently,\u201d the man says. \u201cSome kind of funeral for a tribal leader\u2014the brass is afraid there will be unrest.\u201d He shrugs again. \u201cStill, you\u2019re local, right? You\u2019ll find someone to help you.\u201d\nShe\u2019s never been here; and she doesn\u2019t know anyone, anymore. Still, she forces a smile\u2014always be graceful, Mother said\u2014and puts her hand on one of the bots, feeling the warmth as it transfers money from her account on Felicity Station. After he\u2019s left her on the paved sidewalk of a street she barely recognizes, she stands, still feeling the touch of the bots against her skin\u2014on Felicity they call them a degradation, a way for the San-Tay government to control everything and everyone; and she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to get a few locator-bots at the airport.\nWen looks up, at the signs\u2014they\u2019re in both languages, San-Tay and what she assumes is High Mheng, the language of the exiles. San-Tay is all but banned on Felicity, only found on a few derelict signs on the Outer Rings, the ones the National Restructuring Committee hasn\u2019t gone around to retooling yet. Likewise, High Mheng isn\u2019t taught, or encouraged. What little she can remember is that it\u2019s always been a puzzle\u2014the words look like Mheng; but when she tries to put everything together, their true meaning seems to slip away from her.\nFeeling lost already, she wends her way deeper into the streets\u2014those few shops that she bypasses are closed, with a white cloth spread over the door. White for grief, white for a funeral.\nIt all seems so\u2014so wide, so open. Felicity doesn\u2019t have streets lined with streets, doesn\u2019t have such clean sidewalks\u2014space on the station is at a ruthless premium, and every corridor is packed with stalls and shops\u2014people eat at tables on the streets, and conduct their transactions in recessed doorways, or rooms half as large as the width of the sidewalk. She feels in another world; though, every now and then, she\u2019ll see a word that she recognizes on a sign, and follow it, in the forlorn hope that it will lead her closer to the funeral hall.\nStreet after street after street\u2014under unfamiliar trees that sway in the breeze, listening to the distant music broadcast from every doorway, from every lamp. The air is warm and clammy, a far cry from Felicity\u2019s controlled temperature; and over her head are dark clouds. She almost hopes it rains, to see what it is like\u2014in real life, and not in some simulation that seems like a longer, wetter version of a shower in the communal baths.\nAt length, as she reaches a smaller intersection, where four streets with unfamiliar signs branch off\u2014some residential area, though all she can read are the numbers on the buildings\u2014Wen stops, staring up at the sky. Might as well admit it: it\u2019s useless. She\u2019s lost, thoroughly lost in the middle of nowhere, and she\u2019ll never be on time for the funeral.\nShe\u2019d weep; but weeping is a caprice, and she\u2019s never been capricious in her life. Instead, she turns back and attempts to retrace her steps, towards one of the largest streets\u2014where, surely, she can hammer on a door, or find someone who will help her?\nShe can\u2019t find any of the streets; but at length, she bypasses a group of old men playing Encirclement on the street\u2014watching the shimmering holo-board as if their lives depended on it.\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d she asks, in Mheng.\nAs one, the men turn towards her\u2014their gazes puzzled. \u201cI\u2019m looking for White Horse Hall,\u201d Wen says. \u201cFor the funeral?\u201d\nThe men still watch her, their faces impassive\u2014dark with expressions she can\u2019t read. They\u2019re laden with smaller bots\u2014on their eyes, on their hands and wrists, hanging black like obscene fruit: they look like the San-Tay in the reconstitution movies, except that their skins are darker, their eyes narrower.\nAt length, the eldest of the men steps forwards, and speaks up\u2014his voice rerouted to his bots, coming out in halting Mheng. \u201cYou\u2019re not from here.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wen says in the same language. \u201cI\u2019m from Felicity.\u201d\nAn odd expression crosses their faces: longing, and hatred, and something else Wen cannot place. One of the men points to her, jabbers in High Mheng\u2014Wen catches just one word she understands.\nXu Anshi.\n\u201cYou\u2019re Anshi\u2019s daughter,\u201d the man says. The bots\u2019 approximation of his voice is slow, metallic, unlike the fast jabbering of High Mheng.\nWen shakes her head; and one of the other men laughs, saying something else in High Mheng.\nThat she\u2019s too young, no doubt\u2014that Mother, Anshi\u2019s daughter, would be well into middle age by now, instead of being Wen\u2019s age. \u201cDaughter of daughter,\u201d the man says, with a slight, amused smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take you to the hall, to see your grandmother.\u201d\nHe walks by her side, with the other man, the one who laughed. Neither of them speaks\u2014too hard to attempt small talk in a language they don\u2019t master, Wen guesses. They go down a succession of smaller and smaller streets, under banners emblazoned with the image of the phuong, Felicity\u2019s old symbol, before the Honored Leader made the new banner, the one that showed the station blazing among the stars\u2014something more suitable for their new status.\nEverything feels . . . odd, slightly twisted out of shape\u2014the words not quite what they ought to be, the symbols just shy of familiar; the language a frightening meld of words she can barely recognize.\nEverything is wrong, Wen thinks, shivering\u2014and yet how can it be wrong, walking among Grandmother\u2019s own people?\nSummoning bots I washed away\nTen thousand thousand years of poison\nAwakening a thousand flower-flames, a thousand phoenix birds\nFloating on a sea of blood like cresting waves\nThe weeping of the massacred millions rising from the darkness\nWe received this poem and its memories for safekeeping at a time when Xu Anshi was still on Felicity Station: on an evening before the Feast of Hungry Ghosts, when she sat in a room lit by trembling lights, thinking of Lao, her husband who had died in the uprisings\u2014and wondering how much of it had been of any worth.\nIt refers to a time when Anshi was older, wiser\u2014she and Zhiying had escaped from Shattered Pine, and spent three years moving from hiding place to hiding place, composing the pamphlets that, broadcast into every household, heralded the end of the San-Tay governance over Felicity.\nOn the night that would become known as the Second Ring Riots, Anshi stood in one of the inner rings of Felicity Station, her bots spread around her, hacked into the network\u2014half of them on her legs, pumping modifiers into her blood; half of them linked to the other Mheng bot-handlers, retransmitting scenes of carnage, of the Mheng mob running wild in the San-Tay districts of the inner rings, the High Tribunal and Spaceport Authority lasered, and the fashionable districts trashed.\n\u201cThis one,\u201d Zhiying said, pointing to a taller door, adorned with what appeared to be a Mheng traditional blessing\u2014until one realized that the characters had been chosen for aesthetic reasons only, and that they meant nothing.\nAnshi sent a subvocalized command to her bots, asking them to take the house. The feed to the rioting districts cut off abruptly, as her bots turned their attention towards the door and the house beyond: their sensors analyzing the bots on the walls, the pattern of the aerations, the cables running behind the door, and submitting hypotheses about possible architectures of the security system\u2014before the swarm reached a consensus, and made a decision.\nThe bots flowed towards the door\u2014the house\u2019s bots sought to stop them, but Anshi\u2019s bots split into two squads, and rushed past, heading for the head\u2014the central control panel, which housed the bots\u2019 communication system. Anshi had a brief glimpse of red-painted walls, and blinking holos; before her bots rushed back, job completed, and fell on the now disorganized bots at the door.\nEverything went dark, the Mheng characters slowly fading away from the door\u2019s panels.\n\u201cAll yours,\u201d Anshi said to Zhiying, struggling to remain standing\u2014all her bots were jabbering in her mind, putting forward suggestions as to what to do next; and, in her state of extreme fatigue, ignoring them was harder. She\u2019d seen enough handlers burnt beyond recovery, their brains overloaded with external stimuli until they collapsed\u2014she should have known better. But they needed her\u2014the most gifted bot-handler they had, their strategist\u2014needed her while the San-Tay were still reeling from their latest interplanetary war, while they were still weak. She\u2019d rest later\u2014after the San-Tay were gone, after the Mheng were free. There would be time, then, plenty of it.\nBao and Nhu were hitting the door with soldering knives\u2014each blow weakening the metal until the door finally gave way with a groan. The crowd behind Anshi roared; and rushed through\u2014pushing Anshi ahead of them, the world shrinking to a swirling, confused mass of details\u2014gouged-out consoles, ornaments ripped from shelves, pale men thrown down and beaten against the rush of the crowd, a whirlwind of chaos, as if demons had risen up from the underworld.\nThe crowd spread as they moved inwards; and Anshi found herself at the center of a widening circle in what had once been a guest room. Beside her, Bao was hacking at a nondescript bed, while others in the crowd beat down on the huge screen showing a sunset with odd, distorted trees\u2014some San-Tay planet that Anshi did not recognize, maybe even Prime. Anshi breathed, hard, struggling to steady herself in the midst of the devastation. Particles of down and dust drifted past her; she saw a bot on the further end, desperately trying to contain the devastation, scuttling to repair the gashes in the screen. Nhu downed it with a well-placed kick; her face distorted in a wide, disturbing grin.\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d Bao held up a mirror-necklace, which shimmered and shifted, displaying a myriad configurations for its owner\u2019s pleasure.\nNhu\u2019s laughter was harsh. \u201cThey won\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d She held out a hand; but Bao threw the necklace to the ground; and ran it through with his knife.\nAnshi did not move\u2014as if in a trance she saw all of it: the screen, the bed, the pillows that sought to mould themselves to a pleasing shape, even as hands tore them apart; the jewellery scattered on the ground; and the image of the forest, fading away to be replaced by a dull, split-open wall\u2014every single mark of San-Tay privilege, torn away and broken, never to come back. Her bots were relaying similar images from all over the station. The San-Tay would retaliate, but they would have understood, now, how fragile the foundation of their power was. How easily the downtrodden Mheng could become their downfall; and how much it would cost them to hold Felicity.\nGood.\nAnshi wandered through the house, seeking out the San-Tay bots\u2014those she could hack and reprogram, she added to her swarm; the others she destroyed, as ruthlessly as the guards had culled the prisoners on Shattered Pine.\nAnshi. Anshi.\nSomething was blinking, insistently, in the corner of her eyes\u2014the swarm, bringing something to her attention. The kitchens\u2014Zhiying, overseeing the executions. Bits and pieces, distorted through the bots\u2019 feed: the San-Tay governor, begging and pleading to be spared; his wife, dying silently, watching them all with hatred in her eyes. They\u2019d had no children; for which Anshi was glad. She wasn\u2019t Zhiying, and she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have borne the guilt.\nGuilt? There were children dying all over the station; men and women killed, if not by her, by those who followed her. She spared a bitter laugh. There was no choice. Children could die; or be raised to despise the inferior breed of the Mheng; be raised to take slaves and servants, and send dissenters like Anshi to be broken on Shattered Pine with a negligent wave of their hands. No choice.\nCome, the bots whispered in her mind, but she did not know why.\nZhiying was down to the Grand Master of Security when Anshi walked into the kitchens\u2014she barely nodded at Anshi, and turned her attention back to the man aligned in the weapons\u2019 sights.\nShe did not ask for any last words; though she did him the honor of using a bio-silencer on him, rather than the rifles they\u2019d used on the family\u2014his body crumpled inwards and fell, still intact; and he entered the world of the ancestors with the honor of a whole body. \u201cHe fought well,\u201d Zhiying said, curtly. \u201cWhat of the house?\u201d\n\u201cNot a soul left living,\u201d Anshi said, flicking through the bots\u2019 channels. \u201cNot much left whole, either.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Zhiying said. She gestured; and the men dragged the next victim\u2014a Mheng girl, dressed in the clothes of an indentured servant.\nThis\u2014this was what the bots had wanted her to see. Anshi looked to the prisoners huddled against the wall: there was one San-Tay left, an elderly man who gazed back at her, steadily and without fear. The rest\u2014all the rest\u2014were Mheng, dressed in San-Tay clothes, their skin pale and washed-out in the flickering lights\u2014stained with what looked like rice flour from one of the burst bags on the floor. Mheng. Their own people.\n\u201cElder sister,\u201d Anshi said, horrified.\nZhiying\u2019s face was dark with anger. \u201cYou delude yourself. They\u2019re not Mheng anymore.\u201d\n\u201cBecause they were indentured into servitude? Is that your idea of justice? They had no choice,\u201d Anshi said. The girl against the wall said nothing; her gaze slid away from Zhiying, to the rifle; finally resting on the body of her dead mistress.\n\u201cThey had a choice. We had a choice,\u201d Zhiying said. Her gaze\u2014dark and intense\u2014rested, for a moment, on the girl. \u201cIf we spare them, they\u2019ll just run to the militia, and denounce us to find themselves a better household. Won\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.\nAnshi, startled, realized Zhiying had addressed the girl\u2014whose gaze still would not meet theirs, as if they\u2019d been foreigners themselves.\nAt length, the girl threw her head back, and spoke in High Mheng. \u201cThey were always kind with me, and you butchered them like pigs.\u201d She was shivering now. \u201cWhat will you achieve? You can\u2019t hide on Felicity. The San-Tay will come here and kill you all, and when they\u2019re done, they\u2019ll put us in the dark forever. It won\u2019t be cushy jobs like this\u2014they\u2019ll consign us to the scavenge heaps, to the ducts-cleaning and the bots-scraping, and we won\u2019t ever see starlight again.\u201d\n\u201cSee?\u201d Zhiying said. \u201cPathetic.\u201d She gestured, and the girl crumpled like the man before her. The soldiers dragged the body away, and brought the old San-Tay man. Zhiying paused; and turned back to Anshi. \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Anshi said. \u201cI did not join this so we could kill our own countrymen.\u201d\nZhiying\u2019s mouth twisted in a bitter smile. \u201cCollaborators,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you think a regime like the San-Tay continues to exist? It\u2019s because they take some of their servants, and set them above others. Because they make us complicit in our own oppression. That\u2019s the worst of what they do, little sister\u2014turn us against each other.\u201d\nNo. The thought was crystal-clear in Anshi\u2019s mind, like a blade held against starlight. That\u2019s not the worst. The worst is that, to fight them, we have to best them at their own game.\nShe watched the old man as he died; and saw nothing in his eyes but the reflection of that bitter knowledge.\nWhite Horse Hall is huge, so huge that it\u2019s a wonder Wen didn\u2019t see it from afar\u2014more than a hundred stories, and more unveil as her floater lifts higher and higher, away from the crowd massed on the ground. Above the cloud cover, other white-clad floaters weave in and out of the traffic, as if to the steps of a dance only they can see.\nShe\u2019s alone: her escort left her at the floater station\u2014the older man with a broad smile and a wave, and the second man with a scowl, looking away from her. As they ascend higher and higher, and the air thins out\u2014to almost the temperature of Felicity\u2014Wen tries to relax, but cannot do so. She\u2019s late; and she knows it\u2014and they probably won\u2019t admit her into the hall at all. She\u2019s a stranger here; and Mother is right: she would be better off in Felicity with Zhengyao, enjoying her period of rest by flying kites, or going for a ride on Felicity\u2019s River of Good Fortune.\nAt the landing pad, a woman is waiting for her: small and plump, with hair shining silver in the unfiltered sunlight. Her face is frozen in careful blankness, and she wears the white of mourners, with none of the markers for the family of the dead.\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d she says, curtly nodding to acknowledge Wen\u2019s presence. \u201cI am Ho Van Nhu.\u201d\n\u201cGrandmother\u2019s friend,\u201d Wen says.\nNhu\u2019s face twists in an odd expression. \u201cYou know my name?\u201d She speaks perfect Galactic, with a very slight trace of an accent\u2014heard only in the odd inflections she puts on her own name.\nWen could lie; could say that Mother spoke of her often; but here, in this thin, cold air, she finds that she cannot lie\u2014any more than one does not lie in the presence of the Honoured Leader. \u201cThey teach us about you in school,\u201d she says, blushing.\nNhu snorts. \u201cNot in good terms, I\u2019d imagine. Come,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s get you prepared.\u201d\nThere are people everywhere, in costumes Wen recognizes from her history lessons\u2014oddly old-fashioned and formal, collars flaring in the San-Tay fashion, though the five panels of the dresses are those of the Mheng high court, in the days before the San-Tay\u2019s arrival.\nNhu pushes her way through the crowd, confident, until they reach a deserted room. She stands for a while in the center, eyes closed, and bots crawl out of the interstices, dragging vegetables and balls of rolled-up dough\u2014black and featureless, their bodies gleaming like knife-blades, their legs moving on a rhythm like centipedes or spiders.\nWen watches, halfway between fascination and horror, as they cut up the vegetables into small pieces\u2014flatten the dough and fill up dumplings, and put them inside small steamer units that other bots have dragged up. Other bots are already cleaning up the counter, and there is a smell in the room\u2014tea brewing in a corner. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Wen starts. How can she eat any of that, knowing how it was prepared? She swallows, and forces herself to speak more civilly. \u201cI should be with her.\u201d\nNhu shakes her head. Beads of sweat pearl on her face; but she seems to be gaining color as the bots withdraw, one by one\u2014except that Wen can still see them, tucked away under the cupboards and the sink, like curled-up cockroaches. \u201cThis is the wake, and you\u2019re already late for it. It won\u2019t make any difference if you come in quarter of an hour later. And I would be a poor host if I didn\u2019t offer you any food.\u201d\nThere are two cups of tea on the central table; Nhu pours from a teapot, and pushes one to Wen\u2014who hesitates for a moment, and then takes it, fighting against a wave of nausea. Bots dragged out the pot; the tea leaves. Bots touched the liquid that she\u2019s inhaling right now.\n\u201cYou look like your mother when she was younger,\u201d Nhu says, sipping at the tea. \u201cLike your grandmother, too.\u201d Her voice is matter-of-fact; but Wen can feel the grief Nhu is struggling to contain. \u201cYou must have had a hard time, at school.\u201d\nWen thinks on it for a while. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she says. She\u2019s had the usual bullying, the mockeries of her clumsiness, of her provincial accent. But nothing specifically directed at her ancestors. \u201cThey did not really care about who my grandmother was.\u201d It\u2019s the stuff of histories now; almost vanished\u2014only the generation of the Honored Leader remembers what it was like, under the San-Tay.\n\u201cI see,\u201d Nhu says.\nAn uncomfortable silence stretches, which Nhu makes no effort to break.\nSmall bots float by, carrying a tray with the steamed dumplings\u2014like the old vids, when the San-Tay would be receiving their friends at home. Except, of course, that the Mheng were doing the cutting-up and the cooking, in the depths of the kitchen.\n\u201cThey make you uncomfortable,\u201d Nhu says.\nWen grimaces. \u201cI\u2014we don\u2019t have bots, on Felicity.\u201d\n\u201cI know. The remnants of the San-Tay\u2014the technologies of servitude, which should better be forgotten and lost.\u201d Her voice is light, ironic; and Wen realizes that she is quoting from one of the Honored Leader\u2019s speeches. \u201cJust like High Mheng. Tell me, Wen, what do the histories say of Xu Anshi?\u201d\nNothing, Wen wants to say; but as before, she cannot bring herself to lie. \u201cThat she used the technologies of the San-Tay against them; but that, in the end, she fell prey to the lure of their power.\u201d It\u2019s what she\u2019s been told all her life; the only things that have filled the silence Mother maintains about Grandmother. But, now, staring at this small, diminutive woman, she feels almost ashamed. \u201cThat she and her followers were given a choice between exile, and death.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you believe that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Wen says. And, more carefully, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\nNhu shrugs, shaking her head. \u201cMingxia\u2014your mother once asked Anshi if she believed in reconciliation with Felicity. Anshi told her that reconciliation was nothing more than another word for forgetfulness. She was a hard woman. But then, she\u2019d lost so much in the war. We all did.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not Mother,\u201d Wen says, and Nhu shakes her head, with a brief smile.\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re here.\u201d\nOut of duty, Wen thinks. Because someone has to come, and Mother won\u2019t. Because someone should remember Grandmother, even if it\u2019s Wen\u2014who didn\u2019t know her, didn\u2019t know the war. She wonders what the Honored Leader will say about Grandmother\u2019s death, on Felicity\u2014if she\u2019ll mourn the passing of a liberator, or remind them all to be firm, to reject the evil of the San-Tay, more than sixty years after the foreigners\u2019 withdrawal from Felicity.\nShe wonders how much of the past is worth clinging to.\nSee how the gilded Heavens are covered\nWith the burning bitter tears of our departed\nCast away into darkness, they contradict no truths\nMade mute and absent, they denounce no lies\nAnshi gave this poem into our keeping on the night after her daughter left her. She was crying then, trying not to show it\u2014muttering about ungrateful children, and their inability to comprehend any of what their ancestors had gone through. Her hand shook, badly; and she stared into her cup of tea, as hard as she had once stared into the black hole and its currents, dragging everything into the lightless depths. But then, as on Shattered Pine, the only thing that came to her was merciless clarity, like the glint of a blade or a claw.\nIt is an old, old composition, its opening lines the last Anshi wrote on Felicity Station. Just as the first poem defined her youth\u2014the escaped prisoner, the revolution\u2019s foremost bot-handler\u2014this defined her closing decades, in more ways than one.\nThe docks were deserted; not because it was early in the station\u2019s cycle, not because the war had diminished interstellar travel; but because the docks had been cordoned off by Mheng loyalists. They gazed at Anshi, steadily\u2014their eyes blank; though the mob behind them brandished placards and howled for her blood.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Nhu said. She was carrying Anshi\u2019s personal belongings\u2014Anshi\u2019s bots, and those of all her followers, were already packed in the hold of the ship. Anshi held her daughter Mingxia by the hand: the child\u2019s eyes were wide, but she didn\u2019t speak. Anshi knew she would have questions, later\u2014but all that mattered, here and now, was surviving this. \u201cYou\u2019re a heroine of the uprising. You shouldn\u2019t have to leave like a branded criminal.\u201d\nAnshi said nothing. She scanned the crowd, wondering if Zhiying would be there, at the last\u2014if she\u2019d smile and wish her well, or make one last stab of the knife. \u201cShe\u2019s right, in a way,\u201d she said, wearily. The crowd\u2019s hatred was palpable, even where she stood. \u201cThe bots are a remnant of the San-Tay, just like High Mheng. It\u2019s best for everyone if we forget it all.\u201d Best for everyone but them.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that,\u201d Nhu said.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Not any of that; but she knew what was in Zhiying\u2019s heart, the hatred of the San-Tay that she carried with her\u2014that, to her little sister, she would be nothing more than a collaborator herself\u2014tainted by her use of the enemy\u2019s technology.\n\u201cShe just wants you gone. Because you\u2019re her rival.\u201d\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think like that,\u201d Anshi said, more sharply than she\u2019d intended; and she knew, too, that she didn\u2019t believe that. Zhiying had a vision of the Mheng as strong and powerful; and she\u2019d allow nothing and no one to stand in its way.\nThey were past the cordon now, and the maw of the ship gaped before them\u2014the promise of a life somewhere else, on another planet. Ironic, in a way\u2014the ship was from the San-Tay High Government, seeking amends for their behavior on colonized stations. If someone had ever told her she\u2019d ride one of those as a guest . . .\nNhu, without hesitation, was heading up towards the dark tunnel. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come,\u201d Anshi said.\nNhu rolled her eyes upwards, and made no comment. Like Anshi, she was old guard; a former teacher in the Mheng schools, fluent in High Mheng, and with a limited ability to control the bots. A danger, like Anshi.\nThere was a noise behind them\u2014the beginning of a commotion. Anshi turned; and saw that, contrary to what she\u2019d thought, Zhiying had come.\nShe wore the sash of Honored Leader well; and the stars of Felicity\u2019s new flag were spread across her dress\u2014which was a shorter, less elaborate version of the five-panel ceremonial garb. Her hair had been pulled up in an elegant bun, thrust through with a golden phoenix pin, the first jewel to come out of the station\u2019s new workshops\u2014she was unrecognizable from the gaunt, tall prisoner Anshi remembered, or even from the dark, intense leader of the rebellion years.\n\u201cElder sister.\u201d She bowed to Anshi, but did not come closer; remaining next to her escort of black-clad soldiers. \u201cWe wish you happiness, and good fortune among the stars.\u201d\n\u201cWe humbly thank you, Your Reverence,\u201d Anshi said\u2014keeping the irony, and the hurt from her voice. Zhiying\u2019s eyes were dark, with the same anger Anshi remembered from the night of the Second Ring riots\u2014the night when the girl had died. They stood, staring at each other, and at length Zhiying gestured for Anshi to move.\nAnshi backed away, slowly, pulling her daughter by the hand. She wasn\u2019t sure why she felt . . . drained, as if a hundred bots had been pumping modifiers into her blood, and had suddenly stopped. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d expected\u2014an apology? Zhiying had never been one for it; or for doubts of any kind. But still\u2014\nStill, they\u2019d been on Shattered Pine together; had escaped together; had preached and written the poetry of the revolution, and dared each other to hack into Felicity\u2019s network to spread it into every household, every corridor screen.\nThere should have been something more than a formal send-off; something more than the eyes boring into hers\u2014dark and intense, and with no hint of sorrow or tears.\nWe do not weep for the enemy, Anshi thought; as she turned, and passed under the wide metal arc that led into the ship, her daughter\u2019s hand heavy in hers.\nIn the small antechamber, Wen dons robes of dark blue\u2014those reserved for the mourners who are the closest family to the dead. She can hear, in the distance, the drone of prayers from the priests, and the scuttling of bots on the walls, carrying faint music until the entire structure of the hall seems to echo with it. Slowly, carefully, she rises, and stares at her pale, wan self in the mirror\u2014with coiled bots at its angles, awaiting just an order to awaken and bring her anything she might desire. Abominations, she thinks, uneasily, but it\u2019s hard to see them as something other than alien, incomprehensible.\nNhu is waiting for her at the great doors\u2014the crowd has parted, letting her through with an almost religious hush. In silence, Wen kneels, her head bent down\u2014an honor to the dead, an acknowledgement that she is late and that she must make amends, for leaving Grandmother\u2019s ghost alone.\nShe hears a noise as the doors open\u2014catches a flash of a crowd dressed in blue; and then she is crawling towards the coffin, staring at the ground ahead of her. By her side, there are glimpses of dresses\u2019 hems, of shoes that are an uneasy meld of San-Tay and Mheng. Ahead, a steady drone from the monks at the pulpit, taken up by the crowd; a prayer in High Mheng, incomprehensible words segueing into a melodious chant; and a smell of incense mingled with something else, a flower she cannot recognize. The floor under her is warm, soft\u2014unlike Felicity\u2019s utilitarian metal or carpets, a wealth of painted ostentation with patterns she cannot make out.\nAs she crawls, Wen finds herself, incongruously, thinking of Mother.\nShe asked, once, why Mother had left San-Tay Prime\u2014expecting Mother to rail once more at Grandmother\u2019s failures. But Mother merely pulled a low bench, and sat down with a sigh. \u201cThere was no choice, child. We could dwindle away on San-Tay Prime, drifting further and further away from Felicity with every passing moment. Or we could come back home.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Grandmother\u2019s home,\u201d Wen said, slowly, confusedly\u2014with a feeling that she was grappling with something beyond her years.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mother said. \u201cAnd, if we had waited too long, it wouldn\u2019t have been your home either.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Wen put a hand on one of the kitchen cupboards\u2014the door slid away, letting her retrieve a can of dried, powdered shrimp, which she dumped into the broth on the stove.\n\u201cLike two men carried away by two different currents in the river\u2014both ending in very different places.\u201d She waved a dismissive hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand, when you\u2019re older.\u201d\n\u201cIs that why you\u2019re not talking with Grandmother?\u201d\nMother grimaced, staring into the depths of her celadon cup. \u201cGrandmother and I . . . did not agree on things,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I think . . . \u201d She shook her head. \u201cStubborn old woman. She never could admit that she had lost. That the future of Felicity wasn\u2019t with bots, with High Mheng; with any of what the San-Tay had left us.\u201d\nBots. High Mheng\u2014all of the things that don\u2019t exist anymore, on the new Felicity\u2014all the things the Honored Leader banished, for the safety and glory of the people. \u201cMother . . . \u201d Wen said, suddenly afraid.\nHer mother smiled; and for the first time Wen saw the bitterness in her eyes. \u201cNever mind, child. This isn\u2019t your burden to carry.\u201d\nWen did not understand. But now . . . now, as she crawls down the aisle, breathing in the unfamiliar smells, she thinks she understands. Reconciliation means forgetfulness, and is it such a bad thing that they forget, that they are no longer chained to the hatreds of the past?\nShe reaches the coffin, and rises\u2014turns, for a brief moment, to stare at the sea of humanity before her\u2014the blurred faces with bots at the corner of their eyes, with alien scents and alien clothes. They are not from Felicity anymore, but something else\u2014poised halfway between the San-Tay and the culture that gave them birth; and, as the years pass, those that do not come back will drift further and further from Felicity, until they will pass each other in the street, and not feel anything but a vague sense of familiarity, like long-lost families that have become strangers to each other.\nNo, not from Felicity anymore\u2014and does it matter, any of it?\nWen has no answer\u2014none of Mother\u2019s bleak certainties about life. And so she turns away from the crowd, and looks into the coffin\u2014into the face of a stranger, across a gap like a flowing river, dark and forever unbridgeable.\nI am in halves, dreaming of a faraway home\nNot a dry spot on my moonlit pillow\nThrough the open window lies the stars and planets\nWhere ten thousand family members have scattered\nAlong the River of Heaven, with no bridges to lead them home\nThe long yearning\nCuts into my heart\nThis is the last poem we received from Xu Anshi; the last one she composed, before the sickness ate away at her command of High Mheng, and we could no longer understand her subvocalized orders. She said to us then, \u201cit is done\u201d; and turned away from us, awaiting death.\nWe are here now, as Wen looks at the pale face of her grandmother. We are not among our brethren in the crowd\u2014not clinging to faces, not curled on the walls or at the corner of mirrors, awaiting orders to unfold.\nWe have another place.\nWe rest on the coffin with Xu Anshi\u2019s other belongings; scattered among the paper offerings\u2014the arch leading into the Heavens, the bills stamped with the face of the King of Hell. We sit quiescent, waiting for Xu Wen to call us up\u2014that we might flow up to her like a black tide, carrying her inheritance to her, and the memories that made up Xu Anshi\u2019s life from beginning to end.\nBut Wen\u2019s gaze slides right past us, seeing us as nothing more than a necessary evil at the ceremony; and the language she might summon us in is one she does not speak and has no interest in.\nIn silence, she walks away from the coffin to take her place among the mourners\u2014and we, too, remain silent, taking our understanding of Xu Anshi\u2019s life into the yawning darkness.\n\"With apologies to Qiu Jin, Bei Dao and the classical\nTang poets for borrowing and twisting their best lines\"\nAliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

I had one I thought would work, but it fizzled and went in the wrong direction. In a moment of desperation, I turned to Twitter:\n Over the course of the next few hours, responses\u2014serious and not\u2014rolled in. So far, there have been a couple of really good ideas, but they require a bit of research and more time than I have this late in the month. Many of the others were interesting, but didn\u2019t immediately inspire a whole editorial\u2019s worth of content. However, perhaps it would be fun to treat them collectively and cobble together a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of an editorial from some of them.\n Gav Thorpe @GavThorpeCreate: 'Why do magazines have editorials?'\n Oh that\u2019s easy. They were put in place to torture the editors, particularly those who don\u2019t write. Same thing with blogs and introductions in anthologies. Apparently, it\u2019s supposed to make it look like we actually work, aren\u2019t robots, you know, something like that.\n Joan Wendland @BandCgames: The future of dystopian novels given the current dystopia we experience every day?\n Can\u2019t talk to novels, but with short fiction, I\u2019m not seeing much of a change in the slush pile. I did note a ten percent decline in story submissions immediately following the election, but it\u2019s almost back to October levels now. If people are learning anything from all this, I\u2019m not seeing it applied in the stories. That\u2019s fine though, cause I like that people still prefer using their imagination.\n John P. Murphy @dolohov: Optimism in science fiction?\n There have been complaints about the lack of optimism in science fiction for many years now. Months ago, maybe at the Nebula Conference, I was talking to someone about this. They seemed to believe that optimistic science fiction is very tied to economic situation and overall happiness with their lives. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s data out there on this, but I haven\u2019t taken the time to see if that theory was true. I have some doubts.\n Frabjous the Elder @timothy_boothe: Why do computers in sci-fi always just look like the computers when the sci-fi was written?\n Computer science major here. It\u2019s called a lack of imagination and it bugs me too. I shouldn\u2019t be impressed anytime someone gets a simple hacker-type character or even basic terminology right either.\n Marion Deeds @mariond_d: WorldCon has a panel; \u201cCats in popular culture.\u201d What about cats in SFF?\n Sorry, I\u2019m a dog person. I just don\u2019t get the whole cat thing. They seem mean to me, but what do you expect from a shrunken lion? It\u2019s going to have issues. Or did you mean authors named Cat? If so, I like those.\n Ziv W @QuiteVague: The effect of Twitter on the fandom ecosystem.\n Complicated. Like any tool it can be used for good and evil. That said, I don\u2019t think there is a single fandom ecosystem.\n Sabrina M. Pyun @sabrinampyun: Should sci-fi reflect people's current mindsets about the future or should sci-fi inspire/change those mindsets?\n It can do either or neither. There\u2019s plenty of room under the umbrella and more than just those two choices. Don\u2019t tie yourself down.\n Susan E. Connolly @susanconnolly: How important is realism in SF? Can we still write stories with aliens on Mars?\n As I said above, there\u2019s lots of room under the umbrella. I like hard SF and I like stuff that isn\u2019t. Of course you can write stories with aliens on Mars. You can even write a hard SF story with aliens on Mars if you set it up correctly. Just because they aren\u2019t there now doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be someday.\n Mike Caputo @MichaelNCaputo: The death of science under the current administration.\n Science can be denied, not stopped.\n Stephen S. Power @Stephenspower: Is the future above ground or below?\n It depends on how much money you have, though I\u2019ve been thinking lately that it might be under water.\n clive tern @CliveTernWriter: How Gattaca is a great film representing marginalization of disability, but used non-disabled actors.\n I\u2019ll have to take your word for it since I haven\u2019t seen that movie. Hmmm. Maybe I should watch a bunch of genre movies I haven\u2019t seen yet and write an editorial around that.\n Passenger EU @LorcaIan: How to get published in your mag\n Like the lottery, you have to be in it to win it. Unlike the lottery, the stories aren\u2019t picked randomly. What makes me think a story is good? That\u2019s a question I\u2019m still not sure how to answer and even if I could, I\u2019d never recommend that you write based on that answer. Write what you enjoy and write it well.\n Emily Swaim @swaimea: Return of the novella as a storytelling medium, in regards to companion stories for franchises and the popularity of Japanese light novels\n I can\u2019t speak with much experience about the Japanese light novels, but the return of the novella is a rather nice development. You might have noticed that we\u2019ve snuck in a few in the that last couple of years. For us, it\u2019s always been a budget and space issue and I\u2019d love to do more. In some ways, the novella is just catching the tail-end of what caused the increase in short fiction readership in recent years: online and digital publishing. I\u2019ll single Tor.com and Tachyon Publications as two publishers that have made a mark with their novellas. More will follow.\n Richard J. O'Brien @obrienwriter: Why so many sci-fi characters are not memorable compared to other genres.\n My experience has been quite the opposite. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d find a consensus on this one and that\u2019s probably a good thing. It means there\u2019s still good variety out there and so many more variations on stories left to tell. If the characters today aren\u2019t to your liking, be the author that fixes that.\n Well, that was a fun little experiment. Did any of those topics speak to you or did you want to toss me another? Feel free to drop comments off at our website or even via Twitter. Maybe we can make this a bit like the old-timey letters-to-the-editor columns. Might be a fun thing to do from time-to-time!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

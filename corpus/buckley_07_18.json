The spiral went crazy for a while, shooting, soldiers at the corners. But then, like everyone knows, it went back to normal.\nBy twenty I was looking for ghosts in the vaults. I\u2019m not the youngest to have gone into the vaults; there was a girl a few years ago, like twelve years old or something.\nMaybe not the youngest, and maybe not the best, but I\u2019ve brought a lot of ghosts back from the vaults. Close to fifty.\nWhich is what Ginz reminds me of when he\u2019s trying to get me to do something.\n\u201cFifty ghosts, Irvine. Or is it more?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s less.\u201d\nGinz shrugs.\n\u201cBut the quality. The ghosts you\u2019ve brought back have taught us more about Origin Earth than the ghosts that any other five vault divers have brought back, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it you want, Ginz?\u201d\nHe smiles and cocks his head. A pack of cigarettes is the ubiquitous six inches from his left hand. He grabs.\n\u201cCare for one?\u201d\nI shake my head, and after the click of the lighter, an infant storm cloud is hovering around Ginz\u2019s pristine face. Only his eyes betray the way he lives. They\u2019re angry, infected pits beneath his smooth forehead.\n\u201cI want you to take someone in,\u201d he says.\nMy thoughts flash. There are only a few interns. Not Emmy, he can\u2019t mean her.\nHe reads me through the smoke and nods.\n\u201cYeah. Emmy.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s a kid, Ginz. What is she?\u201d\n\u201cFourteen.\u201d\nHe sips from a coffee cup and exhales a whiskey reek.\n\u201cShe tests high. And she\u2019s interned with us for three years. She\u2019s going in, with or without you.\u201d\nI shrug. This is another thing about Ginz: his flattery, properly speaking, isn\u2019t persuasion. Orders always follow his compliments.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be so bad. There are sightings of a ghost pretty shallow, looks like a simple walk-it-home job. I sent the details.\u201d\nGinz sets his cigarette down and his eyes clear.\n\u201cHow old were you when the viz came?\u201d\n\u201cSixteen.\u201d\nHe smiles and shakes his head.\n\u201cPerfect. Go in tomorrow.\u201d\nYou don\u2019t go into the vaults, they go into you. The technology was probably old when we arrived, and probably still exists on Origin Earth in some form. No doubt their vaults make ours look bad. We\u2019re a hundred years removed from landing.\nBack then, the first colonists called the vaults the library. It was their history. Anyone could use the immersion couches and slip into the program of Origin Earth\u2019s past. It was both education and history for the people in the spiral, and everyone lived happily ever after in the beautiful spiral, so it goes, so happily that they just lost interest in the library, and only a select few care anymore.\nWhat they tell you when you start as a vault diver, though, is that it didn\u2019t happen that way. Sixty years ago the library was education and history and eventually became brighter, for most people, than the real life of the spiral. There aren\u2019t that many immersion couches, and people fought over them, and formed up gangs with names vaguely familiar to any diver: The Mongol Madmen, Black Belt Laser Throat Slicers, Werewolf Supernovas, The Blood Drinking George Washingtons. They take a little history from the virtual world of the library, add a few words to scare people, and predictably, war broke out between the gangs, all of them trying to control the library.\nThe Vault Divers\u2014it was a gang name then, not the profession it is now\u2014won.\nVault divers were mostly historians. That\u2019s what they tell you, and they didn\u2019t want to use the library for distraction\u2014or even studying history. They were obsessed with studying the library to learn more about Origin Earth, finding the bits of the program that revealed its makers, and if we studied them enough, might tell us more about why we were here in the spiral.\nThey were seekers of truth, is what we tell ourselves, and so we are seekers of truth too, finding ghosts and examining them. And no one else, those descendants of the gangs that wanted the library just for themselves, gets to go in anymore. Just after we won all those years ago we renamed the library the vaults, and that\u2019s how we treat them. Vault divers will tell you that it\u2019s for the best; if your average citizen of the spiral could go in, it would all happen again: they\u2019d never want to leave, and they\u2019d fight to stay, and here we are, just animals fighting over something pretty.\nThe brightest, the most curious, maybe the ones who hate the spiral so much it\u2019s impossible not to seek the lit cracks\u2014that\u2019s me, I guess\u2014become vault divers. I\u2019m not sure what Emmy is yet. Curious; afraid; tired of the darkness of the spiral: There\u2019s only so many reasons to dive.\nI meet her outside the controller\u2019s office. She\u2019s dressed up, but in a way that seems casual\u2014a clean, ironed shirt, loose pants. She\u2019d be nervous. She\u2019d have heard horrors and glories about the vaults since she was a baby. And she\u2019d have developed her own theories as she interned for us, cataloguing the reports that vault divers like me brought back. She\u2019s probably even met some of the ghosts we brought back.\nShe says hi and I ignore her. In the controller\u2019s office they pull the dustcovers off of the couches. Lights dance beneath the translucent surface of each couch, and I settle in, closing my eyes as I do. I suppose Emmy does the same. The controller doesn\u2019t say a thing as he kicks up the sensory interface. He knows that none of us like small talk, and then the construct pours all around me.\nEmmy and I are standing in a bare brown room.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d It\u2019s the first thing I have said to her.\n\u201cSomehow I didn\u2019t picture it this way.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the load space. The controller is checking to see if we\u2019re tuned in.\u201d\nHer eyes are shining. A blemish near her nostril is swollen and pink. It must hurt. Funny that I hadn\u2019t noticed it outside when I was actually in her presence.\n\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asks.\nI gesture and the information that Ginz sent springs up.\n\u201cVault fifty. It\u2019s pretty shallow.\u201d\n\u201cFifty is one of the culture vaults, right?\u201d\n\u201cSubcultures. Newest subculture to oldest\u2014the deeper we go, the older.\u201d\n\u201cHow far back does it go?\u201d\nI raise my eyebrows: She knows this as well as I do.\n\u201cFifty thousand years. This vault links to the larger culture ones, and has sims all the way back to Neolithic burial mounds.\u201d\nI look at the search terms that Ginz included with the brief. Before I can say them I check with Emmy.\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d\nShe nods.\n\u201cTwenty one forty five, Welk Island, East Coast of North America.\u201d\nThe plain construct disappears. We are standing on a shore. Hills above us are covered in cinder block structures on long plastic legs. Holo ads flicker between them. Behind us cold seawater drags pebbles back and forth.\nKnowing that Emmy will start asking questions, I begin up the hill. She follows. We find a path right away. The Welk Island kids must sneak down to the water at night; the path here is well-worn, but there\u2019s a wooden staircase a quarter mile down the beach, the kind of thing the adults would use. Once we\u2019re in the town we\u2019re walking between empty structures. It\u2019s quiet, only the wind and the distant water.\nEmmy grunts behind me. She\u2019s looking into one of the houses, and there are figures inside it now, and paragraphs of glowing text floating away from the structure, explaining the people inside. They\u2019ll be slaver gangs if I remember correctly, having shown up with stolen weapons after the collapse of central authority in Washington somewhere near 2140. They were like Vikings with machine guns, and sold whole towns to their neighbors for all kinds of awful things. Flashing images elaborate the floating paragraphs.\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe vault reads your look as curiosity.\u201d\n\u201cI am curious.\u201d\n\u201cThen go study postwar flesh economies. We\u2019re here to get a ghost.\u201d\nWe walk past the end of the street and amble up a trail. The trail leads up into very green hills and over fields of windblown grass. Finally the grass recedes and bare stone hills appear, and after cresting them we descend down into valleys choked with jagged black rocks. And then back up again. Finally, after walking most of the day, we see a small wooden cabin centered in a prairie.\n\u201cSit,\u201d I say.\nEmmy does, and I sit next to her. I watch the cabin, and think about what might be inside. This brings to mind the worst ghosts I\u2019ve ever seen. A man, no skin and no eyes, sockets packed with ash, teeth grinding until they crack, standing in the corner of a butcher shop. He was the third I brought in.\nI know Emmy\u2019s wondering, but she doesn\u2019t say a word, so I say it for her.\n\u201cYou hear bad things, but they\u2019re pretty rare. Usually ghosts are just boring.\u201d\n\u201cSo why are we sitting up here just watching?\u201d\n\u201cI want it to see us first.\u201d I gesture to the grassy ridge we were on, in silhouette against the gray sky. \u201cGhosts are weird. Sometimes if you surprise them they act out. Run or fight.\u201d\nEmmy forces a laugh. \u201cBut they can\u2019t hurt us.\u201d\n\u201cNo. We\u2019re in the vaults. None of this is real.\u201d\nThat isn\u2019t entirely true, of course. If you are attacked by a ghost you can\u2019t be hurt, but the connection between the vault software and your limbic system could be damaged. It could leave ragged edges. That\u2019s why some of the vault old timers have weird coughs or wear diapers.\nEmmy raises her fingertips to her face and brushes her lips. It\u2019s endearing.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten your viz yet.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAre you worried?\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I be?\u201d\nI nod.\n\u201cExactly right.\u201d\nFingers move, she brushes her lip again. She is worried, and she is looking at me out of the corner of her eye, as if she can tell something about me and my own viz just by looking.\nFar below, the door of the cabin opens, and a face appears for a moment.\n\u201cThere he is,\u201d I say.\nWe stand up and make our way down to the cabin. By the time we get there swollen raindrops are pattering the bare stones around us. Emmy looks at me.\n\u201cDo we knock?\u201d\nI shrug.\nThe door opens just as my knuckles make contact. Seeing the ghost Emmy gasps, but tries to swallow the sound even as she makes it. The man who opens the door is large and hunched over, his head near the rough-hewn rafters. His skin is shiny like the crust forming over an active infection.\n\u201cMind if we have a seat?\u201d I ask.\nThe ghost looks at me earnestly, then creeps its large body backward carefully. At last it eases into one of the wooden chairs. A pad of paper is in front of the chair, a single circle scribbled onto it enough to shred the paper.\n\u201cThe third wave of settlers to Welk Island were slaver gangs from neighboring seasteads. Did you see them when you passed through the village?\u201d\nThe ghost looked at both of us closely, its long face glistening.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fine,\u201d I say.\n\u201cSlaver gangs are known to punish recalcitrant members by forcibly copulating with them. The resulting children are sold to the seasteads.\u201d\n\u201cThey sound unpleasant,\u201d I say.\n\u201cNot as unpleasant as the second wave settlers were. They . . . \u201d\n\u201cListen,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s someone you have to meet.\u201d\nThe ghost\u2019s eyes shift back and forth between Emmy and I.\n\u201cThe slaver gangs?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Someone not on Welk Island.\u201d\nThe ghost\u2019s eyelids stretch as if trying to contain its eyeballs.\n\u201cNot on, Welk Island, you say? Are they from the seasteads?\u201d\n\u201cNot there either.\u201d\nThe ghost stares and then stands up. A moment later Emmy and I are leading the ghost back up the hill, and tepid, heavy raindrops are falling on its mottled skin.\nYou sometimes hear the old vault divers say that they have trouble knowing if they\u2019re in a vault or in the real world. They\u2019re full of shit. The spiral stinks. The vaults don\u2019t. It\u2019s that simple: If it reeks, it\u2019s real.\nBack in the stink, Emmy and I walk up the spiral. It\u2019s early evening. Someone is shouting and the sound echoes through the rough metallic surfaces. The sound of water dripping is everywhere.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start interviewing it tomorrow,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\nI shrug.\n\u201cThe ghosts you find in culture vaults are usually pretty simple information oversight programs. When they loaded the vaults they put these programs into be, sort of, librarians.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do they look like that?\u201d\n\u201cSome imperfection grandfathered in. Over the years it grew, degrading the program\u2019s appearance. Most of the ghosts are what they are because they have a limited ability to evolve, and some trace of their programmer\u2019s personality was accidentally left in them. Our job is to treat them like historical artifacts.\u201d\nI hear Ginz\u2019s voice. It\u2019s ringing up a dark street, part of the spiral that I walk every day and hate each time. It\u2019s abandoned here, dank, dangerous. Ginz\u2019s voice is all vowels. Drunk.\n\u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d I ask.\nThankfully she points away from Ginz\u2019s voice.\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk you,\u201d I say.\nEmmy\u2019s neighborhood is lined in makeshift garbage torches. People lie collapsed here and there, wet, filthy, and scrawny except for their pristine faces. They look as young as Emmy, some of them, except better\u2014their smooth cheeks have an inner glow, a smoothness that I still, after all these years, am not used to.\nGinz is still shouting behind us, far down some dark avenue, so I try to make conversation.\n\u201cWhat got you into vault diving?\u201d\nShe shrugs like she doesn\u2019t want to say.\nWe pass another block of structures. To our left people are huddled around a small fire, and they look at us as we pass, their faces flickering with light like magical ovals.\nI don\u2019t like it.\nAnd here\u2019s why: I hear a foot scuff lightly on the corner ten feet behind us, as if in quickening step, and I turn. The foot is connected to a skinny, hard-looking man and he\u2019s running at us, arm raised. I turn and catch the arm and thrust him against the wall. Up close he stinks and is strong and rolls me and now he has me against the wall and the raised arm is jabbing something sharp at me. It catches my left elbow and stings and in reflex I throw a short punch. It catches the man in the throat and he stumbles and I follow so he can\u2019t recover, punching at him, hitting his skull, his ear, hurting my hands more than I hurt him, but it distracts him, and I hear his weapon hit the ground. I pick it up quick while he\u2019s stumbling and swing wide. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m holding until it cuts into his face\u2014it\u2019s a piece of jagged metal\u2014and opens him, cheekbone to chin. His hands come to his face, so I stab at his forehead, his temples, and when he covers those, I slice his cheeks again. The metal is good for it. Blood pours, and the thin man turns, stumbles, and runs.\nI turn and look at Emmy. She\u2019s watching the people who had been around the fire. They\u2019re closer now, in a half-circle.\nI hold up the piece of metal and point it at the closest one.\n\u201cBack up. You aren\u2019t getting shit.\u201d\nWe keep walking, me looking over my shoulder, and finally when we round a corner, at my hands, which are spotted in blood.\n\u201cYou know him?\u201d\nEmmy shrugs.\n\u201cHe\u2019s at that corner all the time. I think he knows I work in the vaults.\u201d\nI shake my head. What some people think about the vaults\u2014that we vault divers are rich, or get extra food rations. It\u2019s beyond me.\nEmmy\u2019s house is another block down. It must\u2019ve been abandoned by the owner. She\u2019s living in it alone. She has the place organized, though. Stacks of neatly-folded clothes, a row of books along the wall. They\u2019re warped and swollen. She must\u2019ve found them on the street.\n\u201cSit,\u201d she says, pointing at the floor, so I do. She sits opposite me.\n\u201cCan I touch?\u201d she asks.\nIt makes me uncomfortable, but I can\u2019t really say why.\n\u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in three years.\u201d\n\u201cAll right. Touch.\u201d\nWhy not, I think. It\u2019s harmless. It\u2019s not even me.\nEmmy comes up on her knees and leans closer. Her fingers brush my face, down over my brow to my chin, and then over the tender skin beneath my eyes.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cYes. Badly, but not for long.\u201d\nEmmy draws her hand back and involuntarily wipes her fingers on her pant leg.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d\nI shrug.\n\u201cSo? A viz will come either way. Maybe there\u2019s one in the house already.\u201d\nHaving grown up in this part of the spiral, Emmy\u2019s a hard girl, so she doesn\u2019t flinch when I say it. But something changes. I know that I should comfort her, tell her some reassuring version of the truth, remind her that it\u2019s something everyone goes through, and we all turned out OK, right?\nBut just now I can\u2019t. I feel shaky from the fight and mad at Emmy for no reason I can name.\n\u201cMeet me at the vaults tomorrow,\u201d I say, and walk out of the room.\nBefore I go home, though, I stand across the street from Emmy\u2019s house, watching her draw fabric across the empty windows, and I tell myself I\u2019m standing there to make sure she is safe.\nFor some vault divers, the clich\u00e9s are true\u2014we\u2019d rather live in the past; Origin Earth holds an odd pull on us; we\u2019re uncomfortable around the living.\nThose all fit me, but I first wanted to be a vault diver because I knew I\u2019d learn more about Origin Earth. When I was about ten I remember my teacher giving us The Dead Planet lesson. That\u2019s what we are on, a rock called V0-563. There isn\u2019t so much as a drop of liquid water on the surface; it is a frozen rock. This was before the viz came, of course. They count as a life-form. Which makes me wonder if in school these days there\u2019s a Face Parasite lesson as well as a Dead Planet one.\nBack then, she went on telling us just how frozen VO-563 is, and just how dead. Fifty years of expeditions hadn\u2019t found anything on the planet\u2019s surface: flat, dead, and frozen until the miles curve back on themselves; now, of course, we don\u2019t even bother going out. We have no idea or record of why our ship was sent here, or idea of what it is our colony was supposed to do. Were our ancestors fleeing something? If they were, none of them wrote it down or talked about it, and although there are famous blank spots in the vault\u2019s record\u2014one a hundred years in, most notably\u2014they don\u2019t tell us much.\nI\u2019ve spent so much time in the vaults, in so many historic periods, in so many places, that it\u2019s hard not to feel like I\u2019m from Origin Earth, and that the spiral, and the people in it, are the dream. At moments like that, something like a viz falls away from my mind, revealing the mess of what I really think: the spiral is filled with animals all looking to fight and fuck and birth and do it again before dying. People barely even talk about the viz, unless they are Emmy\u2019s age, and soon to receive theirs. The rest of us forget the agony, forget that the beautiful thing we look at in the mirror isn\u2019t really our face. We forget that we are from somewhere else and we don\u2019t know why we\u2019re here, in this pit.\nSo this is how it seems to me: They\u2019re not clich\u00e9s. Any person with a heart would rather live in the past. The vaults should hold an attraction for us. And if the living are the things walking around this dark spiral, can you blame me for wanting to be around the dead?\nThe next day, on my way into the vaults, I see Ginz turning up a side street. His clothes are stained and his hair hangs thin and filthy over his beautiful face. He\u2019s hunching to light a cigarette, and grunts at me, and I know it means he wants me to stop and wait for him.\nI do, and he blows smoke vertical and hits me on the shoulder.\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYou mean how was it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou met the ghost, right?\u201d\nGinz doesn\u2019t say anything, and we walk toward the vaults. I can see that his hand is trembling as he raises the cigarette to his lips.\n\u201cIt was fine,\u201d I say, knowing that he\u2019s really asking me about the vaults, and not the man that tried to roll Emmy and me, or about Emmy\u2019s fear of the viz, or her dark, little apartment. \u201cThe ghost we pulled wasn\u2019t anything special. At least not that I can tell right now. We\u2019ll see when we interrogate him.\u201d\n\u201cJust some shallow dweller. Probably nothing to report.\u201d\n\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d\nGinz flicks his cigarette into the street and I follow it with my eyes. It\u2019s nearly empty out right now, and the light strips along the roof of the spiral are crackling and popping into life. Following the trajectory that the cigarette would\u2019ve taken if Ginz had flicked it harder, my eyes fell onto the thin man from last night. The wounds were almost invisible\u2014just a slight indentation along his cheek, a couple subtle divots on his forehead where his viz had healed overnight.\nHe\u2019s staring, and his eyes feel like match flames a little too close to my own eyes.\nI wink at him, and he looks down, and walks down an alley.\n\u201cKeep me in the loop, yeah?\u201d Ginz says. I can\u2019t tell if he noticed the thin man, but in the exhausted state he is in, I doubt it.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d a voice says behind me. It\u2019s Emmy, and she smiles at me, and looks at Ginz with a half smile.\nInside the loading construct, the ghost is seated at one of the chairs, looking uncomfortable, too big for the room.\n\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d I ask Emmy, testing.\n\u201cWe interview the ghost.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo try and identify whether there are artifacts present in it.\u201d\n\u201cRight. How good are you with the code?\u201d\nI haven\u2019t seen Emmy do this before: She smiles and raises her palms like she can\u2019t put how good she is into words.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\nIn the waiting room, Emmy and I take seats across from the ghost and Emmy erects her code splicer on the table in front of her. The ghost smiles.\n\u201cI remember you both,\u201d it says.\n\u201cFrom Welk Island, right?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d it says to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as Third Wave settlers. Are you visitors?\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what we are. Visitors.\u201d\nWe start by analyzing the ghost\u2019s appearance. To set it at ease I ask about Welk Island fauna. As it answers Emmy steps closer to it with a set of goggles pulled down over her eyes.\nThe ghost stops on trees: \u201c . . . Pine, largely\u2014what is she doing?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s her job.\u201d\n\u201cIs she a doctor?\u201d\nThe ghost watches Emmy scan her goggled eyes over its skin.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say. \u201cGo on about trees.\u201d\nThe ghost does. First the trees that were catalogued on Welk Island when it was constructed off the coast of Maine. The fill Welk Island is built on consisted of the ruins of a city, the ghost says, although it doesn\u2019t say which one or what happened to it.\nEmmy continues her examination of the ghost as it talks and I watch her out of the corner of my eye. A blush appears on her cheek and she looks over her shoulder at me.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d I say to the ghost. \u201cCan we finish this discussion after lunch?\u201d\nIt nods and closes its eyes, as if it\u2019s just going to sit there and rest.\nOutside, Emmy opens her mouth but I hold a finger up and lead her down the hall and out into the courtyard. It\u2019s empty and looks like it always has been\u2014a black wrought iron fence surrounding a bare patch of concrete.\n\u201cFind something?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nThe blush has met the edges of her lips and Emmy is still looking at me like she doesn\u2019t know how to say what she wants to say.\n\u201cSo what is it?\u201d\n\u201cSonic tremor. And evidence of patchworking.\u201d\n\u201cBoth?\u201d\nShe nods her head and I shake mine.\n\u201cThe rarity of those, Emmy. Each one is a thousand to one. Both is impossible.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know? Didn\u2019t Ginz tell you what I did before he sent me into the vaults?\u201d\nI nod, because Ginz probably had told me, or at least posted it on a file or something. But I have no idea.\nShe can tell, too: \u201cI was a full-time code analyst. I\u2019ve seen every bit of sonic tremor and every patchwork that we have found in the last three years. I know it\u2019s impossible, but still, it\u2019s there.\u201d\nI shrug.\n\u201cPull it and check it out.\u201d\nEmmy makes a face that means to me that she\u2019d intended to pull it and check it out and hates that I suggested it, and then she disappears back into the building, and I\u2019m standing in the little patio all by myself. In a moment Ginz appears, a smoke between his lips.\n\u201cGhost give you anything?\u201d\n\u201cEmmy thinks so.\u201d\n\u201cNot you?\u201d\nGinz lights his smoke and puffs on it.\nI shrug. \u201cI\u2019m already tired.\u201d\nGinz smiles and immediately I regret saying that\u2014he\u2019s looking for an excuse to get away, and here it is.\n\u201cReality, Gently Sharpened by Tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re going with me, and we\u2019re gonna drink there, and you\u2019re gonna tell your life story.\u201d\n\u201cShit, man. I can\u2019t.\u201d\nGinz does a slow motion shrug, like he knows it\u2019s natural to struggle in the jaws of a larger, stronger animal, and also knows that it will fail.\n\u201cWhere you got to go? Where does anybody got to go?\u201d\nTen minutes later we are walking away from the vaults, leaving Emmy to analyze the interesting bits she had found in the code. Reality, Gently Sharpened by Tragedy is a spiral within the spiral: Through the front door, which is open but blocked by a large man, and down steps. The whole bar is steps. To the left on the descending spiral is the bar itself, which is steps too, at waist level. In a moment I\u2019m standing next to Ginz, holding a cup of whiskey, and he is standing on the step above me, holding whiskey also, talking about something that is both uncertain and very sad. Ginz talks and drinks come and empty cups go and people pass by, walking down stairs, into the darkness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all an abject, heartbreaking, hilarious tragedy.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean the . . . ?\u201d I intentionally don\u2019t finish the sentence so Ginz could finish it himself, but he sweeps his right hand in a sloppy arc, indicating that it is all a tragedy. The bar; the spiral; the vaults; humanity.\nI open my mouth to agree with him, because in this state there is no argument against what he is saying, but then Ginz\u2019s face turns to blood. Striated muscle and exposed eye sockets. Teeth rictused and still talking because they don\u2019t know they are dead yet. Then his eyes snap away from mine and focus on something behind me and he falls forward into my arms, dead. I let him go straight onto the stairs, thudding down like so much meat, and I watch the edges of the translucence that covers his face begin to detach itself and crawl away into the dim light of Reality. The last thing he sees, I guess, is me standing over him.\nThe morning after Ginz dropped dead we\u2019re all standing in the complex, and I am passing through groups of vault divers, people I know but rarely see, listening to them not express shock at Ginz\u2019s death. As I walk bits of story attach themselves to me: Ginz hadn\u2019t been sober in three years or slept in three months, he\u2019d stabbed someone just up-spiral\u2014ripped his viz to shreds. Of course he had a stroke: It\u2019s a miracle he didn\u2019t die sooner.\nVault divers stand around the complex, talking and waiting to meet the new boss, and I see Emmy near the edge of the group, looking uncomfortable. When I get to her she gives me something like a smile.\n\u201cYou ok?\u201d I ask.\n\u201cYeah. Are you?\u201d\nI shrug.\nA voice calls us to order. A man named Jayay is standing to one side. His expression says he is actively inhaling chemical fumes.\n\u201cOK, divers. Shame about Ginz, right? He was a good man who gave his life to the vaults. Have your moments of silence or raise a drink to him tonight.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIn light of it, we\u2019re shutting down for awhile. Doors closed. Don\u2019t come in. God bless you,\u201d he says, but his expression says curse you.\nWith that he excuses us, waves us all away, and walks back into the waiting room. Most of the divers just stand there, more shocked at being told their job just vanished than at Ginz stroking. There\u2019s anger in the air suddenly, whispering, bodies start pressing.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say to Emmy.\nWe get out of the crowd and move up spiral. It is dim around us but it\u2019s still pretty early, and crowds of people line the streets, and on both sides of us are what passes for shops this deep\u2014shattered windows, people sitting in dark structures, watching the foot traffic on the street.\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying that this new guy Jayay is part of something called The Mongol Madmen.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cSo what does that mean for us?\u201d\n\u201cThat means we be careful.\u201d\nGinz had talked about this a few times. What if, he said, those other gangs didn\u2019t die out sixty years ago? What if they went underground? Bullshit, I\u2019d said, we\u2019d know, and Ginz had smiled his tortured smile. Would we? He\u2019d answered\u2014would we really?\nEmmy sighs.\n\u201cAre you going to ask about the ghost we pulled out?\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the ghost we pulled out?\u201d\nShe starts talking and I look up the spiral. People sit on the windowsills, rough looking, every inch of skin except their vizs tattooed in thick tangles of images. A dozen beautiful, glowing faces looking at Emmy and I: They are Mongol Madmen too.\nEmmy reaches up and takes my ear between her fingers and yanks. The Mongol Madmen along the street laugh.\n\u201cWould you listen to me?\u201d\n\u201cNot here. Let\u2019s go to my place.\u201d\nEmmy shrugs and we walk up spiral. After ten minutes or so the buildings start looking better. The windows are intact, at least. I can smell food cooking. There\u2019s a park that takes up a whole chunk of the spiral. The trees are column-thick at the trunks, and stretch up into the darkness at the top of the tunnel, growing in knobby, hard drapes in all directions.\n\u201cYou live up here?\u201d Emmy asks.\n\u201cYou will too when they hire you for real.\u201d\nThe front door of my apartment is behind one of the massive trees, set in a cape of moss that thrives along this wall. I open it and lights turn up and I offer Emmy a seat.\n\u201cSomething to drink?\u201d I say.\nEmmy nods her head.\n\u201cI\u2019ve isolated the vibratory patterns,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more than I\u2019ve seen before.\u201d\n\u201cSo? How much?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe a sentence or two.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the patching?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet. But this is more than I\u2019ve ever seen, and once we feed it into the algorithm, it could really mean something.\u201d\nI nod.\nEmmy is looking at the walls of my apartment.\n\u201cWhat did it look like when Ginz died?\u201d she asks, running her forefinger down the bridge of her nose.\n\u201cJust like they say. It went translucent just the second before he died.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then it crawled away.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they do.\u201d\nEmmy watches the corners of the room, and I snatch her drink from the side table and finish it.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever been to see the lander?\u201d\nShe shakes her head.\n\u201cNever. Why would I go down there?\u201d\nI don\u2019t answer, and lead her down stairs. The spiral is mostly concerned with itself at this hour, the neighborhoods to either side of us quiet as we walk down and down and finally past the vault complex, which is locked up and has a clot of Mongol Madmen loitering in front.\n\u201cJayay\u2019s people,\u201d Emmy says.\nThe whiskey is warm in my chest and I can\u2019t bring myself to pursue the subject of Jayay.\nInstead, the lander:\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you hear about in school, but Emmy, in person it\u2019s a totally different thing. The lander is half a kilometer long, as tall as the spiral, as wide. The front has blades, drills, grinders.\u201d\nShe looks exhausted by my enthusiasm.\n\u201cThink about the ship arriving, the lander releasing, falling into the atmosphere. The people inside were from Origin Earth, Emmy. Our ancestors.\u201d\nThere are tunnels, I keep on, inside the lander, that were once filled with liquid. The first colonists were immersed in it to cushion them when they hit the rock of Bright Tomorrows and the lander began to dig, making the shape that was most energy efficient for its purpose\u2014a spiral, a place for the colonists to live while they set out exploring the planet and planning their cities.\n\u201cAll this nostalgia is our problem,\u201d Emmy says. \u201cO the lander. O the ship. O Origin Earth. And the colonists? Geniuses. But here we are, only a hundred years later, still living in a pit. The lander a piece of junk. The ship gone.\u201d\nIt strikes me as strange that Emmy should feel this way; she worked in the vaults, after all. She sees it on my face.\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with the code, not the past,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing.\u201d\nA hundred yards past the vault complex even the ruins of structures vanish, and we are walking through a vast stone tunnel on a gentle downgrade. Poles in the middle have lights strung between them. Emmy looks nervous as we walk.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one comes down here.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\nI shrug.\n\u201cYou need to see this, Emmy. It\u2019s history.\u201d\nWe walk another kilometer in silence, down the lit path, and then the ceiling plunges away into darkness, as do the walls. We\u2019re in a vast open space. The lights lead off into the darkness, and just beyond them, I can make out a massive shape.\nUp close the lander is taller than any building in the spiral.\n\u201cIt dug the whole spiral, and then hit this cave system here.\u201d\nThe back of it is a maze of piping and cables. A staircase winds up to a door about thirty feet off of the stone floor.\n\u201cI do not want to go in that thing,\u201d Emmy says.\nThere\u2019s a handheld light hanging on the last light pole. It\u2019s old\u2014held at shoulder level, it mostly just blinds me to the darkness all around us\u2014but there\u2019s no way Emmy is going in that lander without light.\n\u201cYou know what I said when Ginz said I should take you into the vaults?\u201d\n\u201cYes, obviously.\u201d\n\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t do it for anyone else. I see guts in you, I said. I\u2019d do it because of that.\u201d\nEmmy stares up at the black bulk of the lander.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a blunt tool, Irvine.\u201d\n\u201cBut effective?\u201d\nShe takes the light from me and climbs the stairs. They\u2019re solid even after all these years, not so much as a creak as we climb, and in a moment we\u2019re standing at the mouth of the door. Emmy reaches her arm in. Light bathes a perfectly oval hallway. I pass her, taking the torch, and we go deeper inside, through intersections that spread off in five directions, off to the sides but up and down also, at angles it would be hard to walk.\n\u201cAre you going to be able to find your way out?\u201d Emmy asks.\nI raise the lantern to show her the symbols on the walls.\nA few minutes later we emerge into a spherical control room, screens set all around the inside of it. The hallway opens into the side of the sphere, and a path has been worn through the dust by people sliding down the inside of the sphere over the years, and a similar path on the other side where they clamber up.\nI slide and Emmy follows.\nWe make our way up the other side. The oval halls go on for miles, sometimes opening into grand galleries, sometimes plunging out of nowhere straight down, into darkness. The deeper in you go, the more cushioned you are from the distant noise of the spirals, tinny and unbodied because of the stone tunnel, and here, you can really feel Origin Earth. In the lander, we are with the colonists, with their hopes and fears, with their ambition all around us like a vast ghost. The fact that the lander has been stripped over the last hundred years is significant, also. We stripped our forefathers\u2019 machines; we turned them into shop fronts and cobble; even the jagged piece of metal that man tried to stab me with was once part of the lander. Everything in the spiral was meant for something grand.\n\u201cAnd now look at it,\u201d Emmy says, as if she can read my mind.\n\u201cHow did you know what I was thinking?\u201d\nShe waves her hand around the chamber we are in. It is covered on the inside with personnel pods of some sort; the ones within reach are stripped down to bolts.\n\u201cLike I said, Irvine, blunt tool.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say, \u201cone last thing.\u201d\nA hallway leads out of the chamber, and we follow it for a hundred meters, then run into something like a highway. We follow that around a bend, and there it is.\nAcross the breadth of the wall is a huge mural. The colors are magnificent, but muted under years of dust. It stretches up into the darkness.\nEmmy gasps.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s San Francisco, New York, Beijing, London. Karachi. After they landed, Emmy, and the ship drained out, they came back to paint their cities.\u201d\nEmmy wanders forward and I follow. The mural seems to do this, possess you with its size and splendor, as if it were, even more than the vaults, a doorway into the past.\n\u201cIrvine,\u201d Emmy gasps.\nI know, I begin to say, but she is pointing. A man is approaching us, his shoulders hunched up around his ears, his eyes dark.\nI step forward, in front of Emmy.\nHe stops.\nLooking down, away from the mural, I can see three other men around the flicker of a fire. It\u2019s shielded by scrap so the light can\u2019t be seen from far away, and feet stretch away from the fire, splayed in a way that freezes my guts.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I whisper.\nI hear Emmy moving. The man steps forward again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking move,\u201d I shout, and the echo crashes in all directions.\n\u201cI know you,\u201d the man yells back, \u201chigh spiral, vault diver. I know your face.\u201d\nI know him too\u2014or at least what he is. He is covered with the blurry tattoos and ritual scars of a Mongol Madman.\nWe are out of the chamber, in the hallway, and running now. In a moment we are standing by the first of the light poles, looking up at the lander.\n\u201cThey were eating somebody,\u201d Emmy says.\n\u201cTry not to think about it.\u201d\nI touch Emmy\u2019s elbow and lead her back up the lit path.\nBack at my place, I invite Emmy in, have her sit, and go into the kitchen to get two glasses of water. As the tap hisses I think about the man in the darkness and oddly, so oddly, the fact that he said he knows me\u2014not the murder, not the dab of blood I can remember now was on his lower lip\u2014makes me want to kill him.\nI step back into the room carrying the two glasses of water. I feel it like an itch\u2014not something I know until it\u2019s too late, and offering the glass to Emmy, looking at her grateful smile, which is so pure it seems to produce its own light, I realize that something is clinging to the edge of the table. Emmy leans, placing her hand flat in a kind of affect, and the thing moves. It\u2019s on her hand and she screams. Her hand goes to her face and she realizes what it is and yanks it away but it\u2019s already too late. A wet, loose shape is on her face. It is almost the color of her skin, but not quite, and now that it\u2019s where it wants to be, the viz moves fast, stretching over her face before she can stop it.\nShe screams, seizes, slips off the couch.\nI fall on top of Emmy, trying to figure out what to do. As she\u2019s thrashing the viz\u2019s color begins to go translucent and I can see her skin beneath is bubbling, her mouth open, her scream contained by the flesh of the viz. The skin beneath bursts. Blood pops taut against the underside of the viz. Her hands bang on the floor weakly, the muscles underneath the viz straining. Finally the viz goes opaque and slowly withdraws from her mouth and nostrils.\nShe sobs once, quietly.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hurts so much,\u201d she whispers.\n\u201cI know it does,\u201d I say, and sit next to her, taking her into my arms. \u201cI know.\u201d\nHer face is close to what it was, but the viz won\u2019t get it completely right for a week or so. You see teenagers walking around like this sometimes, with a brand new, doughy viz, empty-eyed. As an adult, you laugh about it, call them overly-dramatic. Their viz will learn to match them soon enough, and they\u2019ll forget the pain, like everyone does.\nBut holding Emmy right now, all I can focus on is the fear in her eyes, the claustrophobia. The feeling that she is smothering.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I say, and lift her. We walk together to the couch and I help her lower herself. \u201cStay.\u201d\nI find a half bottle of whiskey and two glasses and I come back and sit across from her and pour.\n\u201cDrink this,\u201d I say, and Emmy does. Either she does not mind the taste or the wince doesn\u2019t make it through the viz. I drink my own quickly then pour Emmy another.\n\u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d\n\u201cIt tingles.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the viz learning your nerves, I think, connecting its thousand tiny mouths to your veins so it can feed.\n\u201cTry not to think about it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid advice, Irvine.\u201d\n\u201cIt sure is.\u201d\n\u201cHow old were you when your viz came?\u201d\n\u201cThey all came when I was sixteen.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re older than I thought.\u201d\n\u201cThe first thing I heard is that a man in one of the tunnels had been attacked. There was a thing on his face. Or was there? People swore he\u2019d been attacked, but in the hospital he looked normal. Of course the viz had their plan. The day after the first attack there was something like four hundred more.\u201d\n\u201cThree seventy five, all that night. All sleeping.\u201d\nI should\u2019ve known Emmy would\u2019ve studied the viz.\n\u201cThen the next day there was shooting. People running everywhere screaming about monsters. They tried to operate on a few people.\u201d\n\u201cOn one. He died.\u201d\nI pour Emmy another drink.\n\u201cIs the pain better?\u201d\nShe nods.\n\u201cGood. And the viz kept coming. Before long we all had one. It\u2019s not so strange. We have parasites in our guts, right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n\u201cDrink,\u201d I say, and pour myself another whiskey. \u201cYou\u2019ll sleep well tonight.\u201d\nThe viz will be linking itself to your thoughts, I think, the better to smile when you mean to smile, and all the rest\u2014the better to look like you, so it can thrive. The first night a viz is on, it will run through expressions. Practicing. The person will be lying there asleep, smiling like a hero, then suddenly heartbroken, then curious, then astonished. It was one of the creepier things about a viz, probably because in those moments you couldn\u2019t fool yourself\u2014the viz had its own mind, its own will.\n\u201cA parade of glasses,\u201d she says, holding up the whiskey glass, her consonants slurring gently.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI like to come up with names for groups of things.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\u201cA complaint of Irvines.\u201d\n\u201cA blaze of Emmys.\u201d\nShe changes tacks:\n\u201cWhat did your parents do?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the viz came?\u201d\nI shrug.\n\u201cThere was a riot. People who hadn\u2019t gotten their viz yet went after people who had. There was fighting in the streets. Murder.\u201d\nThe sadness on her face looks real; her viz is working fast.\n\u201cThey were killed? Irvine, I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Emmy, they were killing. My mother and father both. Chasing people down and burning them, is what I\u2019ve been told. But once enough people got a viz, the rioters weren\u2019t freedom fighters anymore, now they were criminals. Then they burned the criminals. I got my viz a week after they died.\u201d\nA long moment of silence passes between us. There is half a finger of whiskey left in Emmy\u2019s glass. She is holding it against her leg, so relaxed it is almost falling from her fingers.\n\u201cI want to see our Welk Island friend again.\u201d\n\u201cThe Mongol Madmen,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat Jayay did, Emmy, that\u2019s a takeover. You should get your head around it. The vaults don\u2019t belong to us anymore. You might never see our ghost again.\u201d\n\u201cI have a plan,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re really going to hate it.\u201d\nThe vault complex is deep spiral, and at night gets dangerous. People start at the bars and drift down. It\u2019s why the vault complex has always had a fence twice as high as the tallest diver. But, good for us, drunks are dumb, so the fence really never had to be that good.\nI walk the last half block to the vault complex, lean on a tree, and look back at Emmy. She\u2019s covered in filthy rags and she stumbles toward me, around me, and collapses at the fence. I look up and down the block; there\u2019s a group of Mongol Madmen at the front of the complex, laughing and slap-fighting, oblivious.\nI jog over to Emmy.\nShe looks at me out of her pile of filthy rags and shrugs, like how did you know? I shrug back.\nThe hole is at the base of the fence, big enough for one of us to slide under. I can\u2019t see anyone on the other side, so I point for Emmy, and gesture go. She flips over and crawls under, and I follow. In half a minute we\u2019re past the dying trees and next to the vault complex, which is lit up like it\u2019s a workday, but as far as I can tell, empty. We crouch behind the last tree before the complex. I start to whisper something to her\u2014I\u2019d say something about how there\u2019s going to be a lot of bad people in the vault complex, and if we\u2019re going to turn back, and that would be the smartest thing, we should do it now. But looking at her shining eyes I realize my heart is jackhammering. I\u2019m smiling. I haven\u2019t done anything that feels this good in a very long time.\nI get up and run towards the complex, and she follows me. I pull myself over the courtyard fence, hear Emmy land behind me, then quietly open the courtyard door.\nIt\u2019s quiet inside.\nI wink at Emmy and she jogs down the hallway. We get to the loading construct room and I lie down on the couch and Emmy starts working the controls. The world around me shifts, and I\u2019m standing next to a table, looking at the ghost.\n\u201cI remember you from Welk Island,\u201d it says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I answer, \u201cyou do. Can you stand up?\u201d\nI think I can see the program space around us shimmer for a second; that\u2019s Emmy making a copy. The ghost stands there looking at me, and I\u2019m looking back, and then the construct vanishes. Emmy is smiling.\n\u201cGot it,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nI follow Emmy out of the construct room and down the hall. Close to the courtyard door I collide with someone. It\u2019s a Sinker, and we\u2019re tangled, and he\u2019s holding me, just as surprised as I am.\n\u201cRun,\u201d I say to Emmy, and grab two fistfuls of the man\u2019s shirt. And to the man: \u201cI\u2019m a diver. I was just getting some things I left. No problem. I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nHe\u2019s tense and his eyes are wild. I know if I let go of him he\u2019ll attack, but if I hold him long enough other Mongol Madmen will come. This close to him I smell booze and fear.\nHe shouts.\n\u201cHey! Hey! Hey!\u201d\nHis arm flashes and something digs into my hip. He\u2019s stabbed me, going for the guts, and missed. I thrust with all of my strength, slamming his head against the wall. His arms are everywhere, throwing punches, and I slam his head again, then again, and he collapses. I run and it hurts, and at the corner of the hallway get hit hard from the side. It\u2019s another few Mongol Madmen come running to help their friend, and they\u2019re all over me. We stumble and struggle and I pry myself away and we slam through the courtyard door and now they\u2019re taking places around me, sizing me up, pulling out knives.\nI almost trip on a rock and reach down, lift it, and fling it at the closest Madman. It lands dead center on his viz with a loud pop, whips his head back, and he drops to his knees. The other two pause long enough for me to stumble toward the fence, and then I\u2019m up and over it. The Mongol Madmen scream and I run out into the darkness as fast as I can.\nI make it to the trees, and there\u2019s Emmy, smiling wildly. Laughing. She takes my arm and we run.\nReality, Gently Sharpened is filled with vault divers, shoulder to shoulder on the stairs. They\u2019re passing glasses of whiskey over their heads to each other. It\u2019s quiet.\nI close the door at the very bottom of Reality, and turn to Emmy.\n\u201cReady?\u201d\nShe nods.\nThe ghost is next to her. Outside of the construct space, projected just by the slapped-together diver tech we could find in the bar, the ghost is pale and shaky, and blind without its feedback tech.\nI open the door and the divers get quiet.\n\u201cHere it is,\u201d I say.\nThe ghost steps out.\n\u201cWe found it in a culture vault, on Welk Island. Pretty much the end of the vaults, almost contemporary to the time the ship was launched. It has a vibration in it. An intentional one.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d a voice growls from upstairs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s real. Checked and checked, by her.\u201d I gesture to Emmy.\n\u201cA message?\u201d someone says.\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\nI read the paper that Emmy transcribed the message on: \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re seeing this, you are a researcher of the historical documents included with your colony ship. You likely have questions. It is my intention to provide answers.\u2019\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d\nI nod.\nThe growl again: \u201cSo where the fuck\u2019re the answers?\u201d\n\u201cWelk Island,\u201d I say, \u201cwhere we found him.\u201d\nDead quiet as they realize.\nSome of the clich\u00e9s are true: If you talk to your average citizen of the spirals, someone who lives mid-to-up spiral, where it\u2019s pretty safe and the lights work, they\u2019ll tell you vault divers are a rough crowd. They\u2019re right. We\u2019re risk takers\u2014but not many of us are crazy. Not a single one of these people likes the idea of taking on the Madmen.\n\u201cI know,\u201d I say, and let it hang. \u201cI know The Mongol Madmen have taken over the vault complex and are willing to kill to keep us out. I also know that there\u2019s a ghost with some truth, and that\u2019s what we all signed up for.\n\u201cHer and I are going.\u201d\nI gesture to Emmy, who is standing next to the ghost, looking small. And beautiful: Her viz has fully taken root.\nHer and I are going: This is its own argument, and for the men and women here, I\u2019m hoping it means a lot. They all became divers and analysts for the reasons I did. They knew there was a whole world before, and whole worlds behind the vault doors, and although they could\u2019ve lived a normal life and worked in a shop and drank with shopkeepers at the end of the day, instead they dove.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll kill us,\u201d the man closest to me says.\n\u201cYeah, they might.\u201d\nWe plan the whole thing in Reality, Sharpened. The divers and analysts have been all over the vaults, from ancient times on Origin Earth to the most recent that we know about. If The Mongol Madmen have numbers and savagery, we have knowledge.\nThe next night, up from the vault complex, there\u2019s an uproar. A crowd of vault divers is coming toward it. They\u2019re drunk and loud, and shouting about truth, and breaking into fights with each other. The Mongol Madmen, who are arranged around the front of the vault complex, watch quietly. When the divers get close enough one of The Mongol Madmen gestures and a few of them run forward with buckets and fling liquid in a wide arc, soaking many of the divers. The divers sober up and try to run but already flaming bundles have been chucked after them. A few in the crowd burst into flames and stumble. A few stop to help and they burn too. Vizs flop off of burning bodies.\nFrom the trees on the flank of the vault complex I don\u2019t scream or curse like I want to at what The Mongol Madmen have done but sprint from the trees. Emmy is with me, and a few other divers. We get to the edge of the complex quickly and help each other over the fence.\nThe complex seems empty when we kick the back door in. We move down the hall quickly and get into the construct room. Divers shove heavy furniture in front of the door as others jam at the control board, waking up the link into the vaults.\nI look at Emmy on the couch next to me, and at the divers who stand in front of the blockaded door, and then I lay back.\nWhen I open my eyes we\u2019re on Welk Island, near the water.\nEmmy and I run up the small children\u2019s path that crests the hill, and start out over the grass. She\u2019s panting to keep up, but it\u2019s her mind tricking itself into thinking she\u2019s tired.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not really running, Emmy. You\u2019re on a couch. Slow your breathing down.\u201d\nThe gaze she shoots me is tinged with panic, but she catches up, and her breathing slows down. After just a few minutes we are in town, jogging past the rows of buildings.\nThe cabin we\u2019d found the ghost in had been in the middle of nowhere, but it wasn\u2019t impossible to get to. The people making the vaults back on Origin Earth could\u2019ve put the ghost in a safe a hundred feet under the ground if they\u2019d wanted it never found, but they did want it found\u2014just after some time had passed.\nThe message, though, offered answers. Whatever was going to give us those would probably be in an easy-to-reach place.\nI stop running.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Emmy shouts back to me.\n\u201cHere.\u201d I point at the town\u2019s main tavern. It\u2019s built out of a shipping crate, doors and overhung windows carved out of it.\n\u201cToo obvious. Vault divers and code analysts will have searched it at least fifty times in the last hundred years.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But the person who sent the message wants to be hidden but also obvious. They can\u2019t be found until after we get to the ghost, but once we do, they have a simple little program slaved to the cabin. We take the ghost out of the cabin, and the other program gets freed.\u201d\n\u201cStory time with Irvine.\u201d\n\u201cHumor me.\u201d\nI jog to the tavern and Emmy follows. Inside chairs are arranged in half circles and blankets are piled on the ground. Driftwood branches hang, strung with warm yellow lights. You could forget you\u2019re in a shipping crate.\nThe woman behind the bar turns and smiles.\n\u201cJust who I was looking for,\u201d she says.\nThe rest of the people in the bar are stock-still. The program is frozen.\n\u201cAre you who we are looking for?\u201d\nShe smiles.\n\u201cCome talk.\u201d\nWe sit down at a nearby table.\n\u201cYou research historical documents,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYes. We call ourselves vault divers, looking for traces of the people who created the vaults, to learn more about Earth.\u201d\n\u201cAre you one of the creators?\u201d Emmy says.\n\u201cSomeone like me. I\u2019m here to answer questions. You want answers about where you\u2019re from, and why you\u2019re here, and I suppose other questions also. That is why the ghost was out in that shack, and why I\u2019m here. We wanted you to meet us when you\u2019d grown a bit.\n\u201cThe best way to begin,\u201d she continues, \u201cis like this. You\u2019re a guess.\u201d\n\u201cA guess?\u201d\n\u201cAbout a hundred years before you left, computers linked up and formed thought pools, self-aware AI communities. You might have guessed that; there would be a gap in the historical records on your ship. Where I\u2019m from, on Earth, they call it Nightfall\u2014every computer shut off, all at once, and then the kill bots came for us. It took us years to fight them. Of course, we learned later, it wasn\u2019t their goal to succeed. They always knew that their ability to kill us off in the real world was hampered. They could outthink us, but life had been evolving for millennia to fight for survival. There would be holes in their planning, they knew. Blind spots in their designs. Humanity had been scrabbling, fighting to survive, forever. They could outthink us, but not evolution.\n\u201cSo they worked with evolution. While the war was going on\u2014a distraction that cost two billion lives\u2014the thought pools created vast city-sized laboratories. Birthing centers. The people inside them didn\u2019t know they were in a zoo, involved in the most large-scale breeding program ever created, and neither did their liberators, those who freed them after the war was won. We didn\u2019t know that the machines had written into human DNA a nearly invisible code. A disease.\u201d\nThe bar is gone; so\u2019s Welk Island. Buildings are around us, a crowded, bustling square. Where is it\u2014Italy? The light looks the way that I\u2019ve seen in vaults of Florence: clean, symphonic.\nEveryone in the square drops mid-stride, dead.\n\u201cHow?\u201d Emmy asks.\n\u201cThe virus is diffuse. Tiny fragments of it were hidden in the people that were liberated from the breeding cities. It has thousands of elements, many combinations of which are deadly when combined.\u201d\n\u201cCombined,\u201d I say; I hadn\u2019t expected this. The spirals feel narrower, darker; the bodies around us piled on each other in the sweet light.\n\u201cPeople meet, have children, and pair the viral elements they\u2019re carrying. Those children pair again. In a few generations there is an intact viral weapon in a significant portion of the population. It waits.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo surprise us, to make it harder to study. Then everyone in a city drops dead at just the same moment.\u201d\n\u201cThe virus communicates with itself?\u201d Emmy says.\n\u201cYes. We haven\u2019t figured out how. Perhaps by pheromones.\u201d\n\u201cSeems like an empty victory,\u201d I say. \u201cEveryone dead. The machines still lost.\u201d\n\u201cOur working theory is that they have an ark somewhere. Perhaps it is far beneath the ocean, or in orbit. Machine technology waiting to emerge and blossom when all of us are dead.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Emmy says. \u201cYou\u2019re hoping to break the viral combos by changing the selection pool.\u201d\nShe nods.\n\u201cCorrect. We can\u2019t remove the viral component. It\u2019s diffuse in the brain, impossible to cut out, and even diffuse across populations. But we hope that for it to be successful and create the combinations it is programmed to it must have access to a sizeable pool of people. So our solution was to pack people into ships, a max crew of five hundred, randomly selected from around the globe, and sent off to start new colonies. We started before many people knew just where the virus came from, and we kept it that way. The people loaded onto the ships were taken without consent or knowledge of where they were going.\u201d\n\u201cYou kidnapped five hundred people and shot them into space?\u201d\n\u201cIt had to be random, you see. What if the viral components can control our behavior? What if we fall in love with a certain person because the viral component tells us too\u2014because they\u2019ve got a viral component that matches well with the existing mix in our community, and by falling in love, we cause this?\u201d She gestures at the bodies all around us. \u201cThe virus is exceedingly subtle. Our greatest hope of outlasting it, and ultimately transferring it into the realm of junk DNA, was to maximize the environmental and biological factors at work: to push, you see, the elements as far as they would go. Hopefully beyond its ability to adapt.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t random. You chose the people you put in that ship,\u201d I say.\n\u201cIt was our best option.\u201d\nShe says this smiling sadly, and she\u2019s a program, so that smile could mean that she really is expressing sadness at the idea of people waking up on a ship tearing out of the solar system to drop them into this dark hole, or it could mean that there is no set response for what I\u2019ve said.\nI sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re hoping the virus will peter out over time.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Without a sufficient pool of people it might be unable to achieve its outcomes. It\u2019ll become junk DNA.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that the machines didn\u2019t predict this?\u201d\nShe nods and smiles.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t. We are guessing. The amount of guesses we make maximizes our chance of the right answer.\u201d\nThere is a pause, a data shift.\n\u201cAccording to my records, you were the nine hundredth colony to leave Earth.\u201d\n\u201cHow many people on Earth have died?\u201d\n\u201cLosses have been suffered globally.\u201d\n\u201cHow many?\u201d\nShe smiles sadly again. \u201cIt is hard to say. North America is empty. Europe as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Emmy asks.\n\u201cA launch complex in New Zealand.\u201d\nHer voice changes. It sounds lighter. \u201cThe planet you were sent to had every indication that it could foster life.\u201d\n\u201cIt does foster life,\u201d I say, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at it.\u201d\nThe program, perhaps reading it as a joke, smiles.\n\u201cIs anyone from Earth coming?\u201d I say.\nThe program is still smiling.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\u201cBut probably not,\u201d Emmy says.\nThere\u2019s not so much as a crack in her smile.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably all dead,\u201d Emmy says.\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d\nShe\u2014it, I\u2019m thinking more now\u2014is still smiling that sad smile, that veil over the ugly truth: Origin Earth is dead.\nEmmy and I sit on a bluff overlooking the water. Except for the waves, the program is frozen, as if it is waiting for us to decide how to react.\n\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is all that\u2019s left.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe some survived on Earth. Maybe there\u2019s other colonies.\u201d\n\u201cDid we outlast the virus?\u201d\nEmmy doesn\u2019t answer. What could she say? We don\u2019t know anything about it. Maybe because the original colonists were from all over the Earth the virus won\u2019t be able to construct itself. Maybe it will just take longer.\nI could drop dead at any second, Emmy with me, and every person in the spiral. Watching the cold water below, it\u2019s hard not to think of every breath as a potential end.\nEmmy pats my back.\n\u201cWe burn the vaults,\u201d I say.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThink about what\u2019s out there, Emmy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Spiral, viz, people?\u201d\n\u201cFive hundred people who didn\u2019t choose to leave Earth were on that lander. Not some crew of explorers, just people dropped into a hole. Out there is what we\u2019ve become\u2014still people in a hole, ready to kill each other, just surviving year to year on a frozen rock. What would those people do if they knew that all their dreams about Origin Earth are wrong? What if they realized the colonists didn\u2019t come because they were brave and ambitious, they were just a guess, just the last ones standing after a plague? They\u2019d have less than the nothing they have now. There\u2019d be nothing to live for. All of us would be Mongol Madmen. If we burn the vaults at least we\u2019d be free.\u201d\n\u201cNot knowing something isn\u2019t the same as freedom.\u201d\n\u201cYes it is,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same. And what do you care? You\u2019re not a vault diver for history. Let\u2019s just burn all of the things we romanticized. Origin Earth is already dead. Let\u2019s bury it.\u201d\nEmmy sighs and looks down at the water. It moves back and forth in a faithful approximation of the mournful shift-drag that is an Earthly tide.\n\u201cIrvine, there\u2019s already nothing to live for. The spiral is dark; it always has been. We could die at any moment but it\u2019s always been that way, for everyone, here and even back on Origin Earth. Every moment is luck. I mean, you think you\u2019re so special? We\u2019re all gonna die, none of us know when or how, and all of us\u2014if we find a light in the cave, we don\u2019t blow it out. There\u2019s not much to live for, but we do it anyway, just like all the people who came before us.\u201d\nEmmy stands up. She bounces a handful a pebbles in her hand, then throws one out into the water.\n\u201cA moment is a coin discovered in the sand. A lifetime is buried treasure. Ginz told me that.\u201d\n\u201cNo he didn\u2019t.\u201d\nEmmy laughs.\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d\nEmmy\u2019s water-swollen books take up a whole wall in my house. I complain about it all the time but she doesn\u2019t listen; she knows I read them too. It\u2019s odd that it had never occurred to me to read the books the colonists had strung together when they first arrived. There are a lot: Those five hundred random souls had wanted to write. And what they wrote about was Origin Earth, their cities, the people they left behind. Reading is like being in the vaults except seeing them through the creator\u2019s mind: It\u2019s intimate. Close. And best of all, when one of them is trying to express some vital thought, and they can\u2019t, and their words fail\u2014missing the sunlight of a late winter morning; missing a lover who was waiting at a caf\u00e9 for a person who never showed up because they were on a ship, and later, in a spiral, writing about it\u2014that\u2019s the closest, the most intimate. The failure of words in the face of yearning.\nThe Mongol Madmen keep the vaults closed. Short of attacking again, there\u2019s no way we could tell what they\u2019re doing in there. Maybe they\u2019re looking for clues about Origin Earth, like we did. If they are, it will take a while before they\u2019re good enough to uncover the vibrations in the ghost, or the bartender on Welk Island who knows that the Earth is already dead.\nSo like I said, I read, and so does Emmy. We talk about books.\nOnce in a while we walk down to the lander to strip it of some part we know would fix someone\u2019s roof, or door, or wall, or whatever. Other times we stand in Reality, Sharpened and I nurse a whiskey and Emmy humors my darkness and we name groups: a glower of trees, an elegy of Ginzs, a shamble of landers.\nBut mostly I read. So does Emmy.\nOne day we\u2019ll run out of books, and then here we\u2019ll be, again, in the dark.\nMike Buckley is a widely-published short story writer whose work has appeared in national journals such as The Alaska Quarterly Review, The Southern California Review, and Clarkesworld, Daily Science Fiction, and Escape Pod.

He plunged his hands into the water, but she was not there; he sent the dogs barking over the hills, but they did not come back with her or a trail to her hiding place. No scent lay over the land. Exhausted and uneasy, Fionn and the dogs trudged back to the house. January was not there, either, though he hunted in every room, under tables and inside wardrobes. He only found his wife, curled up in the oven. The dogs lost interest and went to their beds. Fionn sat down on the kitchen linoleum.\nMara lay tucked neatly between the grill and the oven floor. She should have had to snap her neck to fit, and her throat should have been a mess of small bulging bones, but these days she bent at impossible angles, and her feet seemed to have disappeared entirely into the fan in the oven wall. She wore no clothes. It was a businesslike nudity rather than erotic. Charcoal dusted her skin.\n\u201cShe\u2019s disappeared,\u201d Fionn said, to the linoleum, the oven, the snake-like curve of his wife\u2019s neck.\nMara blinked her wide eyes. \u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cJanuary. She\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u201cNot too long ago,\u201d said Mara, \u201cyou were saying the same about me.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019re jealous.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said agreeably. \u201cWho is she? A lost lover?\u201d\nFionn stared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s January,\u201d he said.\nMara laughed. Her hair tumbled out of the oven and onto the floor, so close that Fionn might have reached out and touched it. He knew better. \u201cJanuary was your friend too,\u201d he told her. \u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Tell me a story about her.\u201d\nFionn thought, and found none. Mara had had few friends, but the ones she\u2019d had were close; and Fionn could think of a hundred stories about each, events he had witnessed and ones he had only heard about, so well-worn with age and retellings that they felt whole and solid as fruit in his mouth.\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t real,\u201d Mara said. \u201cI could tell as soon as you said her name.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean, she isn\u2019t real?\u201d\n\u201cWe know these things,\u201d his wife said. She disentangled one hand to tap her forehead with a thin and pearly finger, and then coiled it back into a spring-tight fist, and slipped it away into the depths of the oven. Her we unnerved Fionn, because it was a growing we, one she mentioned more and more, a crowd steadily approaching from behind, ready to throw envious arms around her neck and pull her backwards, away from him.\n\u201cSome people just aren\u2019t real,\u201d Mara said, as if she had sensed a faux pas and wanted to remedy it. \u201cYou can tell by the sound of their names. She is not a real person, or not the kind of person it\u2019s easy to find in reality, at any rate. How long has she been missing?\u201d\n\u201cSince I went out to the water, maybe.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has that been?\u201d\n\u201cAn hour or so.\u201d\nMara nodded thoughtfully, her chin and the crown of her head knocking against the grill, the oven wall. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d she asked.\nFionn thought about January. He could picture her easily, standing at the edge of the river with a yellow scarf in her hair, but he did not know if it was his river, and her smile was distant and unfocused. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI know her face, I feel as though I know her, but I can\u2019t tell you why.\u201d\n\u201cWe can talk about it later,\u201d Mara said. \u201cYou look tired. You were out in the cold. Cook your dinner, Fionn.\u201d\nIn the past year and a half Mara had grown more watchful over him. She ordered him to wear scarves and boots in bad weather, reminded him of meals he would otherwise have forgotten, sent him off to bed at a reasonable hour. She made sure he kept all his appointments and ordered him to visit the doctor for small but persistent illnesses. Why, he had asked her once, laughing, did she care so much? Didn\u2019t she want him to die comfortably of starvation one day, so they could live together forever, pressed to each other\u2019s hearts like baking bread inside an oven? \u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that,\u201d Mara had hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d\nFionn sat beside the oven to eat his dinner, while Mara sang to him, an unrecognisable and tuneless song, but comforting in its own way. The dogs gathered at his feet.\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Mara announced, when he had finished. \u201cI think you ought to look for her. If you know her but don\u2019t know her, if her disappearance is so troubling to you, there must be a reason. There is a purpose behind it.\u201d\n\u201cIs this one of the things you just know?\u201d he asked.\nShe blinked at him, her eyes too big in her thin, flattened face, a strange facsimile of herself. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me that, Fionn.\u201d\nSo he asked, instead, \u201cWill you help me?\u201d\nMara smiled her same sweet smile. \u201cOf course I will. But you won\u2019t be able to look for her here. You know that, don\u2019t you? You\u2019ll have to leave.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said.\nFionn washed the dinner dishes slowly, listening to Mara hum below the rush of water. Soap grew fluttering bubbles and each bubble spelled out January\u2019s name. January, the colour of a sun rising, her voice in his ear, January waiting. \u201cWhere would you look for her, if you were me?\u201d he asked his wife.\nMara manoeuvred her head around to look up at him, a thoughtful owl. \u201cI would examine the clues,\u201d she said. \u201cI would start at the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cElliptical,\u201d he said dryly.\n\u201cBut accurate.\u201d\nFionn bent, kissed the air beside her cheek, and shut the oven door.\nWhen Mara had first returned, when Fionn recovered from the shock and the strange new logic of his wife as a ghost, he found himself prone to odd hungers. Down in the village, putting sliced pan into a basket, the desire for physical sensation would suddenly snatch at him and he would spend the next hour wandering through the shop aisles, touching knobbed avocados, rough soda bread, the silky synthetic feathers on a feather duster, paper napkins, basil leaves, broom handles; leaving a trail of opened packaging behind himself. Day by day, in slow increments, Mara grew stranger. In the beginning, although he could never touch her with his own hands, she had reconciled her shape to the things around her, the oven walls, the floor. Now she was forgetting how to exist in a concrete world. Her hands sank through iron. Her hair floated around her face like breathing seaweed, immune to gravity or the illusion of gravity. Her bones dwindled, she grew tightly coiled like curled ribbon. Fionn wondered what it would be like to touch her spiralling fingers, how her drifting hair would feel; but he did not know and never would, and this knowledge was a recurring illness that left and returned to attack him and left again. Having a ghost wife was like being married to a concept, an abstract noun, something beloved but elusive.\nThat night he dreamed of January, while a storm vaulted the roof to scream against the angles and planes of the house. Dressed in a yellow macintosh and wellingtons, January stood against the backdrop of foreign hills and valleys. Her hair whipped in the wind; small dragons snapped among the tangled ends. She smiled, and didn\u2019t smile. Fionn, who did not seem to exist in this dream at all, saw that a chain around her neck held three small charms: a frowning sun, a sliver of moon, a lidded eye. January held a book in one hand. Her fingers were blackened with soil or ash. Fionn asked a question, and January answered, her answer was in the affirmative, she reached for him. Downstairs, Mara sang wistfully into the echo of the oven.\nThe next morning Fionn left the house and followed the last few traces January had left behind on his land and in the water: a yellow flower, yellow paint splashed on a broken fence, a bird with yellow plumage on its chest. January left her messages in odd places, borrowing from landscape and flora and fauna as she pleased. Fionn followed her trail down to the barren orchard. Rainwater dripped from the apple trees, although the storm had blown over hours ago. The ground was wet and mulchy.\nA small girl in a yellow smock sat in the crook of a tree-branch, looking down at Fionn. Light pressed against her back, hiding her face from him; her feet, dangling down, were bare, and yellow ribbons flapped and tangled from the hem of her dress. One of the dogs barked at her, half-heartedly, and then gave up and trotted away towards the river.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for January,\u201d said Fionn.\nThe girl said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Fionn.\u201d\n\u201cFionn Cogann. It says so on your van.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know where she is?\u201d\nShe shifted, and Fionn saw that a black sun had been painted over her mouth, with triangular rays like the points on a compass, making her look odd and dangerous, poisonous, many-toothed. He stared, fascinated and appalled. \u201cCome up here and talk to me,\u201d she suggested, so he pulled himself up to settle on the upper branches of the apple tree. Closer, the girl looked to be about ten or eleven, and above her fierce black mouth, black freckles had been dotted across her cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019m Swan,\u201d she said.\n\u201cDo you know where January went?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Swan brushed moss and rainwater from her hands. On one palm, Fionn noticed, someone had painted an open eye; on the other, an eye-shaped moon. \u201cShe\u2019s gone altogether, or hidden very well. How do you know her?\u201d\nFionn thought of January, solid and unplaceable. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nThe little girl shrugged. \u201cJanuary can be like that.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know her?\u201d\n\u201cShe is my sister.\u201d When Swan smiled, it stretched the sun out into a mouthful of fangs. \u201cThough she didn\u2019t live with me, not for years. She lived where she pleased.\u201d\n\u201cHow did you know she was missing?\u201d\n\u201cThe same way you did.\u201d\nAt one end of the world, the villagers worked and conversed, brought children to school, studied, cooked; at the other end, Mara lay in Fionn\u2019s oven like a snail curled up in its own shell; but this was somewhere in between the two, a dim twilight place, utterly inexplicable. \u201cHas she done this before?\u201d Fionn asked, half hopelessly. \u201cDisappeared without warning?\u201d\n\u201cHundreds of times,\u201d said Swan. \u201cBut never like this. This time is different, and I know it, and you know it.\u201d\nThey stared at one another. Swan\u2019s pockets, Fionn saw, were full of cut flowers, daisies, buttercups, children\u2019s flowers, but none of them was wilting; they stood up tall and elegant, as though sipping water from some hidden source. Fionn sighed. \u201cHave you been sitting here waiting for me?\u201d he asked Swan.\n\u201cI have been waiting for someone. I assumed it was you.\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d she said, \u201cthree. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d he asked her.\n\u201cI am,\u201d said Swan.\nFionn led her back to the house. Swan paused to examine the shoes lined up in the hallway, the umbrellas toppled over beside the coat-rack, the photographs on the wall - Fionn and Mara\u2019s wedding, Fionn and Mara in black and white, reduced to only the light and the darknesses of themselves - and the big gilt mirror, in which Swan\u2019s face floated small and pale as a ghostly fish. Fionn left her studying her own reflection and went into the kitchen to make breakfast. He did not open the oven, not wanting Swan to know about his dead wife, not wanting to share Mara with her, but it was the first thing Swan did when she wandered in from the hall; she sat cross-legged on the linoleum and tugged at the oven door. Mara blinked at Swan.\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Swan asked.\n\u201cI might ask you the same question,\u201d Mara said. \u201cThis is my house.\u201d\nSwan hooked one arm around her grass-stained knees. \u201cYou\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cMy sister might be dead,\u201d she offered, a conciliatory gesture.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d said Mara.\nFionn made tea and bacon sandwiches, and he and Swan ate on the floor while Mara nibbled delicately at a piece of burnt onion. Swan ate two sandwiches, and then finished Fionn\u2019s, and hunted through his refrigerator for lunch meats and cold leftover potatoes. \u201cWhere did you live, if not with January?\u201d Fionn asked her, when she had exhausted his food supply and sat arranging frozen raspberries into indecipherable, bleeding designs on the linoleum.\n\u201cIrrelevant, Fionn,\u201d said Swan, and she sounded calm and self-assured as any adult.\n\u201cDo you have any other brothers or sisters?\u201d\nSwan stood without answering, wiped raspberry juice onto her yellow dress, and left the kitchen. Mara shooed Fionn away with both hands, and after a moment he followed the little girl into the living room. Swan held up a picture of Fionn as a child. It was a bad photograph, but one he loved, because it was the only picture he had left of his mother: she stood behind him, pale and indistinct, her long hair blown across her face; and Fionn sat in a patch of dusky grass, playing with finger paints. Three black fingerprint dots crossed his cheek. His mouth was a dark and painty smudge.\n\u201cFionn,\u201d Swan said, her voice low, urgent. \u201cThere is somewhere we have to go.\u201d\nViolins had woken Swan that morning, shrilling against the chime of a grandfather clock. She knew her sister was missing. Scented air blew across the tops of green bottles, blue bottles, clear bottles scattered across the room, and the breathy notes sang in harmony, and they sang Swan, Swan, Swan.\nShe crawled out of her bed when the strings woke her. Swan lived, and had lived for the past three years, in an old brewery: a place still summery with the smell of hops, where nameless machines rusted and broken glass caught every angle of light on the floor and in the windows. She walked barefoot across the factory.\nThe first owners of the brewery lived there still. They were old, a few hundred years old, so long dead that they had forgotten even how to be ghosts, and only remembered their roots in the roots clinging to the earth. Once, Swan expected, they had carried shapes and voices; these remnants drifted away piece by piece, and now they were nothing but air and misplaced colours in light. They cared for her like loving parents. They had little to say, but listened sympathetically to her stories, and made her tea full of tin buttons and dust. They had met January only once.\nSwan climbed up into an empty window-frame and looked out over the canal and boardwalk. January was nowhere to be seen, not in the waterfront businesses, the tall apartments, the crumbling lacework of bridge. Swan was used to disappearances. Her family was a family of strangers. But not January, not in this dreadful manner, an absence like a body carved in two. Something terrible had happened.\nJanuary had been young once, too. She had lived with Swan in a city apartment. They had slept side-by-side in a king-sized bed, and their walls were decorated with strings of seashells, sugary sea glass, dried flowers. January baked mussels for their supper in smoky sacrificial fires. Her younger face was different from the one she wore later, as an adult: swirled with black designs, her lips plum-red, vicious red, golden hoops swinging in her ears. Her older face was more sedate, more cosmopolitan, but Swan remembered the days when January climbed trees for the choicest apples and screamed to the wind. January had been Swan\u2019s protector, and neither men nor monsters ever troubled them. But when Swan turned eight January packed away her lacy dresses, her willow spears, her golden earrings, put on a face more suitable for the outside world, and walked away. Swan had not cried. Without January to be the strong one, Swan was no longer the weak one, which meant she had grown strong, which meant she would never be afraid again. She left her own home and wandered up and down the city until she found the abandoned brewery.\nNow, sensing her worry, the brewery owners surrounded Swan with their sweet breath. One made her a cup of tea. One brought a mouldy biscuit. Swan swallowed a piece of broken glass, an apple seed, a dead moth. \u201cJanuary is missing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you think I should do? Do you think I should look for her?\u201d\nAutomatically, the shapeless shapes of the brewery owners shook their gusty heads. No, no, no, they breathed.\nJanuary had visited Swan in the brewery once, almost a year before. She appeared in the factory front, wearing a belted yellow raincoat and fingerless lace gloves, bearing gifts like a conquering hero. She gave Swan expensive dresses, suede boots, sun hats with hanging veils of silk, wheels of cheese and salted meats, strings of glossy beads, elderflower cordial in frosted bottles, a silver tea service, pearl-drop earrings, a new yellow jacket. Swan accepted these gifts wordlessly. Rain dripped from January\u2019s coat, though outside the sun shone. Her hair clung damply around her neck. Troubled, the brewery owners stood at Swan\u2019s back, swirling themselves into a mistrustful light show. January had not noticed. Her adult face, clear of black paint, was swept with blush, her eyes dark and fluttering lashes long as spider legs. She spoke in a strange new dialect. January stayed for one night; in the morning she kissed Swan\u2019s cheek, and left.\nSwan ignored the advice of the brewery owners. They begged her to stay, to lie in the sunny factory and doze and dream and let them blow music from the many warped bright bottles. Instead, she dressed and she tied up her long hair. She pressed her mouth to the glassy ground. January\u2019s scent hung there, faintly. Swan left the brewery owners to their own dreams.\nEvery step Fionn took away from Mara was a tangible one, a chain around his feet. He sat in a silver taxi and watched mile after mile of distance separate them. This world, the world into which he shot like a reluctant bullet, seemed to be the ghostly one, barely readable outside the car window; while his house and his dead wife were solid, a known territory. If Mara had taken up residence in his skull instead of his oven none of this would matter. There would be no room for imaginary January then, only the two of them, husband and wife, husband and ghost, the most intimate marriage.\nThey left the taxi at a hill lined with tall Georgian houses. Up on a black cliff, a castle made of golden rock balanced like a bird perching over the city. A tourist attraction, an historical remnant. Fionn wondered about the castle\u2019s ovens. Where were they? Did someone keep them working? Did other ghosts live in them, royal ghosts, passing their time with songs and counting games, waiting until the castle crumbled around them? If the world\u2019s ovens were populated with ghosts, how did anyone ever get any cooking done? A mystery, Fionn thought, one not even Mara would answer.\nHe and Swan counted houses until they came to seventy-six, a number that pleased them both, and they stopped simultaneously, and nodded at one another. Fionn opened the door. Inside the house smelled of cooking rice, limes, and another sweet, unnameable fruit. Along the seashell-grey walls, someone had hung old black-and-white photographs, minimalist things: a table full of light, a hat stand with one black hat, an empty bridge; stenographer\u2019s shorthand for a life history. Swan smashed one frame against the wall and picked the photo out from the shards of glass. On the back was written O\u00f9 es-tu? The picture showed a path of white stones, leading from nowhere to nowhere. Fionn and Swan made their way slowly down the length of the corridor, smashing every glass frame, examining every smooth, age-worn photograph. Each one had a note for them to read. Put together, they made up a strange news story, one without statistics or irrefutable evidence, and too arcane to be useful. Fionn and Swan collected the photographs in their pockets and stepped into the first room they found.\nIt was a bedroom, January\u2019s. Dusty teacups arranged like standing stones waited on the floor to trip them up. The bedclothes on the iron-barred bed were rumpled; Swan found a single piece of orange peel beneath the pillow, a clue that left them with more questions than answers. On the ceiling above them, black mould blossomed in the shape of a woman\u2019s frowning, indistinct face, a reproachful guardian angel. Fionn stared across the room at the bathroom door. He knew it was the bathroom door; and he knew that he should not cross the room to see it, knew that if he tried the floor would buck and tilt like a rough ocean, the armchair would snap ferocious teeth at him and the wardrobe would yawn to swallow him whole. He moved towards it. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Swan whispered.\nIn the bathroom, mirrors glinted everywhere. They were sulky creatures and refused to show Fionn his own pale face. Coloured water had fallen on the floor, and he side-stepped it carefully. January\u2019s bathtub was a wide one, knobbed jets and painted tiles, surrounded by vials of bath salts, perfumed soap, tiny bottles of essential oils. In the bathtub lay January. Her hair was tangled and matted. Blood had dried into a dull glint. January wore veined, blue-tinted skin, and her eyes were open, cloudy like lake-water in a glass.\n\u201cYou knew, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Fionn said.\nHe crept closer. January\u2019s chest lay open like a tree, and inside it was a white staircase crowded with ivy, leading down, and warm air, the sounds of birds calling somewhere in the distance. Swan, hovering beside Fionn, rested her face on his arm.\n\u201cWhat are the rules,\u201d he asked, \u201cin a situation like this? Are we here to sew her up? To bury her and forget her?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Swan.\nIf January was dead, they were all dead, Fionn and Swan as well as Mara coiling in her oven, January neat and ajar. It seemed an impossible situation. Fionn gazed, pensive, at his lack of a reflection. In the end, he offered his hand to Swan, and she took it, the half-moon on her palm smiling into his skin; together, they stepped into the bathtub. He lifted Swan onto the first white step, and then swung himself down onto the open path in January\u2019s chest. Fionn and his sister started down the stairs.\nSomewhere, bread was baking. Mara smelled it and rose, uncoiling the way a snake rises, charmed, from its basket. She had not been a baker. She did not know pound cakes from fairy cakes; but these days the smell of bread welcomed her. She extended her pointed toes delicately. Each step was another oven, a shoe for her feet, until she found the bread in a stranger\u2019s kitchen, and wrapped herself around it like a nesting doll. Behind her, darkness stretched out, never-ending; in front of her, Fionn wandered through the world; they were choices, ones she could not deny, only delay; and ovens seemed to speak her language. This one was vast, sweet-scented. A chef\u2019s home. A bakery. Mara nibbled experimentally at a piece of char on the oven floor.\nA small wind blew a puff of flour in Mara\u2019s eyes, with the scent of seaweed and roses. January had tossed her yellow hair. \u201cGreetings,\u201d she said. Mara could not place the accent, but it did not matter. It was unmistakably January, impossibly January. Who else would it be?\n\u201cDoes this mean you\u2019re dead?\u201d Mara asked. \u201cMy husband is off looking for you. He is a wonderful man, a lovely man. If he dies in your pursuit I will be furious with you.\u201d\nJanuary shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m dead.\u201d\n\u201cI know you are,\u201d January said, and laughed her beautiful laugh. \u201cBut for people like me, like my sister, like your husband, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as simple as that. There are not only two states of being, alive and dead. There are others.\u201d\nMara ground burnt bread between her teeth. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d\nThey sat in silence for a moment. Mara thought of Fionn, the way she always thought of Fionn. If he died, who would hunt for him? Who would cross the country in search of his body, whether alive, or dead, or some mysterious third option? She asked, \u201cWhat part of you is here, if you don\u2019t know where you are?\u201d\n\u201cThe smallest part,\u201d said January.\nI will hunt for him, Mara thought; and it was a realisation, and a choice.\nJanuary drew herself closer, as though seeking heat in the heat of the oven. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what happened to me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you believe in ghost stories?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mara said, judiciously. \u201cDo you believe that they can help you?\u201d\nThe baking bread glowed like a fire signal.\nBecca De La Rosa lives in Dublin, Ireland, where she is studying Ancient Greek at university.

Boxy, as my kids dubbed it, while reassuring, is a single-minded cyborg enhancement. When it was first discussed, I had asked the doctors to include a USB port and headphone jack, but apparently my mods were being installed by people who had medical ethics. When I mentioned this to the tech who ran the post-op diagnostics, she laughed and told me the device had a built-in speaker. Despite the intense pain, I chuckled, thinking she was playing along. A second later, beeping noises began to emanate from within my chest.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the warning tone. If you hear that, call us immediately.\u201d\nBoxy apparently has more than one tone that they didn\u2019t tell me about. A few weeks after surgery, I discovered the tone used to inform me that I\u2019m too close to a magnetic field, placing both of us at risk. Then, at my most recent diagnostic session, they warned me about another alarm that will activate soon. Apparently, I\u2019m about to face the classic cyborg low-battery problem. Any day now, it could start blasting a British police siren sound for one minute at 9AM EST every day until I return to the factory/hospital. There\u2019s still plenty of charge, should I need it, but they don\u2019t want to take any chances. I can appreciate that and I suppose I really should look out for Boxy as much as they have looked out for me.\nStill, I can\u2019t help but look at this technology and feel like they could make some improvements when it comes to the tones. Boxy should be capable of something more. I can almost hear my doctors talking now, \u201cOh no, the science fiction guy is back.\u201d If you want to annoy me into going back to the hospital for a battery replacement why stop at an alarm? I\u2019d probably just smack my chest looking for the snooze button. Why not raise my incentive by giving Boxy an annoying personality and voice? Have them taunt me with bad puns and jokes about their impending demise and diminishing reserves. Every day, make the situation more desperate and dire. Pleading, if it becomes necessary. If I go near a magnetic field, have it complain to me sarcastically about how stupid I was to do so and if I don\u2019t listen, escalate it to painful screams. If I don\u2019t back away, I\u2019m sure those around me will see to it that I do.\nUltimately, I know this is just the story-oriented part of my brain trying to distract me from the impending battery-replacement surgery. It\u2019s routine surgery done on a daily basis, but this time it\u2019s me on the table and I\u2019m bad enough having my blood drawn. I know I\u2019m living a tiny bit of a science fictional life as a cyborg, so it\u2019s only natural that my brain would drift towards an even more fictional approach. It\u2019s probably not the weirdest defense mechanism my doctors will have encountered. Maybe I\u2019ll have them tell me some stories.\nFor now, however, I will continue the daily vigil, waiting for Boxy to tell me: \u201cCall the hospital. It\u2019s time.\u201d\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

My last two editorials have been on the heavier side of things, exposing some sad truths about short fiction reviews and short fiction magazines. They\u2019ve generated a fair bit of discussion and I hope it continues to do so. As expected, there were some who tried to twist my words to fit their own narrative or self-promote. The people that amused me most were those who tried to paint me as an old guard traditionalist. Admittedly, Clarkesworld being nine years old makes us positively ancient in internet years, but we\u2019ve never given up on trying new things, even the \u201ccrazy\u201d ones. If that\u2019s become old guard, I was right to be concerned about the future of a field I love.\nIt\u2019s easy to become distracted by the stray voices of discord on the internet. Most of the feedback from these two editorials was quite positive. Several people echoed my sentiments about supporting the publications you love before they need to be saved and some even mentioned that they had been inspired to do so. That\u2019s uplifting, but what I\u2019ve seen doesn\u2019t change those darker predictions for a market compression. The numbers simply don\u2019t line up with the volume of publications. In the end, it\u2019s readership that determines the size of the pool.\nThat said, I can think of no better time than Thanksgiving\u2014this month in the U.S.\u2014to say thank you for being one of our readers. You mean the world to us. I hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019ve put more of you on my holiday wish list.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

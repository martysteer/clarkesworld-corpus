In preparation, the savvy moderator sent us a list of possible questions to review, so that we could highlight the ones we were most interested to answer.\n Among the list, was a leading question about \u201cKilling your darlings.\u201d I wrote a big NO beside this question, not because I didn\u2019t want to answer it, but because my version of Killing Darlings is different enough that it might take the entire hour to explain. Or very conveniently, the exact length of this essay.\n Most take Killing Darlings literally, as in the George R. R. Martin sense of the phrase. Create a character, fall in love with them so much that they almost become the star of the story, make the reader fall in love with them, and then sacrifice them to the god of fiction before the end of the book.\n To me, the meaning is a bit subtler. \u201cDarlings\u201d can be anything you love, or you think you love. When I reflect back on all the things I\u2019ve watched die in my career\u2014characters, plotlines, titles, friends, family, lovers, my na\u00efve perceptions of the industry, books I\u2019ve never published and books I have\u2014I realize I\u2019ve become quite the undertaker. At the very least, it certainly alters one\u2019s perceptions.\n The first Darlings I had to learn how to kiss goodbye were my titles. The Telaphab from Z-A became AlphaOops: The Day Z Went First in two shakes of a lamb\u2019s tail, and I had no say in the matter. \u201cTelaphab\u201d is the word \u201calphabet\u201d with all the letters mixed up, which is exactly what my story was about. But it was too clever, they said. No one would figure that out, they said. \u201cAlphaOops is great!\u201d they said.\n They were probably right. In the last twelve years I\u2019ve seen and heard just about every version of this title, including \u201cAlphaOpps,\u201d \u201cAlphabetOops\u201d and \u201cAlphaPoops.\u201d The Telaphab would have flown right over people\u2019s heads. And yet, I\u2019m still kind of bitter about it.\n Sherrilyn Kenyon told me to start saving my book files under the name of the main character. \u201cSunday\u201d was easy, because that\u2019s what the short story was called. When the novelization of that story was bought, the publisher didn\u2019t care what the short story was called. They liked Enchanted. Didn\u2019t care if it was the name of a Disney move and a Taylor Swift song. I gave in . . . while also coming up with titles for the other six books in the series.\n I asked if Beloved would be okay for book three, despite the fact that it\u2019s a Toni Morisson title. \u201cSure,\u201d they said. \u201cIt fits with the nursery rhyme. Your book is so different, no one would ever confuse the two.\u201d\n A few weeks before the preorder launch, I got an email saying I had just twenty four hours to come up with another title. (Because Beloved is the title of a famous Toni Morrison book, dontcha know.) After a solid day of researching through the dictionary, thesaurus, and the collected works of Shakespeare, I submitted a list of titles. Dearest was last on the list, tossed on right as I wrote the email. I didn\u2019t even like it.\n So, of course, that\u2019s the one they picked.\n Whenever I hear a fledgling author tell me that they have the perfect title for their book, I say, \u201cOh, honey,\u201d in that very southern \u201cbless your heart\u201d sort of way. I can almost see the Executioner of Darlings, sharpening his ax.\n I have to say though, the toughest ones are the Darlings that die on your hard drive, withering on the vine. These are the ideas that never leave the notebook. The outlines that no one loved enough. The stories that still yearn to be books, or comics, or television series, but only make enough money for coffee and a donut.\n An aspiring writer in one of my groups recently asked about an idea that was becoming too big for his short story. It needed to be a novel, he said, so he considered scrapping the short story and tucking in for the long haul.\n As a veteran of the publishing industry, I will tell you that this is 100% the wrong thing to do.\n Write submittable material when you can\u2014especially when you\u2019re just starting out. Finish it (finishing something is one of the toughest learning curves, so you may as well work on it now) and submit it (getting used to rejection is another hurdle) and keep moving forward (momentum: a thing with which you will never stop struggling).\n \u201cSunday,\u201d as mentioned above, was my very first professional short story sale. While I was mulling over the plot and before I had even written a word, I had a moment that I still remember to this day. I was in the car on my way to Charleston to visit my little sister, and my brain stumbled across the most magical, amazing subplot about Aunt Joy and the nameday gifts she had given all the Woodcutter children.\n I also knew, deep down in my heart, that this particular bit of information would completely derail my already dense storyline.\n I made myself a promise in that moment: I would write the short story now, to hit the deadline for the Codex Writers contest, but I would ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT A DOUBT go back and write the novel version of the story that the world needed hear.\n That story became Enchanted, my first published novel. It released in May of 2012, six years after \u201cSunday\u201d was published as the centerfold title in Realms of Fantasy. And while it took me two days to write that story, it took me five years to finish the novel.\n That one was a success, but there are so many others that died on the vine. \u201cGrim Repo,\u201d still dreams of becoming a graphic novel series someday. I saw \u201cSanta CIS Episode One: No Saint\u201d as a potential holiday TV miniseries. Fortunately, that last idea was lucky enough to make it into the Upside Down anthology.\n My proofreaders were all mad that \u201cThe Goblin and the Treasure\u201d from Once Upon a Quest wasn\u2019t already a novel. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to write a goblin novel with all my heart (featuring large worldbuilding chunks that I already possess, left on the cutting room floor of When Tinker Met Bell), it\u2019s that I just don\u2019t have the time right now to pen an 80,000-word novel just for funsies.\n I\u2019ve got several freelance articles and reviews to finish (including this one), a picture book pitch to rewrite for a major publisher, a grant proposal to polish up and submit, three audios to finish recording and/or promoting, a fairy tale rant script to polish up for my Sideshow at DragonCon, and the rest of a to-do list before I can even think of tackling the 45 book ideas I wish I was working on right this second.\n Oh, my dearest Darlings. But I can\u2019t think about them, lest their neglect overwhelm and derail me.\n As a pro writer, you have to go where the money is first. After you write the \u201cpocket projects,\u201d as Jane Yolen calls them (to put money in your pocket), then you get to write the stories for your heart. This is one of the biggest daily struggles I face. Those Darlings haunt me, constantly.\n Lately I have made a deal with myself: I have broken my to-do list out into several categories (don\u2019t judge). I have:\n 1.) Tasks I Can Accomplish In a Short Amount of Time\n 2.) Tasks That Take Longer (but Still Need To Be Done)\n 3.) Follow-Up, and\n 4.) Projects of the Heart.\n As long as I can accomplish one of the items from the first two lists (I think of this as my \u201coffice hours\u201d) while keeping an eye on the third, then I am free to do whatever I want with regards to the last. Maybe it will be work on that contemporary romance novel, or this essay collection, or that memoir, or that YA novel I always wish I\u2019d been able to finish.\n I am aware that if I picked one project and stuck to it, I\u2019d probably have all of these finished, eventually. But I know that\u2019s not the way I work. As long as I keep fiddling with them, who\u2019s to say that they won\u2019t all be set loose into the world at some point anyway?\n And all the rest of those ideas and short stories wishing they were picture books and novels\u2014they will continue to languish on my hard drive, dying slow, lingering deaths as they patiently wait their turn.\n Poor Darlings.\n Alethea Kontis is a princess, author, fairy godmother, and geek.

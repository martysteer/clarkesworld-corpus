I was initially concerned that without the required social interactions of my old job that I might over-embrace my hermit tendencies, but a recent flurry of invitations to various genre events and conferences has keep me out-and-about. Turns out that this is a double-edged sword for me. I enjoy getting out amongst fans and writers, but being social is exhausting. By the time I return home, I need several days to recover. That usually involves sleep and hiding in our house.\n May is typically a recovery month for me and one of the few times that recharge cycle happens outside our house. Every year, before the rates go up and the place gets crowded, we pack up the car and take the kids to Ocean City, NJ. We seem to have a knack for picking the most rainy weekend in May, but that doesn\u2019t deter us. At this point, I\u2019m not sure what we would do if rain didn\u2019t force us to stay in the room at least one day. These cold, wet family trips to the beach have become my favorite thing we do as a family and the only trip I hate to come home from.\n This year fit the tradition. Rain, more rain, heavy rain, and then a bit of sun. Rain or shine, we walked the boardwalk and on most days, bought a Polish Water Ice. We\u2019ve been doing this long enough now that the woman who runs that shop recognizes us from year-to-year\u2014something I find astonishing. As a kid, my family was always going somewhere different. I never imagined that I would want to vacation in the same place from year-to-year, but I can\u2019t imagine giving this up. Most years, I need this. This year, I think I underestimated just how much I needed it.\n Back at one hundred percent, I had a few days before I had to be \u201con\u201d again. Later that week, I drove five-and-a-half hours to Pittsburgh for the Nebula Awards Conference. One of the other things I do is edit the SFWA Bulletin, so I was there to cover the event and help out where I could. I was also there to cheer on Sam J. Miller, whose story \u201cThings With Beards\u201d was up for a Nebula. Interesting side note: I bought that story at the Nebulas the year before, and another the year before that. Continuing that tradition, Sam\u2019s story in this month\u2019s issue was acquired there this year. I seldom get to accept stories in-person, so this is a novelty for me. Sam didn\u2019t win, but while we were there, it was announced that his story\u2014and \u201cTouring with the Alien\u201d by Carolyn Ives Gilman\u2014were finalists for the Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award. Congrats to both of them, once again!\n Patreon was unable to get someone to the Nebulas this year, so I was asked to step in and run a half-hour panel for them. Cat Rambo and Merc Rustad joined me and we shared our collective experiences. As expected, thirty minutes wasn\u2019t nearly enough to cover what we would have liked to, but it was good enough to provide an introduction and starting point for the audience. Afterwards, I posted a list of genre authors on Patreon and a quick list of some of our recommendations. If you\u2019ve considered launching your own page, you might want to check it out at neil-clarke.com/nebula-awards-weekend-patreon-panel/.\n One of the other highlights of the weekend for me was chatting with Don L. Jones, the artist responsible for creating the amazing assortment of robot centerpieces at the Nebula Awards ceremony. It\u2019s no secret that I\u2019m a huge fan of robots\u2014just look to this month\u2019s cover for another example\u2014so it was a pleasure chatting with a fellow B9 fan and to learn about his artistic process. Check out his website at www.jonesrobo-works.com and you\u2019ll see just why one of these little guys had to come home with me.\n Accompanied by my robot and one of his friends\u2014a robot that I\u2019ll eventually accompany into New York City so he can reach his final destination\u2014I drove the five-and-a-half hours back home and I\u2019ve been hiding out here ever since. I\u2019m back out on the road\u2014Cascade Writers Workshop and the Locus Awards\u2014towards the end of the month and then out to Readercon in July, but that\u2019s it for the summer. Sadly, no Worldcon for me this year. My budget simply won\u2019t permit it.\n It does mean that I\u2019ll finally get a full month at home though!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

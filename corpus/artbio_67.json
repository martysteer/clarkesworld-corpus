I have been an artist for as long as I can remember. I believe we all start out as artists, and I have no doubt that at some point, each of us has picked up a pencil or marker to connect with our creative side. I just decided to stick with it and have stayed committed to developing my style which consists of a wide range of realism, abstract and a little bit of both. In short, I paint what I like and choose colors that move me. My subject matter is also wide ranging, consisting of concept, whimsical, wildlife, fantasy and science fiction. I work with acrylic, oils, digital and follow a simple rule: I make my traditional paintings look like digital photos and my digital work like traditional paintings. I believe art is more than just a piece of paper or canvas; it is an extension of the artist himself. For me, my goal is to produce art worthy of being displayed in people's homes, featured on magazine covers, a catalyst to inspire our youth, and to leave a legacy for my family. Time escapes us all, thus, I choose to spend my time being a loving husband, chasing my dreams and developing my craft."}

The first two volumes went by the name Realms 1 and 2, but since then they\u2019ve carried the Clarkesworld name. The print editions look great on your bookshelf, but the ebook editions are good too.\nOur latest volume, Clarkesworld: Year Five, was released just before the holidays. (Yes, we are a bit behind, but have been making a valiant effort to get caught up.) At present, Year Six is scheduled for the end of the first quarter and Year Seven is on-track for release at Readercon in July.\nWorking on these volumes has been a fun look back at some of the amazing stories our authors have written for us over the years. I hope you all consider purchasing one or more. Every penny made from these volumes goes back into our fiction budget.\nHave you heard of Patreon?\nPatreon is best described as a cross between Kickstarter and subscriptions. Instead of focusing on a big project, like a book or a movie, Patreon is for people who produce recurring content, like podcasts, YouTube channels, web comics, or a magazine. Patrons make pledges to give a monthly amount for each month that new content is released. Similar to Kickstarter, there are community giving goals and individual rewards for your support.\nTo make ends meet, we sell our books and electronic subscriptions, but over the years, people have repeatedly asked for other alternatives to support us financially. To that end, we\u2019ve established a Patreon page and just like our promise to increase the number of stories we publish when we hit a specific subscriber count, we\u2019ve added a similar goal to our Patreon page. We could have two additional stories per issue if both of these goals are met and as I mentioned previously, it would only take a small percentage of our readers/listeners to get us there.\nJanuary means it\u2019s time for our annual Clarkesworld Reader\u2019s Poll. Each year, we ask our readers to pick their favorite cover art and original stories from the past year.

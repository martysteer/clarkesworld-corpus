Ancient volcanoes had been re-plumbed and reinvigorated, helping maintain a deep warm sweetly-scented atmosphere. This was a tourist destination famous for its open-air cities, for flying naked, and for the billion human-stock citizens leading fascinating lives. And best of all, this Mars was a paradise within an arm\u2019s lazy reach, and always free.\nKleave didn\u2019t know much about the real Red Planet. Just that it was cold and dead on the outside, but infested with bugs underground. Only the Unified Space Agencies had access, and they sent nothing up there but sterile robots. But as a public service, Agency researchers built a faithful model of what was real, using off-the-shelf AIs and a fraction of their annual budget to build a virtual seed planted inside servers somewhere in the depths of the Atlantic. Ten thousand years of inspired terraforming were crossed in a week, and the results were opened for everyone to enjoy: A public playground and an advertisement for scientific inquiry, as well as one of the densest simulations in existence. Only the Disney-Burroughs Mars was as sophisticated, and that park was far too expensive for a man living on investments and a public stipend. Kleave had visited the D-B just once, and that adventure was still being paid off a little more every month.\nThe public Mars had a famously lovely coastline. Lying inside his in nubibus, Kleave felt as if he was facing the warm surf while lying naked on hot butterscotch-colored sand. Full of peppered shrimp and a vodka Collins, the young man was happy and ignorant. There was absolutely no inkling of disaster. Doobie was in charge of the lunch menu, and his long-term partner had just stepped out of her in nubibus, needing to pee and check on the oatmeal cookies. And that happened to be when a mature jelly-island decided to breach on the horizon. Always interesting, the creature began to spit flares while it inflated and deflated its gigantic body, proving its magnificence while driving waves at the red shoreline below. That was a scene worth watching. But then a pair of native humans approached. Tall, tall people with albatross wings growing from those broad Martians\u2019 backs, they were a gorgeous couple singing with opera voices. Something intriguing was sure to happen. Should he call Doobie back from the apartment? No, Kleave just stared with shameless, re-woven eyes. Every pixel was supposed to be committed to memory. In a world of easy tricks, this was about the easiest. Kleave watched the girl catch her boy in midair, her body curling around his and then pulling both of them into the impossibly warm surf. A romantic embrace ended with the Martians emerging, laughing as they shook those white feathers dry, and then the lad began to chase the girl, first with long, graceful strides, and then both in the air again, musical giggles merging with the soughing of slow magnificent waves.\nThe lovers vanished and the jelly-island submerged again, but then the promised cookies arrived, warm and moist, familiar hands slipping them inside Kleave\u2019s in nubibus.\nDoobie appeared beside him, spectacularly naked. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d\n\u201cQuite a lot,\u201d he promised.\nYet the world\u2019s simplest trick refused to cooperate. Kleave first tried to summon the strangers coupling in the water, then tried to bring back the giant cnidaria quivering under the silvery-blue air. Yet neither memory file seemed to exist.\n\u201cWhat are you doing wrong?\u201d\nThat was Doobie\u2019s first reaction.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing nothing wrong,\u201d said Kleave. Then he failed to summon up half a dozen random events. The terror grew until his heart pounded, and that\u2019s when Kleave finally tried to bring back the evening when he first took this glorious woman to bed. An event which he remembered very well on his own. But even that eternal file was gone.\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d Doobie said.\nKleave wanted to agree with her.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done something wrong,\u201d she kept insisting.\nWhich implied that he could do something right and fix this.\n\u201cFix it,\u201d she said.\nThat\u2019s what Kleave intended to do, for sure. But where to begin? Eleven years of a thoroughly recorded life had been lost, and the beautiful, disagreeable woman beside him seemed like a stranger.\n\u201cThree archives,\u201d said the wizard. \u201cThat\u2019s the common standard.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\u201cTwo technologies, two languages.\u201d\n\u201cYes, and yes.\u201d\n\u201cWith one archive kept off-site.\u201d\nKleave couldn\u2019t remember where that \u201con-site\u201d storage was, but he was confident about his \u201coff-site\u201d archive. \u201cI\u2019ve got a second null-drive at my sister\u2019s apartment.\u201d\n\u201cAnd your sister lives underground?\u201d\n\u201cSure. In an abandoned gold mine, sure.\u201d\nThe wizard stared at him, humorless as stone.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m kidding,\u201d Kleave said. \u201cBut the drive is sitting safe inside a lockbox, and I should be able to access it now. Right?\u201d\nScorn filled that older face. Was this was a real man running diffusion software, talking to multiple clients, or a single AI designed to make unfortunate souls feel even more miserable than they already were?\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Kleave said.\n\u201cWhat? That idiots deserve their fates?\u201d\nOnly humans could be that dickish. \u201cYeah, well. Just try and help me figure out my fate. Would you please?\u201d\nA shiny probe appeared. Kleave\u2019s face was interesting, then his neck. The hunt ended with a spot behind the right ear.\n\u201cNow I remember,\u201d Kleave said. \u201cIt was implanted in college, when I upgraded from . . . what? Did I have an Intel archive before this?\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell would I know?\u201d\nYeah. Definitely a human male.\n\u201cOkay, I see the problem,\u201d the wizard said. \u201cJudging by the damage, it looks like a fat daughter hit you.\u201d\n\u201cFat daughter?\u201d\n\u201cBorn from an ultra-high-energy mother particle. That big gal struck the upper atmosphere, triggering a rain of particles. I\u2019m guessing your sister lives nearby.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long walk.\u201d\n\u201cOf course those daughters aren\u2019t as energetic as the original. But one of them definitely found you inside your apartment, and in the same thousandth of a second, one of her sisters struck your precious lockbox too.\u201d\n\u201cGod, that sounds so unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cDisasters are always unlikely. That\u2019s why nobody seems ready for them.\u201d\nExcept \u201cdisasters\u201d were other people\u2019s problems. This was a catastrophe. Struggling for hope, Kleave said, \u201cMaybe something else went wrong.\u201d\nThe wizard didn\u2019t call him, \u201cIdiot.\u201d Except with those narrowed eyes and that smug, silent mouth. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a thought. But null-drives are extraordinarily reliable, and a \u2018failure\u2019 signal in one drive triggers its twin into disaster mode. Fifty milliseconds. That\u2019s all you need for the full library to be replicated and partitioned, then rapidly off-loaded.\u201d\n\u201cOff-loaded where?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll assume that your sister has neighbors. Well, in this case every adjacent null-drive absorbs a little piece of your library. That\u2019s the standard protocol, years old and proven. You would have heard alarms announcing the event, and I\u2019d see the data begging to be noticed now.\u201d\nKleave was listening, and he wasn\u2019t listening. He was mostly focused on his anger and misery as well as the profound embarrassment. And this very unpleasant wizard and his technology were very impressive. Except Kleave didn\u2019t want to feel impressed just now. Pissed seemed like the perfect state of mind. \u201cOkay, the backup drive failed. Two daughters struck my archives at the same time. But what about my second backup? I\u2019m wearing a DNA chip that\u2019s nearly new.\u201d\nA different tool appeared, blunt and dark. It quickly dropped to his hip, settling on the left side.\n\u201cI see one Amber Forever Repository, last year\u2019s model.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I bought it.\u201d Kleave didn\u2019t remember the cost, but vivid wet-memories reminded him about the monthly payment. \u201cIt\u2019s a state-of-the-art masterpiece. That\u2019s what my research said.\u201d\n\u201cThe Amber Forever is basically good. But there was an enzyme update three months after it reached the market.\u201d\n\u201cI did that update.\u201d\n\u201cDid you?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Kleave was aiming for confidence. He wanted to put an end to this professional disgust. But he was also suffering a faint recollection, something about a little chore going unfinished. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s say the update wasn\u2019t done or done properly. What does that mean for me?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the null-drive in your skull fails, the Amber Forever should prepare for a retrieval of its inventory. But the original enzymatic matrix had a flaw. Without that critical update, there\u2019s a one-in-seventeen chance that the DNA self-wipes itself.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why the hell would it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s standard protection for encrypted files. Popular with intelligence agencies and media empires.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m neither of those things.\u201d\n\u201cBut that is what the Amber Forever was. Before the commercial models were released, it was the archive that could never be beaten.\u201d\n\u201cI feel beaten,\u201d Kleave said.\n\u201c\u2018Obliteration.\u2019 That\u2019s the industry\u2019s term for this business.\u201d\nThere was no way to calculate this awful luck. A single particle coming from outside the galaxy had burned out two innocent null-drives, and after that happened, an array of DNA washed away everything that it had ever learned. Kleave wanted to hit something. Not the wizard, since he might take offense. But attacking one of the walls seemed reasonable. The virtual office offered fake shelves full of photographs that must mean something to its owner. Kleave could throw every portrait to the floor and then stomp them under his feet. That seemed halfway suitable, pretending to destroy another man\u2019s invincible memories.\nAnd thoroughly stupid too. With a defeated sigh, Kleave asked, \u201cSo what do you advise?\u201d\nThe wizard sat up and offered a suddenly eager smile. \u201cStandard procedure would be for you to remove the null-drive from your neck and grab its mate from its box. With available methods, and patience, I should be able to recover . . . \u201d There was a pause. Technical aspects were in play, but the client\u2019s pain as well as his bank accounts needed to be weighed too. \u201cTwelve, maybe fourteen percent of your files would be retrieved. But a random sampling, with acceptable degradation of sensory quality.\u201d\n\u201cAcceptable degradation\u201d sounded like an eight percent recovery. That\u2019s how techno-juggling worked. Kleave decided to abuse the virtual floor, stomping hard, delivering a much-welcomed dose of pain to the soles of his feet.\n\u201cOf course I can borrow from other people\u2019s archives,\u201d the wizard continued. \u201cFriends and family will be easy enough, and sometimes you come across useful strangers. The goal is to harvest enough data and build a convincing likeness of your life experiences. Which will always be other people\u2019s experiences, except for the realigned perspective.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds expensive,\u201d Kleave said.\nThe man didn\u2019t disagree. Better to shrug with resignation, then tell the client, \u201cI\u2019m old. I was alive when memory was weak and people took snapshots to help us remember. But the pictures were simple and aged badly or got tossed out by mistake. So we threw slightly better photographs up on the cloud. But then came the Hacks of \u201929 and the advent of cheap, nearly infinite private storage. That\u2019s the history. That\u2019s why memory is weaker now than ever. Nobody remembers shit. We don\u2019t have to. Everything that happens is clean and pressed, eagerly waiting for us, and we don\u2019t know what to do without it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think the cost would be worthwhile?\u201d\n\u201cTo me, recovery would be priceless.\u201d\n\u201cExcept you won\u2019t ever have my troubles. Will you? I bet you have more than three archives.\u201d\nA big smile, a slow nod. \u201cSix of them, and four languages. And three null-drives are secured inside deep vaults, on separate continents.\u201d\nKleave gave the floor another hard kick.\nWhich the wizard noticed. But Kleave\u2019s misfortune deserved a warm little smile. What mattered now was to make the sale, and that\u2019s why he leaned forward. \u201cBut really, you aren\u2019t a careless fool. You\u2019re not like the usual cases that I see. What happened to you . . . well, it\u2019s remarkably rare, and in so many ways.\u201d\n\u201cOthers suffer like this?\u201d\n\u201cThe Obliteration of Everything. It happens all the time. Usually when a single old and badly maintained archive fails.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s when Kleave detected the faint beginnings of something that wasn\u2019t pleasurable, no. But suddenly this situation wasn\u2019t as lonely or quite as horrible as it once seemed.\nDoobie was a woman of appetites and ideas and loud, blunt enthusiasms. She could be lovely and she was always physically impressive, but when his partner was sick, she became radiant. Illness was an event worth experiencing. Something about a good fever made Doobie more vivid, and Kleave secretly looked forward to the days when he had to serve as a tireless nurse to this complaining beast.\nBut Kleave\u2019s illnesses and mishaps were never as well-received.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t take care of your archives,\u201d Doobie told him.\n\u201cI did what I could, and I thought it was enough,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat enzyme update,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you or didn\u2019t you do the mandatory update?\u201d\nWith nothing but his soggy brain in play, Kleave couldn\u2019t remember anything with certainty. But \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d seemed dangerous. Instead, I redirected the conversation by saying, \u201cYou should have been with me. To ask questions and punch the walls for me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that would have helped how?\u201d Doobie always found excuses when her roommate visited a physician, AI or otherwise. And apparently it was the same for tech-wizards. \u201cNo, I\u2019m too angry to sit. Too furious to ask questions. We\u2019re together all these years, and now, because of all these little catastrophes, you\u2019ve lost everything that we\u2019ve ever shared.\u201d\nDoobie used to be flat-chested and then she was a buxom lady, but now she was back to the original shape. And those were just a few of the changes with a topography that was never quite happy with itself. Yet every version of Doobie had lived inside archives that Kleave trusted as much as his next deep breath. An infinitely complex apparition had lived inside his null-drives\u2014a wondrous lady that shared the world with him all the way back to college. For years, they remained stubbornly unaware of each other\u2019s existence. But re-woven eyes meant that every glance was recorded, and auditory sinks meant that every overheard word was real. Doobie was the big and pretty girl on the track-and-field team who threw the shot farther than any other woman. And Kleave? The handsome if rather shy boy who looked at his future partner exactly 156 times before finally noticing her wonders.\nThey went to the public Mars on their fifth date. They were already lovers, and that particular day didn\u2019t offer any special fun. But worlds were the same as people. Sometimes it took 156 inadequate glances before you noticed what was precious. Or sometimes it took seven visits and staring into the throat of a reborn volcano, and then the two of you emerged ready to stop dating other people, at least for the time being.\nThat\u2019s the promise Kleave made to Doobie and to himself. Though she was never as enthusiastic towards monogamy. They often shared archives, and sometimes he caught glimpses of other sexual adventures. Of course digital records had another spectacular power: The unwelcome and unseemly could be purged. A jealous-minded lover could make those bad minutes go away. Except Kleave never did make that effort. The way he looked at it, his partner was a world of flesh recorded in staggering detail, and he would never throw away anything that was Doobie. Each touch and the smell of her breath was waiting to be remembered, and even the flavor of his sweat mixed with hers. Kleave always wanted those joys close. Just as he never wanted to stop hearing that strong lady who was never ashamed to speak her mind.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Doobie. \u201cRegardless of blame, you\u2019ll of course get this problem fixed.\u201d\nKleave stared at his roommate. This woman. Her hair was short, the clothes casual, bare toes digging into the stones resting beside a Martian river, cool water charging down a new canyon, making for the cobalt sea.\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive,\u201d he began.\n\u201cAnd I know that,\u201d she interrupted. Except her knowledge didn\u2019t push very far into the finances. She didn\u2019t sit in the wizard\u2019s office, and she didn\u2019t show the slightest interest in liability law or Kleave\u2019s financial resources. And she absolutely hadn\u2019t put in the hours that he had spent researching this business of Obliteration. Which was perfectly named, and as he had learned, far more common than he would have guessed yesterday.\n\u201cJust pulling what remains from the two null-drives,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would cost more than ten days on Disney-Burroughs.\u201d\nOn that Mars, Doobie played the powerful princess.\nBut this woman, the one standing before him, wasn\u2019t a princess. And this Doobie wasn\u2019t the splendid force of nature that he loved. That idea arrived suddenly, entirely by surprise, and then it refused to let him go.\n\u201cWell, someone should pay for this,\u201d the stranger said.\n\u201cLike who?\u201d Kleave asked.\n\u201cThe companies that built these awful drives. They should be happy to replace everything that failed.\u201d\n\u201cThe Amber Drive is under warranty,\u201d he mentioned. \u201cI\u2019m entitled to a new, updated model.\u201d\nBut then Doobie found a larger target. \u201cA government that cares for its citizens, that educates us and treasures us . . . that sort of government should protect our pasts too. With a shared repository, or something else along those lines.\u201d\nKleave didn\u2019t see how any of these words helped.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet,\u201d she said.\nHe agreed with silence.\nThen the original, most urgent question returned. \u201cSo how did you let this happen?\u201d\nObviously this woman was a stranger. Kleave\u2019s Doobie was eleven years of vivid existence, while this was just a thin slice of one mostly unknown existence. Her name didn\u2019t matter. Kleave stared at the short hair and brown face and the anger that seemed quite familiar, but without the help of the archives ready to blunt the bad moments, offering up treasured moments and perfect long days.\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you answer me?\u201d\nKleave didn\u2019t particularly like this woman.\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d the stranger asked.\n\u201cThat I can\u2019t afford to do anything about anything,\u201d he said. \u201cExcept outfit myself with new archives. And since your equipment isn\u2019t any better than mine, we need to give you more backups too.\u201d\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t lose anything,\u201d she said.\nWhat did that mean?\n\u201cMy in nubibus and yours are always side-by-side,\u201d she said. \u201cBut did any of my archives die?\u201d\n\u201cRadioactive daughters are tiny.\u201d\n\u201cI know that.\u201d\n\u201cThis was just stupid bad luck,\u201d he said.\nA heavy, doubtful sigh.\n\u201cOr did I have a plan? Is that what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d That idea sounded spectacularly paranoid, even in her ugly mood. \u201cWhere would such an idea even come from?\u201d\n\u201cBecause this was nothing but an accident,\u201d Kleave said. At least those were the words that came out of him. Except his voice felt wrong, as if he was nothing but the bottle carrying the expected sentence.\nShe became the silent one now.\n\u201cI need to leave,\u201d he said.\nThis Doobie shifted her weight. \u201cOkay. Sure.\u201d Staring at the pathetic man was painful. Kleave had lost every second that they had ever shared, and it took all of her grace to say a few obvious words. \u201cYou\u2019re off to get some new archives. Right?\u201d\nThat plan was set. He had addresses written on paper, yes. But Kleave said, \u201cNo. First I\u2019m going to go to my sister\u2019s and collect the other dead null-drive.\u201d\nThe old Doobie had always feuded with Kleave\u2019s sister.\nThis Doobie seemed much the same. \u201cFine. You do that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Then she thought about it, hard. And again, she said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nAnd for the first time in days, Kleave physically left their home. The apartment was no bigger than a space capsule bound for another world. Outdoors, the world turned huge. Pausing on a street corner, Kleave contemplated the idea that he could go anywhere and do almost anything, and no record of his adventures would be baked into some useless slab of Forever Amber.\nFull names weren\u2019t offered. That\u2019s what Kleave noticed first. Just a single name and some people shook hands while others didn\u2019t, depending on a lot of factors, including the quality of their in nubibus. Kleave couldn\u2019t grasp anyone\u2019s hand. He was inside an old cheap and very public machine, which meant that he could smell the dozens of strangers who had used it already that day. The experience wasn\u2019t as awful as he would have guessed, but this was an experience that he wouldn\u2019t happily do again either.\n\u201cHello there, Kleave,\u201d an older woman said. \u201cAnd by the way. You have our permission to smile.\u201d\nHe smiled at the smiling group.\nAnd in a chorus, they shouted, \u201cHello, Kleave.\u201d\nOBLITERATED BY CHOICE. That was the official name for an organization dedicated to living without the modern burdens. At least that was the stated purpose in the literature that came up high in every search into Obliteration. This meeting was one of eighty currently happening, and he selected it for no reason but the location. This was the well-loved Mars. And in particular, a couple dozen believers had gathered east of Hellas, inside the damp redwood forest where ferns grew taller by the minute and enhanced gibbons rode gigantic tame eagles, hunting for tourists that would throw them baubles, or better, gold coins.\nKleave and Doobie had talked about coming to this district. And now he was here, as without her as he could be.\nThe gray lady seemed to be the group\u2019s leader. \u201cAnd what brings you to us today, Kleave?\u201d\nBeing with strangers meant freedom, and even better, Kleave loved being unable to remember even a few of their names. Honesty. That was a quality that he often avoided with people who recorded everything. In that spirit, the new man surrendered a quick description of his day, centering on the major failures of proven technologies.\nSome people were impressed, but most preferred superstition. The leader in particular. \u201cWell, obviously, the gods have steered you to us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou should take this wonderful day as a clear, unimpeachable sign.\u201d\nAll right. That wasn\u2019t the expected response. But again, Kleave felt free to tell them, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any gods. The galaxy turns on its own.\u201d\nThat won giggles from several faces, and from the high branches, laughing gibbons.\n\u201cBad luck is nothing but bad luck,\u201d he told everyone.\nThen one man said, \u201cYet you haven\u2019t replaced your archives. Have you?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet, no.\u201d\n\u201cGods or not, you seem ready for a different course.\u201d\nTestimonies. Suddenly everyone had to share earnest tales about how good life was without re-woven eyes and terabytes of absorption. Several of these passionate, possibly crazed believers came close enough to grab hold of him, then couldn\u2019t because his in nubibus was that awful. But their faces were pushing too close to his face, and although different people kept talking, all the same words were being said.\n\u201cThe old, proven memories.\u201d\n\u201cSo much better than null-sinks.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so much cheaper too.\u201d\nThen he posed what seemed like a reasonable, obvious question. \u201cHow do others react to your beliefs?\u201d\n\u201cBadly.\u201d Everyone said so, in every possible way, and there was no greater pleasure to be found. They boasted about being dismissed as outcasts, deviants, and moderately insane, or much worse than that. But the believers knew better. \u201cWe know best,\u201d they sang. Life without archives meant trusting a brain that did spectacular things for millions of years. These ancient neurons were forgetful and lovely because of it. Memory should be just like the brain it inhabited, soft and malleable. Parts of yesterday and most of last year were lost, but that was a very good thing. Ordinary life deserved to be discarded. All that mattered were the impressive and shocking days, and those very pleasurable moments that stood tall and bright inside the dreary gray of normal existence.\nWithout question, their enthusiasm for ignorance was impressive. They had mastered a logic that arrived with force. Kleave found himself believing everything just long enough to surprise himself. But then the doubter inside him would take charge, and he\u2019d have to squelch a laugh and a hard shake of the head. Ten minutes of passionate noise, and he still didn\u2019t know which side of the line to choose.\nThen someone wiggled a fingertip camera, naming the model while bragging about its cheapness and its terribly tiny memory. \u201cSo you can\u2019t catch more than a few special scenes,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing more than that.\u201d\nBut that was too much. Others became angry enough to curse, while their leader tried to staunch what was plainly an old political fight. \u201cNow we\u2019ve agreed to disagree, and let\u2019s focus back on Kleave.\u201d\nBut then one fellow stepped forward, and almost everyone else groaned. Which he appreciated. Scorn brought energy, and he couldn\u2019t keep his voice from shouting when he stated his own vision of life without mental aids.\n\u201cI don\u2019t accept written words,\u201d he stated.\n\u201cWhat can that mean?\u201d asked Kleave. \u201cYou don\u2019t read or write?\u201d\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how to do either.\u201d\nHow could anyone be illiterate? That seemed too bizarre.\nThen the old lady succeeded in touching the new recruit. Just for an instant, Kleave felt the pressure of fingers, and with a threadbare patience, she reported, \u201cOur Lauren had his brain worked with. Supposedly, he can\u2019t do more than recognize letters and some of their sounds.\u201d\n\u201cSupposedly\u201d was the most important word in that account.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe him,\u201d a younger woman admitted.\nBut that only encouraged the true believer. Looking and sounding like everyone else, except for the specific words that he used, Lauren stood tall while he explained, \u201cI live without artificial tricks or aids from any time in the last ten thousand years. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m the only pure one here.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s when a great fight broke out.\nNobody noticed when the newcomer, whatever his name, managed to slip off into the emerald ferns. Kleave walked until he couldn\u2019t hear any human. A gibbon and her eagle landed on the path before him, both begging for gold, and because nothing was real here, he gave them what they wanted badly\u2014a digital bauble that one swallowed whole, keeping it safe in the belly.\nHe walked a little farther into the Martian wilderness.\nBut as happens sometimes when a cheap in nubibus pushes against the limits of any data-drawn world, the ferns grew yellowy pale and the ground softened until every step landed on pillows, and the deep sky beyond the redwoods forgot which blue it should be.\nDoobie was sitting on the floor of the tiny apartment, tired of crying but not angry enough to stand when Kleave finally came home.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to your sister\u2019s,\u201d she began.\nThey owned two chairs, and he took the nearest one. It was the chair that Doobie preferred, and she didn\u2019t seem to notice.\n\u201cI got worried,\u201d she said. \u201cSo worried that when you didn\u2019t come home, I called that awful woman. Why does your sister hate me so much?\u201d\n\u201cYou were rude to her,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she does. It was the day when you two met, and you said some unkind words about . . . well, it doesn\u2019t matter what you said. The point is, she\u2019s never let those ten seconds get lost.\u201d\nDoobie was sick with misery. How wonderful!\n\u201cSo you called my sister, but she hadn\u2019t seen me. Is that right?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you might be leaving me,\u201d Doobie said.\n\u201cI considered it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd maybe you\u2019ve come back for your belongings?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\nThat broad body stiffened, and then hopelessness won. The old athlete seemed to turn to paste, soft and ready to flow. The weakest voice of her life said, \u201cI won\u2019t fight you. If you want to go.\u201d\nKleave abandoned the chair for the grimy floor. The two of them sat with legs crossed, facing not so much each other as the third corner in a tidy triangle. Looking at that empty space, he said, \u201cI went to Mars with strangers and learned a lot.\u201d\n\u201cGood for you.\u201d\n\u201cThen I finally walked to my sister\u2019s. Which wasn\u2019t long after you called her, by the way.\u201d\nStaring at the same bit of air, Doobie said nothing.\n\u201cLike I planned, I was going to retrieve the other broken null-drive.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d said Doobie.\nAnd then, \u201cI know what I said. When we met, I told your sister she was too pretty to ever ever ever be unhappy about anything.\u201d\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t like those words.\u201d\n\u201cI guess not.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway.\u201d A moment passed into another several moments, nothing memorable in the bunch. And then Kleave dropped a little piece of machinery on the dirty rug between them.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cAn old Intel archive,\u201d he said. \u201cMy archive, once. I found it in the lockbox with my irradiated archive. I\u2019d forgotten I put it there, or that it existed anywhere. And do you know what, Doobie?\u201d\n\u201cNo. What?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it was so easy to do, I plugged this old model into my new archive. One connection. That\u2019s all it took. And for the last eleven years, it\u2019s been backing up my null-drive, a terabyte at a time.\u201d\n\u201cEleven years?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nShe stared at him, hope buried under all the fear of being too hopeful. \u201cWas there room in the old drive for that much time?\u201d\n\u201cJust barely.\u201d\n\u201cSo now you can get your memories back?\u201d she asked.\nTo which Kleave said, \u201cI never lost my memories, darling. Just a big world made up of tiny, tiny days.\u201d\nRobert Reed is the author of nearly three hundred published stories, plus more than a dozen novels.

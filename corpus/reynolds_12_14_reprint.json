While she paused, Kathrin adjusted the drawstring on her hat, tilting the brim to shade her forehead from the sun. Though the air was still cool, there was a fierce new quality to the light that brought out her freckles.\nKathrin moved to continue, but a tightness in her throat made her hesitate. She had been keeping the bridge from her thoughts until this moment, but now the fact of it could not be ignored. Unless she crossed it she would face the long trudge to New Bridge, a diversion that would keep her on the road until long after sunset.\n\u201cSledge-maker\u2019s daughter!\u201d called a rough voice from across the road.\nKathrin turned sharply at the sound. An aproned man stood in a doorway, smearing his hands dry. He had a monkey-like face, tanned a deep liverish red, with white sideboards and a gleaming pink tonsure.\n\u201cBrendan Lynch\u2019s daughter, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nShe nodded meekly, but bit her lip rather than answer.\n\u201cThought so. Hardly one to forget a pretty face, me.\u201d The man beckoned her to the doorway of his shop. \u201cCome here, lass. I\u2019ve something for your father.\u201d\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\u201cI was hoping to visit him last week, but work kept me here.\u201d He cocked his head at the painted wooden trademark hanging above the doorway. \u201cPeter Rigby, the wheelwright. Kathrin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI need to be getting along, sir . . . \u201d\n\u201cAnd your father needs good wood, of which I\u2019ve plenty. Come inside for a moment, instead of standing there like a starved thing.\u201d He called over his shoulder, telling his wife to put the water on the fire.\nReluctantly Kathrin gathered her bags and followed Peter into his workshop. She blinked against the dusty air and removed her hat. Sawdust carpeted the floor, fine and golden in places, crisp and coiled in others, while a heady concoction of resins and glues filled the air. Pots simmered on fires. Wood was being steamed into curves, or straightened where it was curved. Many sharp tools gleamed on one wall, some of them fashioned with blades of skydrift. Wheels, mostly awaiting spokes or iron tires, rested against another. Had the wheels been sledges, it could have been her father\u2019s workshop, when he had been busier.\nPeter showed Kathrin to an empty stool next to one of his benches. \u201cSit down here and take the weight off your feet. Mary can make you some bread and cheese. Or bread and ham if you\u2019d rather.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind sir, but Widow Grayling normally gives me something to eat, when I reach her house.\u201d\nPeter raised a white eyebrow. He stood by the bench with his thumbs tucked into the belt of his apron, his belly jutting out as if he was quietly proud of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you visited the witch.\u201d\n\u201cShe will have her two hog\u2019s heads, once a month, and her candles. She only buys them from the Shield, not the Town. She pays for the hogs a year in advance, twenty-four whole pounds.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not scared by her?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve no cause to be.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s some that would disagree with you.\u201d\nRemembering something her father had told her, Kathrin said, \u201cThere are folk who say the Sheriff can fly, or that there was once a bridge that winked at travelers like an eye, or a road of iron that reached all the way to London. My father says there\u2019s no reason for anyone to be scared of Widow Grayling.\u201d\n\u201cNot afraid she\u2019ll turn you into a toad, then?\u201d\n\u201cShe cures people, not put spells on them.\u201d\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s in the mood for it. From what I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s just as likely to turn the sick and needy away.\u201d\n\u201cIf she helps some people, isn\u2019t that better than nothing at all?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose.\u201d She could tell Peter didn\u2019t agree, but he wasn\u2019t cross with her for arguing. \u201cWhat does your father make of you visiting the witch, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Peter asked, interestedly.\n\u201cWhen he was small, my dad cut his arm on a piece of skydrift that he found in the snow. He went to Widow Grayling and she made his arm better again by tying an eel around it. She didn\u2019t take any payment except the skydrift.\u201d\n\u201cDoes your father still believe an eel can heal a wound?\u201d\n\u201cHe says he\u2019ll believe anything if it gets the job done.\u201d\n\u201cWise man, that Brendan, a man after my own heart. Which reminds me.\u201d Peter ambled to another bench, pausing to stir one of his bubbling pots before gathering a bundle of sawn-off wooden sticks. He set them down in front of Kathrin on a scrap of cloth. \u201cOff cuts,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut good seasoned beech, which\u2019ll never warp. No use to me, but I am sure your father will find use for them. Tell him that there\u2019s more, if he wishes to collect it.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t got any money for wood.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d take none. Your father was always generous to me, when I was going through lean times.\u201d Peter scratched behind his ear. \u201cOnly fair, the way I see it.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kathrin said doubtfully. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think I can carry the wood all the way home.\u201d\n\u201cNot with two hog\u2019s heads as well. But you can drop by when you\u2019ve given the heads to Widow Grayling.\u201d\n\u201cOnly I won\u2019t be coming back over the river,\u201d Kathrin said. \u201cAfter I\u2019ve crossed Twenty Arch Bridge, I\u2019ll go back along the south quayside and take the ferry at Jarrow.\u201d\nPeter looked puzzled. \u201cWhy line the ferryman\u2019s pocket when you can cross the bridge for nowt?\u201d\nKathrin shrugged easily. \u201cI\u2019ve got to visit someone on the Jarrow road, to settle an account.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better take the wood now, I suppose,\u201d Peter said.\nMary bustled in, carrying a small wooden tray laden with bread and ham. She was as plump and red as her husband, only shorter. Picking up the entire gist of the conversation in an instant, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be an oaf, Peter. The girl cannot carry all that wood and her bags. If she will not come back this way, she must pass a message onto her father. Tell him that there\u2019s wood here if he wants it.\u201d She shook her head sympathetically at Kathrin. \u201cWhat does he think you are, a pack mule?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell my father about the wood,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSeasoned beech,\u201d Peter said emphatically. \u201cRemember that.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\nMary encouraged her to take some of the bread and meat, despite Kathrin again mentioning that she expected to be fed at Widow Grayling\u2019s. \u201cTake it anyway,\u201d Mary said. \u201cYou never know how hungry you might get on the way home. Are you sure about not coming back this way?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d best not,\u201d Kathrin said.\nAfter an awkward lull, Peter said, \u201cThere is something else I meant to tell your father. Could you let him know that I\u2019ve no need of a new sledge this year, after all?\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Mary said. \u201cYou promised.\u201d\n\u201cI said that I should probably need one. I was wrong in that.\u201d Peter looked exasperated. \u201cThe fault lies in Brendan, not me! If he did not make such good and solid sledges, then perhaps I should need another by now.\u201d\n\u201cI shall tell him,\u201d Kathrin said.\n\u201cIs your father keeping busy?\u201d Mary asked.\n\u201cAye,\u201d Kathrin answered, hoping the wheelwright\u2019s wife wouldn\u2019t push her on the point.\n\u201cOf course he will still be busy,\u201d Peter said, helping himself to some of the bread. \u201cPeople don\u2019t stop needing sledges, just because the Great Winter loosens its hold on us. Any more than they stopped needing wheels when the winter was at its coldest. It\u2019s still cold for half the year!\u201d\nKathrin opened her mouth to speak. She meant to tell Peter that he could pass the message onto her father directly, for he was working not five minutes walk from the wheelwright\u2019s shop. Peter clearly had no knowledge that her father had left the village, leaving his workshop empty during these warming months. But she realized that her father would be ashamed if the wheelwright were to learn of his present trade. It was best that nothing be said.\n\u201cKathrin?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u201cI should be getting on. Thank you for the food, and the offer of the wood.\u201d\n\u201cYou pass our regards onto your father,\u201d Mary said.\n\u201cI shall.\u201d\n\u201cGod go with you. Watch out for the jangling men.\u201d\n\u201cI will,\u201d Kathrin replied, because that was what you were supposed to say.\n\u201cBefore you go,\u201d Peter said suddenly, as if a point had just occurred to him. \u201cLet me tell you something. You say there are people who believe the Sheriff can fly, as if that was a foolish thing, like the iron road and the winking bridge. I cannot speak of the other things, but when I was boy I met someone who had seen the Sheriff\u2019s flying machine. My grandfather often spoke of it. A whirling thing, like a windmill made of tin. He had seen it when he was a boy, carrying the Sheriff and his men above the land faster than any bird.\u201d\n\u201cIf the Sheriff could fly then, why does he need a horse and carriage now?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the flying machine crashed down to Earth, and no tradesman could persuade it to fly again. It was a thing of the old world, before the Great Winter. Perhaps the winking bridge and the iron road were also things of the old world. We mock too easily, as if we understood everything of our world where our forebears understood nothing.\u201d\n\u201cBut if I should believe in certain things,\u201d Kathrin said, \u201cshould I not also believe in others? If the Sheriff can fly, then can a jangling man not steal me from my bed at night?\u201d\n\u201cThe jangling men are a story to stop children misbehaving,\u201d Peter said witheringly. \u201cHow old are you now?\u201d\n\u201cSixteen,\u201d Kathrin answered.\n\u201cI am speaking of something that was seen, in daylight, not made up to frighten bairns.\u201d\n\u201cBut people say they have seen jangling men. They have seen men made of tin and gears, like the inside of a clock.\u201d\n\u201cSome people were frightened too much when they were small,\u201d Peter said, with a dismissive shake. \u201cNo more than that. But the Sheriff is real, and he was once able to fly. That\u2019s God\u2019s truth.\u201d\nHer hands were hurting again by the time she reached Twenty Arch Bridge. She tugged down the sleeves of her sweater, using them as mittens. Rooks and jackdaws wheeled and cawed overhead. Seagulls feasted on waste floating in the narrow races between the bridge\u2019s feet, or pecked at vile leavings on the road that had been missed by the night soil gatherers. A boy laughed as Kathrin nearly tripped on the labyrinth of criss-crossing ruts that had been etched by years of wagon wheels entering and leaving the bridge. She hissed a curse back at the boy, but now the wagons served her purpose. She skulked near a doorway until a heavy cart came rumbling along, top-heavy with beer barrels from the Blue Star Brewery, drawn by four snorting dray-horses, a bored-looking drayman at the reins, huddled so down deep into his leather coat that it seemed as if the Great Winter still had its icy hand on the country.\nKathrin started walking as the cart lumbered past her, using it as a screen. Between the stacked beer barrels she could see the top level of the scaffolding that was shoring up the other side of the arch, visible since no house or parapet stood on that part of the bridge. A dozen or so workers\u2014including a couple of aproned foremen\u2014were standing on the scaffolding, looking down at the work going on below. Some of them had plumb lines; one of them even had a little black rod that shone a fierce red spot wherever he wanted something moved. Of Garret, the reason she wished to cross the bridge only once if she could help it, there was nothing to be seen. Kathrin hoped that he was under the side of the bridge, hectoring the workers. She felt sure that her father was down there too, being told what to do and biting his tongue against answering back. He put up with being shouted at, he put up with being forced to treat wood with crude disrespect, because it was all he could do to earn enough money to feed and shelter himself and his daughter. And he never, ever, looked Garret Kinnear in the eye.\nKathrin felt her mood easing as the dray ambled across the bridge, nearing the slight rise over the narrow middle arches. The repair work, where Garret was most likely to be, was now well behind her. She judged her progress by the passage of alehouses. She had passed the newly painted Bridge Inn and the shuttered gloom of the Lord\u2019s Confessor. Fiddle music spilled from the open doorway of the Dancing Panda: an old folksong with nonsense lyrics about sickly sausage rolls.\nAhead lay the Winged Man, its sign containing a strange painting of a foreboding figure rising from a hilltop. If she passed the Winged Man, she felt she would be safe.\nThen the dray hit a jutting cobblestone and rightmost front wheel snapped free of its axle. The wheel wobbled off on its own. The cart tipped to the side, spilling beer barrels onto the ground. Kathrin stepped nimbly aside as one of the barrels ruptured and sent its fizzing, piss-colored contents across the roadway. The horses snorted and strained. The drayman spat out a greasy wad of chewing tobacco and started down from his chair, his face a mask of impassive resignation, as if this was the kind of thing that could be expected to happen once a day. Kathrin heard him whisper something in the ear of one of the horses, in beast-tongue, which calmed the animal.\nKathrin knew that she had no choice but to continue. Yet she had no sooner resumed her pace\u2014moving faster now, the bags swaying awkwardly, than she saw Garret Kinnear. He was just stepping out of the Winged Man\u2019s doorway.\nHe smiled. \u201cYou in a hurry or something?\u201d\nKathrin tightened her grip on the bags, as if she was going to use them as weapons. She decided not to say anything, not to openly acknowledge his presence, even though their eyes had met for an electric instant.\n\u201cGetting to be a big strong girl now, Kathrin Lynch.\u201d\nShe carried on walking, each step taking an eternity. How foolish she had been, to take Twenty Arch Bridge when it would only have cost her another hour to take the further crossing. She should not have allowed Peter to delay her with his good intentions.\n\u201cYou want some help with them bags of yours?\u201d\nOut of the corner of her eye she saw him move out of the doorway, tugging his mud-stained trousers higher onto his hip. Garret Kinnear was snake thin, all skin and bone, but much stronger than he looked. He wiped a hand across his sharp beardless chin. He had long black hair, the greasy grey color of dishwater.\n\u201cGo away,\u201d she hissed, hating herself in the same instant.\n\u201cJust making conversation,\u201d he said.\nKathrin quickened her pace, glancing nervously around. All of a sudden the bridge appeared deserted. The shops and houses she had yet to pass were all shuttered and silent. There was still a commotion going on by the dray, but no one there was paying any attention to what was happening further along the bridge.\n\u201cLeave me alone,\u201d Kathrin said.\nHe was walking almost alongside her now, between Kathrin and the road. \u201cNow what kind of way to talk is that, Kathrin Lynch? Especially after my offer to help you with them bags. What have you got in them, anyways?\u201d\n\u201cNothing that\u2019s any business of yours.\u201d\n\u201cI could be the judge of that.\u201d Before she could do anything, he\u2019d snatched the bag from her left hand. He peered into its dark depths, frowning. \u201cYou came all the way from Jarrow Ferry with this?\u201d\n\u201cGive me back the bag.\u201d\nShe reached for the bag, tried to grab it back, but he held it out of her reach, grinning cruelly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\u201cHow much would a pig\u2019s head be worth?\u201d\n\u201cYou tell me. There\u2019s only one pig around here.\u201d\nThey\u2019d passed the mill next to the Winged Man. There was a gap between the mill and the six-storey house next to it, where some improbably narrow property must once have existed. Garret turned down the alley, still carrying Kathrin\u2019s bag. He reached the parapet at the edge of the bridge and looked over the side. He rummaged in the bag and drew out the pig\u2019s head. Kathrin hesitated at the entrance to the narrow alley, watching as Garret held the head out over the roiling water.\n\u201cYou can have your pig back. Just come a wee bit closer.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can do what you did last time?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any complaints.\u201d He let the head fall, then caught it again, Kathrin\u2019s heart in her throat.\n\u201cYou know I couldn\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\u201cNot much to ask for a pig\u2019s head, is it?\u201d With his free hand, he fumbled open his trousers, tugging out the pale worm of his cock. \u201cYou did it before, and it didn\u2019t kill you. Why not now? I won\u2019t trouble you again.\u201d\nShe watched his cock stiffen. \u201cYou said that last time.\u201d\n\u201cAye, but this time I mean it. Come over here, Kathrin. Be a good girl now and you\u2019ll have your pig back.\u201d\nKathrin looked back over her shoulder. No one was going to disturb them. The dray had blocked all the traffic behind it, and nothing was coming over the bridge from the south.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d she said.\n\u201cJust this once,\u201d Garret said. \u201cAnd make your mind up fast, girl. This pig\u2019s getting awfully heavy in my hand.\u201d\nKathrin stood in the widow\u2019s candlelit kitchen\u2014it only had one tiny, dusty window - while the old woman turned her bent back to attend to the coals burning in her black metal stove. She poked and prodded the fire until it hissed back like a cat. \u201cYou came all the way from Jarrow Ferry?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cAye,\u201d Kathrin said. The room smelled smoky.\n\u201cThat\u2019s too far for anyone, let alone a sixteen year old lass. I should have a word with your father. I heard he was working on Twenty Arch Bridge.\u201d\nKathrin shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI don\u2019t mind walking. The weather\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\u201cSo they say. All the same, the evenings are still cold, and there are types about you wouldn\u2019t care to meet on your own, miles from Jarrow.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back before it gets dark,\u201d Kathrin said, with more optimism than she felt. Not if she went out of her way to avoid Garret Kinnear she wouldn\u2019t. He knew the route she\u2019d normally take back home, and the alternatives would mean a much longer journey.\n\u201cYou sure about that?\u201d\n\u201cI have no one else to visit. I can start home now.\u201d Kathrin offered her one remaining bag, as Widow Grayling turned from the fire, brushing her hands on her apron.\n\u201cPut it on the table, will you?\u201d\nKathrin put the bag down. \u201cOne pig\u2019s head, and twenty candles, just as you wanted,\u201d she said brightly.\nWidow Grayling hobbled over to the table, supporting herself with a stick, eyeing Kathrin as she opened the bag and took out the solitary head. She weighed it in her hand then set it down on the table, the head facing Kathrin in such a way that its beady black eyes and smiling snout suggested amused complicity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good head,\u201d the widow said. \u201cBut there were meant to be two of them.\u201d\n\u201cCan you manage with just the one, until I visit again? I\u2019ll have three for you next time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage if I must. Was there a problem with the butcher in the Shield?\u201d\nKathrin had considered feigning ignorance, saying that she did not recall how only one head had come to be in her bags. But she knew Widow Grayling too well for that.\n\u201cDo you mind if I sit down?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d The widow hobbled around the table to one of the rickety stools and dragged it out. \u201cAre you all right, girl?\u201d\nKathrin lowered herself onto the stool.\n\u201cThe other bag was taken from me,\u201d she answered quietly.\n\u201cBy who?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone on the bridge.\u201d\n\u201cChildren?\u201d\n\u201cA man.\u201d\nWidow Grayling nodded slowly, as if Kathrin\u2019s answer had only confirmed some deep-seated suspicion she had harbored for many years. \u201cThomas Kinnear\u2019s boy, was it?\u201d\n\u201cHow could you know?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve lived long enough to form ready opinions of people. Garret Kinnear is filth. But there\u2019s no one that\u2019ll touch him, because they\u2019re scared of his father. Even the Sheriff tugs his forelock to Thomas Kinnear. Did he rape you?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But he wanted me to do something nearly as bad.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did he make you?\u201d\nKathrin looked away.\n\u201cNot this time.\u201d\nWidow Grayling closed her eyes. She reached across the table and took one of Kathrin\u2019s hands, squeezing it between her own. \u201cWhen was it?\u201d\n\u201cThree months ago, when there was still snow on the ground. I had to cross the bridge on my own. It was later than usual, and there weren\u2019t any people around. I knew about Garret already, but I\u2019d managed to keep away from him. I thought I was going to be lucky.\u201d Kathrin turned back to face her companion. \u201cHe caught me and took me into one of the mills. The wheels were turning, but there was nobody inside except me and Garret. I struggled, but then he put his finger to my lips and told me to shush.\u201d\n\u201cBecause of your father.\u201d\n\u201cIf I made trouble, if I did not do what he wanted, Garret would tell his father some lie about mine. He would say that he caught him sleeping on the job, or drunk, or stealing nails.\u201d\n\u201cGarret promised you that?\u201d\n\u201cHe said, life\u2019s hard enough for a sledge-maker\u2019s daughter when no one wants sledges. He said it would only be harder if my father lost his work.\u201d\n\u201cIn that respect he was probably right,\u201d the widow said resignedly. \u201cIt was brave of you to hold your silence, Kathrin. But the problem hasn\u2019t gone away, has it? You cannot avoid Garret forever.\u201d\n\u201cI can take the other bridge.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll make no difference, now that he has his eye on you.\u201d\nKathrin looked down at her hands. \u201cThen he\u2019s won already.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he just thinks that he has.\u201d Without warning the widow stood from her chair. \u201cHow long have we known each other, would you say?\u201d\n\u201cSince I was small.\u201d\n\u201cAnd in all that time, have I come to seem any older to you?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always seemed the same to me, Widow Lynch.\u201d\n\u201cAn old woman. The witch on the hill.\u201d\n\u201cThere are good witches and bad witches,\u201d Kathrin pointed out.\n\u201cAnd there are mad old women who don\u2019t belong in either category. Wait a moment.\u201d\nWidow Grayling stooped under the impossibly low doorway into the next room. Kathrin heard a scrape of wood on wood, as of a drawer being opened. She heard rummaging sounds. Widow Grayling returned with something in her hands, wrapped in red cotton. Whatever it was, she put it down on the table. By the noise it made Kathrin judged that it was an item of some weight and solidity.\n\u201cI was just like you once. I grew up not far from Ferry, in the darkest, coldest years of the Great Winter.\u201d\n\u201cHow long ago?\u201d\n\u201cThe Sheriff then was William the Questioner. You won\u2019t have heard of him.\u201d Widow Grayling sat down in the same seat she\u2019d been using before and quickly exposed the contents of the red cotton bundle.\nKathrin wasn\u2019t quite sure what she was looking at. There was a thick and unornamented bracelet, made of some dull grey metal like pewter. Next to the ornament was something like the handle of a broken sword: a grip, with a crissed-crossed pattern on it, with a curved guard reaching from one end of the hilt to the other. It was fashioned from the same dull grey metal.\n\u201cPick it up,\u201d the widow said. \u201cFeel it.\u201d\nKathrin reached out tentatively and closed her finger around the criss-crossed hilt. It felt cold and hard and not quite the right shape for her hand. She lifted it from the table, feeling its weight.\n\u201cWhat is it, widow?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s yours. It\u2019s a thing that has been in my possession for a very long while, but now it must change hands.\u201d\nKathrin didn\u2019t know quite what to say. A gift was a gift, but neither she nor her father would have any use for this ugly broken thing, save for its value to a scrap man.\n\u201cWhat happened to the sword?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThere was never a sword. The thing you are holding is the entire object.\u201d\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t understand what it is for.\u201d\n\u201cYou shall, in time. I\u2019m about to place a hard burden on your shoulders. I have often thought that you were the right one, but I wished to wait until you were older, stronger. But what has happened today cannot be ignored. I am old and weakening. It would be a mistake to wait another year.\u201d\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cTake the bracelet. Put it on your wrist.\u201d\nKathrin did as she was told. The bracelet opened on a heavy hinge, like a manacle. When she locked it together, the join was nearly invisible. It was a cunning thing, to be sure. But it still felt as heavy and dead and useless as the broken sword.\nKathrin tried to keep a composed face, while all the while suspecting that the widow was as mad as people had always said.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, with as much sincerity as she could muster.\n\u201cNow listen to what I have to say. You walked across the bridge today. Doubtless you passed the inn known as the Winged Man.\u201d\n\u201cIt was where Garret caught up with me.\u201d\n\u201cDid it ever occur to you to wonder where the name of the tavern comes from?\u201d\n\u201cMy dad told me once. He said the tavern was named after a metal statue that used to stand on a hill to the south, on the Durham road.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did your father explain the origin of this statue?\u201d\n\u201cHe said some people reckoned it had been up there since before the Great Winter. Other people said an old sheriff had put it up. Some other people . . . \u201d But Kathrin trailed off.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s silly, but they said a real Winged Man had come down, out of the sky.\u201d\n\u201cAnd did your father place any credence in that story?\u201d\n\u201cNot really,\u201d Kathrin said.\n\u201cHe was right not to. The statue was indeed older than the Great Winter, when they tore it down. It was not put up to honor the sheriff, or commemorate the arrival of a Winged Man.\u201d Now the widow looked at her intently. \u201cBut a Winged Man did come down. I know what happened, Kathrin: I saw the statue with my own eyes, before the Winged Man fell. I was there.\u201d\nKathrin shifted. She was growing uncomfortable in the widow\u2019s presence.\n\u201cMy dad said people reckoned the Winged Man came down hundreds of years ago.\u201d\n\u201cIt did.\u201d\n\u201cThen you can\u2019t have been there, Widow Grayling.\u201d\n\u201cBecause if I had been, I should be dead by now? You\u2019re right. By all that is natural, I should be. I was born three hundred years ago, Kathrin. I\u2019ve been a widow for more than two hundred of those years, though not always under this name. I\u2019ve moved from house to house, village to village, as soon as people start suspecting what I am. I found the Winged Man when I was sixteen years old, just like you.\u201d\nKathrin smiled tightly. \u201cI want to believe you.\u201d\n\u201cYou will, shortly. I already told you that this was the coldest time of the Great Winter. The sun was a cold grey disk, as if it was made of ice itself. For years the river hardly thawed at all. The Frost Fair stayed almost all year round. It was nothing like the miserable little gatherings you have known. This was ten times bigger, a whole city built on the frozen river. It had streets and avenues, its own quarters. There were tents and stalls, with skaters and sledges everywhere. There\u2019d be races, jousting competitions, fireworks, mystery players, even printing presses to make newspapers and souvenirs just for the Frost Fair. People came from miles around to see it, Kathrin: from as far away as Carlisle or York.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t they get bored with it, if it was always there?\u201d\n\u201cIt was always changing, though. Every few months there was something different. You would travel fifty miles to see a new wonder if enough people started talking about it. And there was no shortage of wonders, even if they were not always quite what you had imagined when you set off on your journey. Things fell from the sky more often in those days. A living thing like the Winged Man was still a rarity, but other things came down regularly enough. People would spy where they fell and try to get there first. Usually all they\u2019d find would be bits of hot metal, all warped and runny like melted sugar.\u201d\n\u201cSkydrift,\u201d Kathrin said. \u201cMetal that\u2019s no use to anyone, except barbers and butchers.\u201d\n\u201cOnly because we can\u2019t make fires hot enough to make that metal smelt down like iron or copper. Once, we could. But if you could find a small piece with an edge, there was nothing it couldn\u2019t cut through. A surgeon\u2019s best knife will always be skydrift.\u201d\n\u201cSome people think the metal belongs to the jangling men, and that anyone who touches it will be cursed.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure the sheriff does nothing to persuade them otherwise. Do you think the jangling men care what happens to their metal?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they care, because I don\u2019t think they exist.\u201d\n\u201cI was once of the same opinion. Then something happened to make me change my mind.\u201d\n\u201cThis being when you found the Winged Man, I take it.\u201d\n\u201cBefore even that. I would have been thirteen, I suppose. It was in the back of a tent in the Frost Fair. There was a case holding a hand made of metal, found among skydrift near Wallsend.\u201d\n\u201cA rider\u2019s gauntlet.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. It was broken off at the wrist, but you could tell that it used to belong to something that was also made of metal. There were metal bones and muscles in it. No cogs or springs, like in a clock or tin toy. This was something finer, more ingenious. I don\u2019t believe any man could have made it. But it cannot just be the jangling men who drop things from the sky, or fall out of it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Kathrin asked, in the spirit of someone going along with a game.\n\u201cBecause it was said that the sheriff\u2019s men once found a head of skin and bone, all burned up, but which still had a pair of spectacles on it. The glass in them was dark like coal, but when the sheriff wore them, he could see at night like a wolf. Another time, his men found a shred of garment that kept changing color, depending on what it was lying against. You could hardly see it then. Not enough to make a suit, but you could imagine how useful that would have been to the sheriff\u2019s spies.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019d have wanted to get to the Winged Man first.\u201d\nWidow Grayling nodded. \u201cIt was just luck that I got to him first. I was on the Durham road, riding a mule, when he fell from the sky. Now, the law said that they would spike your head on the bridge if you touched something that fell on the Sheriff\u2019s land, especially skydrift. But everyone knew that the Sheriff could only travel so fast, even when he had his flying machine. It was a risk worth taking, so I took it, and I found the Winged Man, and he was still alive.\u201d\n\u201cWas he really a man?\u201d\n\u201cHe was a creature of flesh and blood, not a jangling man, but he was not like any man I had seen before. He was smashed and bent, like a toy that had been trodden on. When I found him he was covered in armor, hot enough to turn the snow to water and make the water hiss and bubble under him. I could only see his face. A kind of golden mask had come off, lying next to him. There were bars across his mask, like the head of the Angel on the tavern sign. The rest of him was covered in metal, jointed in a clever fashion. It was silver in places and black in others, where it had been scorched. His arms were metal wings, as wide across as the road itself if they had not been snapped back on themselves. Instead of legs he just had a long tail, with a kind of fluke at the end of it. I crept closer, watching the sky all around me for the sheriff\u2019s whirling machine. I was fearful at first, but when I saw the Winged Man\u2019s face I only wanted to do what I could for him. And he was dying. I knew it, because I\u2019d seen the same look on the faces of men hanging from the sheriff\u2019s killing poles.\u201d\n\u201cDid you talk to him?\u201d\n\u201cI asked him if he wanted some water. At first he just looked at me, his eyes pale as the sky, his lips opening and closing like a fish that has just been landed. Then he said \u2018Water will not help me.\u2019 Just those five words, in a dialect I didn\u2019t know. Then I asked him if there was anything else I could do to help him, all the while glancing over my shoulder in case anyone should come upon us. But the road was empty and the sky was clear. It took a long time for him to answer me again.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\u201cHe said \u2018Thank you, but there is nothing you can do for me.\u2019 Then I asked him if he was an angel. He smiled, ever so slightly. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018Not an angel, really. But I am a flier.\u2019 I asked him if there was a difference. He smiled again before answering me. \u2018Perhaps not, after all this time. Do you know of fliers, girl? Do any of you still remember the war?\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth. I said I knew nothing of a war, unless he spoke of the Battle of the Stadium of Light, which had only happened twenty years earlier. He looked sad, then, as if he had hoped for a different answer. I asked him if he was a kind of soldier. He said that he was. \u2018Fliers are warriors\u2019, he said. \u2018Men like me are fighting a great war, on your behalf, against an enemy you do not even remember.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cWhat enemy?\u201d\n\u201cThe jangling men. They exist, but not in the way we imagine them. They don\u2019t crawl in through bedroom windows at night, clacking tin-bodied things with skull faces and clockwork keys whirring from their backs. But they\u2019re real enough.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would such things exist?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019d been made to do the work of men on the other side of the sky, where men cannot breathe because the air is so thin. They made the jangling men canny enough that they could work without being told exactly what to do. But that already made them slyer than foxes. The jangling men coveted our world for themselves. That was before the Great Winter came in. The flier said that men like him\u2014special soldiers, born and bred to fight the jangling men\u2014were all that was holding them back.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he told you they were fighting a war, above the sky?\u201d\nSomething pained Widow Grayling. \u201cAll the years since haven\u2019t made it any easier to understand what the flier told me. He said that, just as there may be holes in a old piece of timber, one that has been eaten through by woodworm, so there may be holes in the sky itself. He said that his wings were not really to help him fly, but to help him navigate those tunnels in the sky, just as the wheels of a cart find their way into the ruts on a road.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. How can there be holes in the sky, when the air is already too thin to breathe?\u201d\n\u201cHe said that the fliers and the jangling men make these holes, just as armies may dig a shifting network of trenches and tunnels as part of a long campaign. It requires strength to dig a hole and more strength to shore it up when it has already been dug. In an army, it would be the muscle of men and horses and whatever machines still work. But the flier was talking about a different kind of strength altogether.\u201d The widow paused, then stared into Kathrin\u2019s eyes with a look of foreboding. \u201cHe told me where it came from, you see. And ever since then, I have seen the world with different eyes. It is a hard burden, Kathrin. But someone must bear it.\u201d\nWithout thinking, Kathrin said, \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I want to know.\u201d\n\u201cThat bracelet has been on your wrist for a few minutes now. Does it feel any different?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Kathrin said automatically, but as soon as she\u2019d spoken, as soon as she\u2019d moved her arm, she knew that it was not the case. The bracelet still looked the same, it still looked like a lump of cold dead metal, but it seemed to hang less heavily against her skin than when she\u2019d first put it on.\n\u201cThe flier gave it to me,\u201d Widow Grayling said, observing Kathrin\u2019s reaction. \u201cHe told me how to open his armor and find the bracelet. I asked why. He said it was because I had offered him water. He was giving me something in return for that kindness. He said that the bracelet would keep me healthy, make me strong in other ways, and that if anyone else was to wear it, it would cure them of many ailments. He said that it was against the common law of his people to give such a gift to one such as I, but he chose to do it anyway. I opened his armor, as he told me, and I found his arm, bound by iron straps to the inside of his wing, and broken like the wing itself. On the end of his arm was this bracelet.\u201d\n\u201cIf the bracelet had the power of healing, why was the Winged Man dying?\u201d\n\u201cHe said that there were certain afflictions it could not cure. He had been touched by the poisonous ichor of a jangling man, and the bracelet could do nothing for him now.\u201d\n\u201cI still do not believe in magic,\u201d Kathrin said carefully.\n\u201cCertain magics are real, though. The magic that makes a machine fly, or a man see in the dark. The bracelet feels lighter, because part of it has entered you. It is in your blood now, in your marrow, just as the jangling man\u2019s ichor was in the flier\u2019s. You felt nothing, and you will continue to feel nothing. But so long as you wear the bracelet, you will age much slower than anyone else. For centuries, no sickness or infirmity will touch you.\u201d\nKathrin stroked the bracelet. \u201cI do not believe this.\u201d\n\u201cI would not expect to you. In a year or two, you will feel no change in yourself. But in five years, or in ten, people will start to remark upon your uncommon youthfulness. For a while, you will glory in it. Then you will feel admiration turn slowly to envy and then to hate, and it will start to feel like a curse. Like me, you will need to move on and take another name. This will be the pattern of your life, while your wear the flier\u2019s charm.\u201d\nKathrin looked at the palms of her hand. It might have been imagination, but the lines where the handles had cut into her were paler and less sensitive to the touch.\n\u201cIs this how you heal people?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re as wise as I always guessed you were, Kathrin Lynch. Should you come upon someone who is ill, you need only place the bracelet around their wrist for a whole day and\u2014unless they have the jangling man\u2019s ichor in them - they will be cured.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of the other things? When my father hurt his arm, he said you tied an eel around his arm.\u201d\nHer words made the widow smile. \u201cI probably did. I could just as well have smeared pigeon dung on it instead, or made him wear a necklace of worms, for all the difference it would have made. Your father\u2019s arm would have mended itself on its own, Kathrin. The cut was deep, but clean. It did not need the bracelet to heal, and your father was neither stupid nor feverish. But he did have the loose tongue of all small boys. He would have seen the bracelet, and spoken of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen you did nothing.\u201d\n\u201cYour father believed that I did something. That was enough to ease the pain in his arm and perhaps allow it to heal faster than it would otherwise have done.\u201d\n\u201cBut you turn people away.\u201d\n\u201cIf they are seriously ill, but neither feverish nor unconscious, I cannot let them see the bracelet. There is no other way, Kathrin. Some must die, so that the bracelet\u2019s secret is protected.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the burden?\u201d Kathrin asked doubtfully.\n\u201cNo, this is the reward for carrying the burden. The burden is knowledge.\u201d\nAgain, Kathrin said, \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what the flier told me. The Great Winter fell across our world because the sun itself grew colder and paler. There was a reason for that. The armies of the celestial war were mining its fire, using the furnace of the sun itself to dig and shore up those seams in the sky. How they did this is beyond my comprehension, and perhaps even that of the flier himself. But he did make one thing clear. So long as the Great Winter held, the celestial war must still be raging. And that would mean that the jangling men had not yet won.\u201d\n\u201cBut the Thaw . . . \u201d Kathrin began.\n\u201cYes, you see it now. The snow melts from the land. Rivers flow, crops grow again. The people rejoice, they grow stronger and happier, skins darken, the Frost Fairs fade into memory. But they do not understand what it really means.\u201d\nKathrin hardly dared ask. \u201cWhich side is winning, or has already won?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know; that\u2019s the terrible part of it. But when the flier spoke to me, I sensed an awful hopelessness, as if he knew things were not going to go the way of his people.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m frightened now.\u201d\n\u201cYou should be. But someone needs to know, Kathrin, and the bracelet is losing its power to keep me out of the grave. Not because there is anything wrong with it, I think\u2014it heals as well as it has ever done\u2014but because it has decided that my time has grown sufficient, just as it will eventually decide the same thing with you.\u201d\nKathrin touched the other object, the thing that looked like a sword\u2019s handle.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cThe flier\u2019s weapon. His hand was holding it from inside the wing. It poked through the outside of the wing like the claw of a bat. The flier showed me how to remove it. It is yours as well.\u201d\nShe had touched it already, but this time Kathrin felt a sudden tingle as her fingers wrapped around the hilt. She let go suddenly, gasping as if she had reached for a stick and picked up an adder, squirming and slippery and venomous.\n\u201cYes, you feel its power,\u201d Widow Grayling said admiringly. \u201cIt works for no one unless they carry the bracelet.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\u201cBetter you have it, than let that power go to waste. If the jangling men come, then at least someone will have a means to hurt them. Until then, there are other uses for it.\u201d\nWithout touching the hilt, Kathrin slipped the weapon into her pocket where it lay as heavy and solid as a pebble.\n\u201cDid you ever use it?\u201d\n\u201cOnce.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\nShe caught a secretive smile on Widow Grayling\u2019s face. \u201cI took something precious from William the Questioner. Banished him to the ground like the rest of us. I meant to kill him, but he was not riding in the machine when I brought it down.\u201d\nKathrin laughed. Had she not felt the power of the weapon, she might have dismissed the widow\u2019s story as the ramblings of an old woman. But she had no reason in the world to doubt her companion.\n\u201cYou could have killed the sheriff later, when he came to inspect the killing poles.\u201d\n\u201cI nearly did. But something always stayed my hand. Then the sheriff was replaced by another man, and he in turn by another. Sheriffs came and went. Some were evil men, but not all of them. Some were only as hard and cruel as their office demanded. I never used the weapon again, Kathrin. I sensed that its power was not limitless, that it must be used sparingly, against the time when it became really necessary. But to use it in defense, against a smaller target . . . that would be a different matter, I think.\u201d\nKathrin thought she understood.\n\u201cI need to be getting back home,\u201d she said, trying to sound as if they had discussed nothing except the matter of the widow\u2019s next delivery of provisions. \u201cI am sorry about the other head.\u201d\n\u201cThere is no need to apologize. It was not your doing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will happen to you now, widow?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll fade, slowly and gracefully. Perhaps I will see things through to the next winter. But I don\u2019t expect to see another thaw.\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Take the bracelet back.\u201d\n\u201cKathrin, listen. It will make no difference to me now, whether you take it or not.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not old enough for this. I\u2019m only a girl from the Shield, a sledge-maker\u2019s daughter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think I was, when I found the flier? We were the same. I\u2019ve seen your strength and courage.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t strong today.\u201d\n\u201cYet you took the bridge, when you knew Garret would be on it. I have no doubt, Kathrin.\u201d\nShe stood. \u201cIf I had not lost the other head . . . if Garret had not caught me . . . would you have given me these things?\u201d\n\u201cI was minded to do it. If not today, it would have happened next time. But let us give Garret due credit. He helped me make up my mind.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s still out there,\u201d Kathrin said.\n\u201cBut he will know you will not be taking the bridge to get back home, even though that would save you paying the toll at Jarrow Ferry. He will content himself to wait until you cross his path again.\u201d\nKathrin collected her one remaining bag and moved to the door.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI will see you again, in a month. Give my regards to your father.\u201d\n\u201cI will.\u201d\nWidow Grayling opened the door. The sky was darkening to the east, in the direction of Jarrow Ferry. The dusk stars would appear shortly, and it would be dark within the hour. The crows were still wheeling, but more languidly now, preparing to roost. Though the Great Winter was easing, the evenings seemed as cold as ever, as if night was the final stronghold, the place where the winter had retreated when the inevitability of its defeat became apparent. Kathrin knew that she would be shivering long before she reached the tollgate at the crossing, miles down the river. She tugged down her hat in readiness for the journey and stepped onto the broken road in front of the widow\u2019s cottage.\n\u201cYou will take care now, Kathrin. Watch out for the janglies.\u201d\n\u201cI will, Widow Grayling.\u201d\nThe door closed behind her. She heard a bolt slide into place.\nShe was alone.\nKathrin set off, following the path she had used to climb up from the river. If it was arduous in daylight, it was steep and treacherous at dusk. As she descended she could see Twenty Arch Bridge from above, a thread of light across the shadowed ribbon of the river. Candles were being lit in the inns and houses that lined the bridge, tallow torches burning along the parapets. There was still light at the north end, where the sagging arch was being repaired. The obstruction caused by the dray had been cleared, and traffic was moving normally from bank to bank. She heard the calls of men and women, the barked orders of foremen, the braying of drunkards and slatterns, the regular creak and splash of the mill wheels turning under the arches.\nPresently she reached a fork in the path and paused. To the right lay the quickest route down to the quayside road to Jarrow Ferry. To the left lay the easiest descent down to the bridge, the path that she had already climbed. Until that moment, her resolve had been clear. She would take the ferry, as she always did, as she was expected to do.\nBut now she reached a hand into her pocket and closed her fingers around the flier\u2019s weapon. The shiver of contact was less shocking this time. The object already felt a part of her, as if she had carried it for years.\nShe drew it out. It gleamed in twilight, shining where it had appeared dull before. Even if the widow had not told her of its nature, there would have been no doubt now. The object spoke its nature through her skin and bones, whispering to her on a level beneath language. It told her what it could do and how she could make it obey her. It told her to be careful of the power she now carried in her hand. She must scruple to use it wisely, for nothing like it now existed in the world. It was the power to smash walls. Power to smash bridges and towers and flying machines. Power to smash jangling men.\nPower to smash ordinary men, if that was what she desired.\nShe had to know.\nThe last handful of crows gyred overhead. She raised the weapon to them and felt a sudden dizzying apprehension of their number and distance and position, each crow feeling distinct from its brethren, as if she could almost name them.\nShe selected one laggard bird. All the others faded from her attention, like players removing themselves from a stage. She came to know that last bird intimately. She could feel its wingbeats cutting the cold air. She could feel the soft thatch of its feathers, and the lacelike scaffolding of bone underneath. Within the cage of its chest she felt the tiny strong pulse of its heart, and she knew that she could make that heart freeze just by willing it.\nThe weapon seemed to urge her to do it. She came close. She came frighteningly close.\nBut the bird had done nothing to wrong her, and she spared it. She had no need to take a life to test this new gift, at least not an innocent one. The crow rejoined its brethren, something skittish and hurried in its flight, as if it had felt that coldness closing around its heart.\nKathrin returned the weapon to her pocket.

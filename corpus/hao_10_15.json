In the past, I always thought that either it was prearranged, and all we had to do was follow along; or that it didn\u2019t exist at all, so we had to devise our own path in life.\nI didn\u2019t realize there might be a third option.\nA\nIn August, I leave for my grandmother\u2019s home in the country, fleeing ruckus like Newton fled the Black Plague. I want a quiet summer, nothing more.\nThe taxi drives out of the city, then along the dusty highway. I stuff my big, empty backpack under the seat and slump against the window.\nReally, I\u2019m not running away from anything earth-shattering. My graduation from college is going to be delayed a year. I broke up with my girlfriend. On top of that, I\u2019m feeling a touch of ennui, leaving me unable to take interest in anything. The last one scares me a bit, but other than that, there\u2019s nothing big. I\u2019m not given to drama.\nMom approved. Find someplace to fix up your spirits, she told me, and come back ready for another go. She thought I was really tormented, which wasn\u2019t true. There\u2019s no way I could get her to understand that, though.\nMy grandmother\u2019s little two-story bungalow sits at the foot of the mountain, its red roof hidden in the dense treetops.\nA small chalkboard hangs from the wooden door. Written on it is: \u201cZhanzhan, I\u2019ve gone shopping. The door is unlocked, so come in on your own when you arrive. There\u2019s food in the fridge.\u201d\nI try pulling on the door handle, but it doesn\u2019t budge. It doesn\u2019t turn either, even when I twist harder. I can only sit on the steps and wait.\nGrandma\u2019s getting muddle-minded with age, I think. She must have locked the door by habit when she left, then forgot about it.\nGrandpa passed away early. My grandmother\u2019s lived here ever since she retired. Mom and Dad wanted to buy her a house in the city, but she turned down all their offers. She said she was used to living alone, as she pleased. She disliked the noise and clamor of the city.\nFor all her life, Grandma was a college professor; her mind and body were still sound. So Dad agreed. We keep saying we\u2019ll spend a holiday here, but either Dad would be busy, or I\u2019d have something planned with my schoolmates and couldn\u2019t cancel.\nI hope Grandma can still take care of herself on her own here, I think to myself, sitting on the steps.\nGrandmother finally returns in the evening, quickening her strides when she sees me in the distance. She smiles at me. \u201cZhanzhan, when did you arrive? Why didn\u2019t you go in the house?\u201d\nI dust off my butt and stand up. Grandma walks up the steps, shifts all her bags to her right hand, and pushes the door with her left hand, on the side closer to the hinges\u2014opposite from the handle. Just like that, the door swings open, no fuss. Grandma walks in first, holding the door open for me.\nMy face flushes a little. I hurry in after her. It looks like I was overthinking things earlier.\nNight descends. Night in the countryside is quiet and tranquil, just the dance of tree shadows cast by the moon.\nGrandma quickly prepares dinner. The rich fragrance of beef fills the small house. After a long day of travel, the smell makes me ravenous.\n\u201cZhanzhan, bring me the mayonnaise in the kitchen, please.\u201d Grandma carefully sets a tureen of steamed eggs with mushroom on the table.\nMy grandmother\u2019s kitchen is spacious and decorated in soft colors. Soup simmers on the stove, wreathed in steam.\nI pull open the fridge, only to get a shock: inside of the fridge is a baking tray, and the inner walls glow red with heat. A row of apple pastries are crisping on the tray. The sweet smell of butter and honey assaults my face.\nTurns out this is the oven. I hurriedly push it shut.\nWhere\u2019s the fridge, then? I turn around. There\u2019s a glass-windowed metal door under the stove\u2014I assumed that was the oven. I walk over and pull it open, and discover that it\u2019s a dishwasher.\nSo I pull open the dishwasher, and find that it\u2019s a water purifier; pull open the water purifier, and find that it\u2019s a trash can; open the trash can, and find that it\u2019s filled with a broad selection of CDs, neatly sorted.\nFinally I realize that the \u201cheating unit\u201d under the window\u2014I thought it looked like a radiator in its ridged casing\u2014is, in fact, the fridge. I locate the mayonnaise, and make sure to open the lid and sniff it, just to make sure the jar doesn\u2019t actually contain condensed milk. Only after I\u2019ve checked do I return to the dining room.\nGrandma already has bowls and chopsticks set out. The instant I sit down I start stuffing my face.\nB\nI spend the next few days furiously learning how to identify everything.\nAlmost nothing in Grandma\u2019s house has a function that matches what you\u2019d expect from the form. The coffeepot is a penholder, the penholder is a lighter, the lighter is a flashlight, the flashlight is a jam container.\nThat last one gives me trouble. It\u2019s the middle of the night when I get up to go to the bathroom. I unthinkingly grab the \u201cflashlight\u201d in the living room, only to get a handful of jam. In the darkness, the wet stickiness on my hand scares the sleep right out of me. When the realization dawns, my first instinct is to get a tissue, but the tissue box is filled with white sugar. I reach for the lamp. Who could have guessed that the table lamp is fake, and that the switch is actually a mousetrap?\nWith a sharp pa, I find myself in an awkward situation. On my left hand is jam dipped in white sugar. On my right hand is a table lamp smeared with cheese.\n\u201cGrandma!\u201d I call softly, but don\u2019t hear a reply. I can only climb the stairs, keeping both hands lifted in front of me. Her bedroom is dark, but yellow-orange light seeps from a small room at the end of the hallway.\n\u201cGrandma?\u201d I try, outside of the room.\nFollowing muffled scrapes of table and chair, Grandma appears at the door. She looks me over and bursts right into laughter. \u201cCome with me,\u201d she says.\nThe room turns out to be much larger than I thought. The lights are bright, and it takes my eyes a moment to adjust. Only then do I see that this is a lab.\nGrandma takes an oddly-shaped little key from a drawer and frees me from the table-lamp-mousetrap. I lick my fingers. The cheese still smells delicious.\n\u201cWhy are you doing experiments this late in the night?\u201d I can\u2019t help but ask.\n\u201cWith bacterial colony growth, I have to take observations every hour.\u201d Smiling, Grandma leads me over to a milk-colored countertop. A neat row of round Petri dishes lie on the counter, each filled with a translucent substance that looks like medicinal cream.\n\u201cIs this . . . nutrient agar?\u201d I\u2019ve done similar experiments at school.\nGrandma nods. \u201cI\u2019m observing the movement of transposons in the bacteria.\u201d\n\u201cTransposons?\u201d\nGrandma opens one of the Petri dishes on her end. She hefts it in her hand and says, \u201cThey\u2019re pieces of DNA capable of encoding reverse transcription enzyme, which allows them to migrate along DNA, breaking away or re-integrating themselves. I want to use them to insert synthetic genes for drug resistance.\u201d\nGrandma sets the lid back on. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it will work. This Petri dish is exposed to the air, providing a low-humidity environment. The one next to it is submerged in a sugar solution. The one after that has been enriched with extra ATP.\u201d\nI follow her example and open the Petri dish closest to me. \u201cWhat are the conditions in this one?\u201d\nI dab my cheese-covered fingertip on the agar. I know that having plenty of nutrients makes cells reproduce faster, which should speed up the genetic integration.\n\u201cZhanzhan!\u201d Grandma hesitates, then says, \u201cThat\u2019s the control sample. It\u2019s not supposed to have any added factors.\u201d\nI\u2019m always like that, full of assumptions when I do things, and careless ones at that.\nOne time, when Jingjing and I fought, she said that I always went about things impulsively, inconsiderately, immaturely. She\u2019s right, I think. She was complaining about the way I always forgot to call her, but I know my problem goes further than that. Jingjing\u2019s a person with lots of plans, and the capability to carry out each one of them reliably, but I\u2019m the total opposite. When I try to carry out my plans, they always go wrong, as sure as bread lands butter-side down.\nWithout a control, Grandma will have to redo the whole experiment. She can keep observing, technically, but at the least she wouldn\u2019t be able to use it in proper published results.\nI\u2019m panicked, unsure of what I should do, but Grandma doesn\u2019t seem to be angry at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d Grandma says. \u201cI could use a sample with added cholesterol anyway.\u201d\nAnd Grandma really does take out a marker pen, makes a note on the lid, and keeps on observing.\nC\nThe next morning, Grandma makes sweet osmanthus flower porridge. The morning sun is lovely shining down on the countryside. The only sound for miles around is birdsong.\nGrandma asks me if I have any plans for these few days. None, I say. That\u2019s the truth. The only thing I might want to do is think about what I might want to do.\n\u201cYour mother says your graduation was delayed because of English, but I don\u2019t see how that could be the case. Weren\u2019t you an English major before you switched? You should be quite good at English.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t test past the fourth level,\u201d I mumble. \u201cI forgot to register in junior year, and this year I forgot the test date.\u201d\nI gulp down the porridge with my head lowered, and stuff up my mouth with a sandwich.\nI\u2019m not afraid of any English exams, no, but that might have been why I failed to take them seriously. As for my change in major, that\u2019s starting to look like another mistake. I switched to environmental studies, only to discover I didn\u2019t care that much about the environment. Then I fled to hardware engineering in junior year, and attended a year\u2019s worth of biology too. The result was today: I was jack of all majors, master of none.\nGrandma cuts me another half slice of bacon. \u201cWhat did your mother say before you came?\u201d\n\u201cNothing in particular. She just wants me to take a breather here, and read some books on economics if I have the time.\u201d\n\u201cYour mother wants you to study economics?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, she says that no matter what company I end up working for, knowing a bit of economics will come in handy.\u201d\nMy mom thinks that I should set a target, then study whatever I needed to get there. But I was lacking in precisely that department. None of the big goals I set ever lasted more than a few days before I nixed them, which left me without any impetus to work on the tasks at hand.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry too much about the future.\u201d Seeing that I\u2019ve finished eating, Grandma begins to clear the table. \u201cJust like the nose didn\u2019t evolve to prop up glasses.\u201d\nJingjing told me the same thing. \u201cThe nose evolved for the purpose of breathing,\u201d she said. God sculpted us all into our own unique forms, so we shouldn\u2019t worry about what other people thought, and stand firm on who we were. So Jingjing left the country, in accordance to who she was. But I was missing that sense of unique purpose too. God never got around to telling me who I was.\nMy mind is elsewhere as I help clear the table. The leftover porridge splatters all over the floor. My face immediately heats.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Grandma takes the pot from me and fetches a mop.\n\u201c . . . It\u2019s flowed into the corner. Won\u2019t that be hard to mop up? Do you have a cloth for cleaning the floor? I\u2019ll do it,\u201d I say, embarrassed.\nI think of the way Mom would crouch and meticulously wipe down the crevice where the floor met the wall. Our house was always squeaky clean. Mom hated nothing more than my brand of haphazardness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really.\u201d Grandma mops up the center of the dining room. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave the corner as is.\u201d\nShe notices that I\u2019m at a loss. \u201cI\u2019m accident-prone myself,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI spill things everywhere. That\u2019s why I laid down culture medium for growing fungi next to the walls. This way I\u2019ll have material for my experiments.\u201d\nI bend down to look by the wall. There really is a band of pale green fuzz stretching around the room. From a distance, it looked like decorative trimming along the perimeter of the floor.\n\u201cSweet porridge is ideal, actually. We might even get mushrooms.\u201d\nShe sees that I\u2019m still awkwardly standing in place, so she adds, \u201cHow about this? If you don\u2019t have anything in particular to do these few days, do you want to help me grow fungi?\u201d\nI nod without hesitation.\nIt\u2019s not just because I want to make up for the mess I made. More than that, I feel I need to change how I spend my days. Up until now, my life has been incoherent and scattershot. I haven\u2019t been able to commit to any one of the well-trodden paths in life, or chart my own course. Maybe what I need is opportunity, even accidentally.\nD\nGrandma likes to say that purpose comes afterward.\nGrandma rejects any form of teleology, from animism to vitalism. She doesn\u2019t believe that evolution has a destination and dislikes explanations like \u201ceyes grew eyelashes to keep dust out.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even think cells evolved membranes for self-protection.\n\u201cThe enclosing membrane came before the cell could exist,\u201d Grandmother says. \u201cSame with G protein-coupled receptors. It became light-sensitive rhodopsin in the eyes and olfactory receptors in the nose.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sort of Darwinism, I suppose: first mutation, then selection. First the protein, then the chemical reaction in which to participate. First the ability to encode an enzyme, then the sensory organ that uses the enzyme.\nExistence precedes essence, I think the saying goes?\nA few evenings later, good news comes from Grandma\u2019s lab: the NTL reagent stain finally reveals the protein we\u2019re looking for in the cytoplasm. A molecular weight test with the centrifuge confirms this. The transposons have successfully reverse transcribed their payload.\nAfter several days of continuous pursuit and observation, you let out a breath at that kind of result. As I help Grandma clean up the lab, I ask, \u201cWhat gene were we inserting, anyway?\u201d\n\u201cA cell suicide signal,\u201d Grandma says placidly.\n\u201cWait, what?\u201d\nGrandma bends to sweep up the bits and pieces under the experiment counter. \u201cThis experiment was primarily meant as cancer treatment research. Cancer cells are simply cells that don\u2019t die when they should, as you know.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d I pick up the dustpan. \u201cDoes that mean you can apply for a patent now?\u201d\nGrandma shakes her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that yet.\u201d\n\u201cHow come?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this kind of reverse transcription might have delayed side effects.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nGrandma doesn\u2019t immediately answer. She collects the test tubes and wipes the counter clean. I tie up the trash bag and follow her downstairs to the garden.\n\u201cI suppose you haven\u2019t heard the hypothesis of how viruses evolved? Transposons promote genetic recombination inside a cell, but on the loose outside of the cell, they can become viruses, like HIV.\u201d\nThe summer breeze is warm and dry, but I involuntarily shiver.\nSo viruses split off from cells themselves. It makes me think of the square root calculator turned execution device in Wang Xiaobo\u2019s book. There\u2019s the same dark humor to it.\nI understand Grandma\u2019s attitude, but I can\u2019t help but feel a little dissatisfied deep down. \u201cStill, this technology could cure cancer. Aren\u2019t you afraid someone will beat you to the patent?\u201d\nGrandma shakes her head. \u201cWhat does that matter?\u201d\nPeng. At that moment, a thump comes from the other side of the garden.\nGrandma and I hurry over, only to see a pudgy, sweaty face emerge from the other side of the garden fence, among the climbing roses.\n\u201cHello . . . I\u2019m terribly sorry, I was trying to rearrange my flower rack, but my hand slipped, and I smashed up your flowers by accident.\u201d\nI look down. He dropped a container of chrysanthemums, the flowerpot lying in pieces. Underneath are Grandma\u2019s azaleas, an equally gory sight.\n\u201cOh, right, I just moved here. I\u2019ll be your neighbor from now on.\u201d The fat middle-aged guy is nodding on autopilot. \u201cI really am very sorry, ma\u2019am. It\u2019s my first day here and I\u2019ve already given you trouble.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d Grandma smiles genially.\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. I\u2019ll bring you flowers tomorrow to replace it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal, really. I can take the opportunity to extract some chloroplasts and anthocyanin from the leaves and flowers. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d Grandma bends down as she speaks and starts picking up flowerpot shards.\nI stand in the yard, the summer night cool around me. My mind is a jumble.\nI\u2019ve discovered that Grandma\u2019s catchphrase is \u201cit\u2019s no big deal.\u201d It might be that most things in Grandma\u2019s eyes really are no big deal. Fame, influence, personal property\u2014none of them matter much at Grandma\u2019s point in life, admittedly. She does whatever she feels like, and to her, it\u2019s enough.\nBut what about me? I think.\nWhat am I going to do once the summer\u2019s over? Return to school, everything the same as before, and meander around for another year until graduation?\nI know that\u2019s not what I want.\nE\nWhen next morning comes around, I help Grandma take care of the shattered flowers, extracting the chlorophyll with acetone. With that, Grandma enthusiastically adds a new member to her enormous team of test subjects.\nI spend the entire morning mentally battling with myself. Close to noon, I finally make my choice. No matter what, I think, I should first go to the patent office and ask a few questions. Conveniently, the guy next door comes over in the afternoon to make amends. I take the opportunity to run off on my own.\nThe website gave clear directions to the patent office, and I find it easily. The four-story building is plain but stately, the lobby quiet and well-lit. A graceful, pretty girl sits behind the receptionist\u2019s desk, reading a book.\n\u201cH-hello, I\u2019d like to apply for a patent.\u201d\nShe looks up and smiles. \u201cHello. Fill out the form over there, please. What are you patenting?\u201d\n\u201cUh, an anti-cancer biological factor.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll want to head to Hall 3, the Biology and Chemistry Office.\u201d She points toward the right. As I turn, she muses to herself, \u201cStrange, why are there so many people applying for anti-cancer factors today?\u201d\nI spin right back around. \u201cWait, there was someone else before me?\u201d\n\u201cYes, an older man came just this morning.\u201d\nMy heart lurches. I sense something\u2019s not quite right.\n\u201cDo you know what technology he was patenting, specifically?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cWas it a drug, or something else?\u201d\nThe girl sighs. \u201cI\u2019m just a college student working here for the summer. It\u2019s not my business to look at the applications. You should go in and ask yourself.\u201d With that, the girl lowers her head once more and resumes scribbling and underlining.\nI bend over to look. It\u2019s a book of English vocabulary. \u201cYou\u2019re memorizing vocabulary?\u201d I ask, trying to get her on my side. \u201cI\u2019m doing that too.\u201d\n\u201cOh? You\u2019re a college student?\u201d She raises her head and looks me over curiously. \u201cAnd you already have something to patent? That\u2019s impressive.\u201d\n\u201cAh . . . no, you\u2019ve got it wrong.\u201d My face flushes a little. \u201cI\u2019m just looking in on behalf of my academic advisor. Do you remember what that older guy looked like? I think my advisor might have come here already without telling me.\u201d\n\u201cHmm . . . he was short, on the plump side, kind of bald. I think he was wearing a yellow jacket. I don\u2019t remember anything else.\u201d\nLike I suspected. No wonder I noticed something was off when I left the house.\nThe middle-aged guy next door arrived with his flowers just then. I took the flowerpot from him, and when he went to open the door for me, he pushed on the side of the door closer to the hinges without hesitation. Someone here for the first time wouldn\u2019t have known to do that. I understand now. Last night wasn\u2019t purely chance. He must have accidentally knocked over the flowers while eavesdropping.\nHe really has no sense of decency, coming over again today, I think. I need to hurry and tell Grandma. He probably thought that we wouldn\u2019t be applying for a patent and would never find out. Good thing I came here.\n\u201cLeaving already?\u201d the girl calls out as I head for the door. \u201cHere\u2019s a pamphlet, then. It has an introduction to the patent office and an explanation of the application process, plus contact information.\u201d\nI manage a smile. I accept the pamphlet, stick it in my pocket, and stride quickly out the door.\nF\nI rush home only to find Grandma in her lab like usual, calmly looking through her microscope. She\u2019s a quiet, steady island amid a chaos of river torrents.\n\u201cGrandma . . . \u201d I force my panting and puffing under control. \u201cHe stole your Petri dishes . . . \u201d\n\u201cBack from somewhere? Where did you go, to end up so dusty?\u201d Grandma looks up, smiling, and brushes at my jacket.\n\u201cI went\u2014\u201d I fall silent, unsure of how to explain my trip to the patent office. I change tack. \u201cGrandma, that fat guy next door stole your Petri dishes and applied for a patent.\u201d\nUnexpectedly, Grandma only smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. I can continue my research just fine. Moreover, like I told you, the experiment we conducted was very crude and preliminary. The results can\u2019t be put into application as they are.\u201d\nI look at Grandma, at a loss for words. Is it actually possible for someone to be so easygoing? Grandma doesn\u2019t seem to concern herself with things like intellectual property and monetary gain at all. I silently take the pamphlet out of my pocket and hold it in my hands, folding and unfolding it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that for now. First come and look at this.\u201d Grandma points to the microscope in front of her.\nI take a halfhearted peep through it. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask, offhandedly.\n\u201cGenetically engineered photosynthesizing bacteria.\u201d\nI perk up. This sounds interesting. \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d\n\u201cI simply reverse transcribed genes from the chloroplasts into the bacteria. They\u2019ve already expressed many of the proteins, although I\u2019m sure there are still problems present. If we can overcome them, maybe these bacteria can be used as a source of alternative energy.\u201d\nAs I listen to Grandma\u2019s placid, happy voice, I suddenly get a strange and dreamlike feeling. It\u2019s like I\u2019m cocooned in a layer of fog, while her voice is coming from a long distance away. I look down. I\u2019m rubbing the pamphlet between my fingers. I need to make a choice.\nGrandma\u2019s still talking. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve laid down a lot of culture medium on the floors. I plan to replace more material so I can grow the bacteria all over the house. If it works, we\u2019ll have a use for porridge leftovers and everything. As for the actual electricity generation, you were the one who gave me the inspiration. Cell membranes normally have high fluidity, which makes it difficult to capture the high-energy electrons generated from photosynthesis. However, if we add large quantities of cholesterol molecules, we can just about stabilize the membrane. In theory, we can use micro-electrodes to position . . . \u201d\nI stand there woodenly. I\u2019m not really paying attention to Grandma, just catching fragments here and there. This discovery might have even bigger future applications. But my brain is a worse jumble than before. I can\u2019t concentrate enough to listen anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re bringing up all the things I did wrong,\u201d I say awkwardly.\nGrandma shakes her head. \u201cZhanzhan, do you still not understand?\u201d She stops, looking into my eyes. \u201cEvery day, every moment, countless random events will occur. You\u2019ll pick one of many possible restaurants to eat at, take one of many possible buses, see one of many possible advertisements. And at that point in time, you can\u2019t classify them as good or bad, right or wrong. They take on worth only in the future. What we do at this moment in the present gives meaning to another moment in the past . . . \u201d\nGrandma\u2019s voice sounds light and drifting. I can\u2019t react to it in time. Chance, time, meaning, future, the words spin in my head. I think of Borges\u2019, \u201cThe Garden of Forking Paths.\u201d Yu Tsun must have felt what I\u2019m feeling, the decision uncertain but fomenting in my heart, even as enigmatic words wisp into my ear . . .\n\u201c . . . biology is based on just one set of principles: random events and directional selection. What\u2019s doing the selection? What allows some events to stick around and prove to be beneficial? The answer is perpetuation alone. If a protein can persist, it will persist. It will claim a position in the course of history, while other proteins appear and then disappear at random. The only way to make a step you\u2019ve taken \u2018correct\u2019 is to take another step in the same direction . . . \u201d\nI think of myself, of the fat guy next door, of Mom and Jingjing, of the four years I spent in a muddle, of my dejection and conflict, of the bright and shining lobby of the patent office. I know I need an opportunity.\n\u201c . . . that\u2019s why, if we can make use of them, cheese and spilled porridge and broken-off flowers don\u2019t have to be bad things at all.\u201d\nAnd I make my choice.\nG\nAfter that summer, I get an internship at the patent office. I learned of the opportunity from the booklet.\nIt\u2019s not very easy to find a proper job here, but they\u2019re always looking for college students to take care of odds and ends\u2014fortunate, that I haven\u2019t graduated yet. The work at the patent office isn\u2019t hard, but it requires a bit of knowledge from every field\u2014fortunate, that I was so aimless in my studies at college.\nAn\u2019an\u2014the girl I met the first time I came here\u2014is now my girlfriend. We fell in love while studying together for the English exam\u2014fortunate, that I hadn\u2019t passed the fourth level. An\u2019an says that I seemed polite and shy on first impression, which she found charming\u2014I didn\u2019t tell her that it was due to nervousness and a guilty conscience. Everything seems to have worked out like magic. Even the things I felt bad about ended up helping me.\nTaking it a step further, I can even say that my inner turmoil was a good thing\u2014if it weren\u2019t for that, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to Grandma\u2019s house, and everything that came after wouldn\u2019t have happened. Looking back, everything from before was all linked together into one chain.\nI know that no one planned this for me. Fate doesn\u2019t exist. I chose all of it.\nIt\u2019s a strange feeling. We always think we can choose our futures, but that\u2019s not true. What we really can choose is our past.\nI chose the lunch I had a couple of years ago, made it a lunch different from the thousand other possible lunches. Likewise, I chose whether my time at college was a mistake.\nMaybe accepting reality is just another name for staying true to yourself. Who are you, really, other than the sum of everything that\u2019s happened?\nA year has passed. With a happy mindset, I\u2019ve done great at my work. The patent office has accepted me as a full-time employee. I\u2019ll start my job in the fall.\nI like it here. I like learning bits and pieces from all sorts of subjects. Besides, I\u2019m no good at making long-term plans, or carrying them out. The work here is just one case after another, no need for looking far ahead. Plus, I have the same job as Einstein, which is pretty awesome.\nAfter a year of repeated experiments and observations, Grandma is applying for patents for her anti-cancer factor and photosynthesizing walls. Several large companies have already expressed interest. Grandma isn\u2019t interested in contract negotiations, so I\u2019ve taken on the responsibilities of a middleman. Fortunate, that I work for the patent office.\nOh, right, I forgot to mention. The fat guy next door didn\u2019t steal the Petri dishes with the anti-cancer factors after all. He thought he found the incubator, but it was actually an ordinary wardrobe. The real incubator looks like a dresser.\nSo you never know what something\u2019s really meant for, Grandma says. Turns out she knew from the beginning. Turns out she knew everything from the beginning.\nOriginally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, 2007.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nBorn in 1984 in Tianjin, Hao Jingfang graduated in 2006 from the Tsinghua University, majoring in physics.

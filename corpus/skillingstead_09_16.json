Inevitably her steps brought her to Destiny. The lander stood in a field of high grass, the last unnatural thing on 51 PegesiD. Of course, the dying man would say Allegra herself must stop challenging the natural order. Wind moved the grass in purple waves, and Allegra could almost imagine it was an ocean and Destiny a sea-faring vessel that might carry her away, instead of a spaceship deliberately disabled.\nAllegra sat on a hill overlooking the field, already out of breath after her short walk. 51 PegesiD\u2019s lower oxygen combined with the planet\u2019s greater density turned Allegra into a wheezing and stooped old woman\u2014at the age of seventeen! It wasn\u2019t fair. The dying man called the planet Gaia. He called it \u201cunspoiled.\u201d He called it \u201cparadise.\u201d And he had marooned them there forever.\nA flying reptile, about the size of a kitten, beat into the air. The reptiles were harmless, but their shit stank and was everywhere. Gaia wasn\u2019t paradise to Allegra; it was prison.\nAnd the dying man was Allegra\u2019s father.\nThe wind carried the scent of wild flowers. She was not allowed to name the flowers, or catalog them, though back home she had been studying to become an exobotanist. 51 PegesiD\u2019s unofficial name might have been Gaia, but that\u2019s where the naming of things stopped. \u201cThere is no ownership here,\u201d her father said. \u201cEither we are in perfect harmony or we are despoilers from outside the body of the planet. A disease infection. Part of the human cancer that ravages worlds, starting with our own.\u201d\nHad the scent of alien flowers unraveled her father\u2019s mind? Molecular compounds, incompatible with sanity, carried on the wind? That Allegra wanted to investigate the possibility already invalidated the premise. She breathed the same air, and she still believed in science. Her father\u2019s mind must have harbored delusions even before they departed Centari for the unknown, or, as he told her when she woke from stasis, an \u201cunspoiled haven.\u201d\nAllegra almost had her breath back. She stood up slowly\u2014and froze. The wind carried something besides the flowered scent. Tiny voices, as if invisible insects in the grass were speaking.\nThe voices were coming from Destiny.\nShe ran, gasping, down the hillside. Her knees ached with every jolting footfall. The hatch stood open, as it had for three months, ever since her father marooned them here. She pulled herself up the steps. The voices had stopped, and she wondered if she had imagined them; Allegra was desperate for other voices.\nThe natural world had infiltrated the body of the ship. Beetle-like insects crawled on polished surfaces. Something had made a nest under one of the acceleration couches, an untidy bundle of purple grass. And despite the open hatch, the cabin smelled so bad of flying reptile shit she wanted to gag.\nIn the gloom, a white light glowed on the communication console. Allegra stared at it, and the voice spoke.\nHer father\u2019s voice.\n\u201cMaintain thirty degree downslope on a relative heading of two-four-zero.\u201d\nA recording?\nAllegra slumped. She leaned heavily on the console, breathing hard. The planet pulling her down, always pulling her down. Then another voice spoke. Allegra raised her chin. A man, speaking crisply, focused.\n\u201cConfirmed. Following your vector, Destiny.\u201d\nNot a recording. The lander\u2019s rudimentary AI, a reactive voice capable of simple back-and-forth, had been reprogrammed with her father\u2019s voice and was conversing with someone. The someone probably didn\u2019t know what he was talking to.\nAllegra touched the microphone key. \u201cHello, hello? Pilot, this is Destiny. Do you copy?\u201d\nNothing.\nThen: \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d A violent rattling, mechanical disturbance, and the voice was gone.\nAllegra leaned into the mike. \u201cPilot, what\u2019s happening? Talk to me. Please.\u201d\nDead air.\nAllegra hunkered and pried off the access panel under the communications display. She unzipped the hip pocket of her flight suit and produced her forbidden halogen light. Her father had declared all technology an affront to Gaia (except, apparently, when it served to misdirect this pilot), but Allegra had kept the light anyway. And she continued to wear her flight suit, despite his insistence she \u201cclothe herself properly, in harmony.\u201d He couldn\u2019t just tell her what to do, couldn\u2019t take everything away from her. She should have listened to her mother when she told Allegra that her father wasn\u2019t entirely rational anymore. Now she would never see her mother again, unless this pilot . . .\nThere: an interrupted circuit preventing live communication out of the lander. She rigged a cross patch and tried the mike again.\n\u201cDestiny calling unidentified pilot, Destiny calling unidentified pilot. Are you there?\u201d\nShe waited, received only dead air. Had something gone wrong with her patch? That anything was functional on the Destiny lander was a revelation to Allegra. Her father\u2019s sabotage had appeared thorough, rendering the vehicle powerless. But he must have anticipated the possibility of outsiders and prepared this . . . well, whatever this was. A trap?\nThen the voice spoke again, sounding strained. \u201cI\u2019m identified. I identified from orbit.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cAllegra Ray. I\u2019m, we\u2014I\u2019m here with my father. We\u2019re stranded.\u201d\n\u201cWas it your father who talked me down?\u201d\n\u201cOnly in a second-hand way,\u201d Allegra said. \u201cHis voice but my lander\u2019s interactive AI.\u201d\n\u201cWell, whatever it was, it steered me into a hell of a mess.\u201d The pilot sounded angry\u2014and in pain.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your situation?\u201d\n\u201cNot wonderful. Crashed. Pretty banged up\u2014the ship and me both. I might have to charge you for repairs, Allegra Ray.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m good for it. Who are you anyway?\u201d\n\u201cMalik. Deep space survey, private contractor. Found your orbital frame. There\u2019s not supposed to be anyone out this far, so it was a surprise.\u201d Malik groaned.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cTold you. Banged up.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Anyhow, I started receiving transmissions from the surface. Guy said his ship was disabled and could I help. Naturally I followed the landing instructions. I was going to be the hero, rescue the castaway and all that. Instead I flew into some nasty geothermal venting. My shuttle\u2019s small. Struck me like a disrupter blast, flipped me. When I came to, you were talking. Oh, God. Wow. That hurts.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your location?\u201d\nAfter a long rasping pause, Malik said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cI heard the last relative heading, but I don\u2019t know what it was relative to. Can\u2019t you check your nav history?\u201d\nAnother long pause. \u201cCan\u2019t get to it, or anything else. Hurt bad. Broken legs. Pinned against the bulkhead.\u201d\nAllegra closed her eyes, feeling more pulled down than ever. \u201cYou could be anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m right here, where the pain is. If you\u2019ve got a medbot handy bring it along. Look, I might pass out.\u201d\n\u201cHang on, Malik. I\u2019ll figure out where you are. Hello? Malik?\u201d\nIt took a while, but she managed to unlock the lander\u2019s recorded conversation and tracking data. Destiny might never fly again (her father had dumped the fuel and severed control linkages) but it still had a functional mind. Before hearing the distant insect voices from the hilltop, she hadn\u2019t realized that anything on the vehicle was still working. Her father\u2019s sabotage was both technically intricate and mad.\n\u201cThere was no voice,\u201d her father said.\nInside the yurt, the light was dim. Her father had constructed the shelter with sloppy enthusiasm, even as he was becoming ill and Allegra was still refusing to accept their marooned status. Now he lay on a bed of reeds padded with big fibrous leaves that Allegra called \u201celephant ears.\u201d He wore a kind of Tarzan loin cloth made of the same leaves. With the advent of his illness and frequent fevers, he had lost so much weight that his body resembled a hide-and-bone doll. His watery eyes, sunken and bright with fever, watched Allegra.\nHer heart ached\u2014with anger and pity. If only he hadn\u2019t eaten the indigenous plants without testing them. How could a mind so brilliant also be so irrational? Allegra had subsisted on the ship\u2019s stores for as long as she could. Then, against her father\u2019s insistence that they abandon \u201cthe tools of the despoilers,\u201d she\u2019d retrieved a testing kit from the lander and used it to figure out what she could safely eat. The answer was: not much. And what she did consume, ate her as much as she ate it, turning her gut biome into a volatile experiment\u2014even with pills from the emergency survival kit that were intended to mitigate such reactions. All her father said was, \u201cIf we trust Gaia, she will welcome us.\u201d\nNot so much.\n\u201cDad, I heard him. On the radio. I talked to him.\u201d\n\u201cI told you to stay away from the lander.\u201d\nHer anger surged, and she held it down. \u201cThe pilot was following a heading the AI gave him. A heading you gave him. You made him crash. I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d\nHis head rolled side-to-side, making the dried-out elephant ears crackle softly. \u201cThere\u2019s only us, sweetheart. I saved you from the despoilers, if only you could see that. Gaia is\u2014\u201d\nHer frustration boiled over. \u201cPegesiD is killing you.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cShe knows we don\u2019t trust her.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe. You and I are the same flesh. She knows that.\u201d He plucked weakly at the leg of her flight suit. \u201cYou defy her even in what you chose to wear.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t put it on me. Please, don\u2019t.\u201d\nHe closed his eyes. \u201cI knew they would come, the despoilers. I prepared.\u201d\nIn a fading voice, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me.\u201d\nWhy not? You left us. Then came back to \u201crescue\u201d me from the big bad human race. But humans weren\u2019t a disease infecting the universe. They made it matter by observing it\u2014that\u2019s what Allegra\u2019s mother, a physicist, said. That was the whole point. So what if humans also made messes? You could clean up a mess and learn not to make the same one over again. Her father had made a mess, too, but he wasn\u2019t cleaning it up. He was making it worse. He wanted to disappear into nature, but it was nature that disappeared, without humans to observe it.\nShe put the back of her hand to his forehead. His damp skin radiated heat. On the orbital frame, where she had access to medical equipment, she might be able to help him. But without a functioning ship, the orbital was out of reach. Malik had a ship. Was it flyable after the crash? She had to find out. But she was torn.\nDon\u2019t leave me.\nAllegra sat on the ground beside her father. He had lied to her, brought her here, took away her life. But he was still her father. Sometimes the good memories seemed farther away than Centari, than Earth, even. But she still saw them (Daddy, pick me up, pick me up now!) and so they still mattered.\nShe stared at the ground. The planet pulled at her, like hands reaching from a grave to drag her down. But it was only gravity\u2014as indifferent to her presence as the ocean she nearly drowned in back on CentauriBd. She had steered her windboard into a squall. Breaking waves tumbled her into the sea, and she had struggled to keep her head above water until she could regain the board. It had been like fighting a living thing, a thing with intentional malice. In the midst of drowning, that was how it felt. Her father believed Gaia did things intentionally. At least Allegra understood her own misperception. But she hadn\u2019t gone back in the water and never would. The fear of drowning filled her with dread, as did the fear of her father\u2019s death. Sitting there, she couldn\u2019t do anything\u2014not for her father, or the pilot, or herself.\nAllegra stood up, heavily. She filled two water bottles and clipped them to her flight suit. For a moment, she looked down at her father. Then she turned and ducked out of the yurt, squinting in the setting glare of 51 PegesiD. Don\u2019t leave me, he\u2019d said. But he had left her first, and besides, she was on a mission to save them both.\nShe stopped at the lander and booted the communications rig.\n\u201cMalik, are you there?\u201d\nNothing.\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a medbot, but I\u2019m coming. Malik?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here. Calm down. I\u2019m the one who crashed, remember?\u201d He sounded weak.\n\u201cI remember. What\u2019s your status?\u201d\nHe laughed harshly, started to cough. \u201cStatus? My status is unhappy. If I get out of this, I\u2019m going to clock your old man. Sorry, kid, but he tried to kill me.\u201d\nAllegra winced. \u201cHe\u2019s not himself. And I\u2019m not a kid.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Then all\u2019s forgiven.\u201d He coughed again. \u201cI hurt.\u201d\nThe com went silent. Had he passed out again?\nAllegra opened a locker and retrieved the first-aid kit. It wasn\u2019t a medbot but it was better than nothing. She climbed out of the lander and stood before the sunset. According to her analysis, Malik had come down more than twenty kilometers from the lander. It would take her most of the night to reach the crash site. All around her the purple grass whispered doom\u2014a secret sea that wanted to drown her.\nTwenty kilometers might as well have been a hundred. Plodding through the night, fear and gravity weighed heavily upon her. She stopped to rest, lay flat on the ground, panting. Three small moons made a lunar ellipsis. Out of the dark around her, 51 PegesiD\u2019s fauna huffed and grunted. She was used to the flying lizard-kittens, which made an almost-cute squeaking noise. But these unseen creatures sounded big. Would anyone ever study them, build a taxonomic classification? Or would they remain a pointless mystery that might ignore you\u2014or eat you.\nShe stood up, studied the stars, oriented herself, and resumed walking. An hour before dawn, she saw a light\u2014and wondered what was wrong with it. The light, definitely artificial, shifted, strangely refracted. She lurched toward it, trying to run but incapable, heavy legs stumping like posts. Sweat poured off her. The flight suit clung to her body, chaffing her thighs. She stumbled on disturbed earth, fell heavily, got up and found herself standing in a long track of torn-up landscape\u2014the crash-path of Malik\u2019s shuttle. The path ended at the edge of a deep pond. The shuttle was down there, its blue position lights refracted by the cold, clear water.\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t go into the water. Couldn\u2019t. Allegra clenched her jaw. Had she come all this way for nothing? She looked up. Among the faded stars, two orbiters sped around the planet, empty and waiting for a crew that would never return, while Allegra stood here feeling sorry for herself.\nGaia had won.\nBubbles, trailing up from the shuttle, collected on the surface of the pond. In the pre-dawn light, the outline of Malik\u2019s craft became visible. How damaged was it? If she could get inside she might be able to power it out of the water. Only fear prevented her from trying, from taking the first step. And her fear was like the planet. It only mattered because she was paying attention to it.\n\u201cScrew this.\u201d\nAt the edge of the pond Allegra took deep breaths, heaving oxygen into her lungs, expanding her chest. That time on CentauriBd it hadn\u2019t been the ocean trying to drown her. It had been Allegra making a series of bad choices that ended with her in a drowning panic. But acknowledging the irrational premise of fear and acting against it were two different things. Allegra was already tired. If she went into the water and failed to access the shuttle\u2019s airlock, how would she fight gravity and exhaustion to reach the surface again?\nStop delaying.\nOne last deep breath. She held it and, clutching the first-aid kit, dove into the pond. The water was shockingly cold. She hadn\u2019t expected that. She sank rapidly. As if on its own volition, her body twisted around and tried for the surface. She wasn\u2019t ready! She couldn\u2019t! Gravity acted like lead sash weights tied to her ankles. The surface trembled beyond her fingertips, and she began to sink back, Gaia dragging her down.\nNo! She twisted around again and began pulling and kicking for the bottom with everything she had. In moments she reached the shuttle. Vision blurry, chest aching, she couldn\u2019t find the hatch. She hauled herself frantically around the vehicle. Air bubbled past her lips, her lungs desperate for replenishment. She started to become disoriented\u2014and there it was.\nThe airlock.\nIt was a standard arrangement, similar to Destiny\u2019s. She tore open the hinged cover, revealing the manual control wheel, and started cranking it. If for some reason the inner hatch was already open, she was about to flood the shuttle and kill Malik, if he wasn\u2019t already dead.\nThe outer hatch began to retract. Trapped air exploded out, churning Allegra away from the shuttle. She fought her way back and cranked the wheel until the gap was wide enough to squeeze through.\nThe inner hatch was still air-tight.\nShe closed the outer hatch and slapped the PURGE button. The water level began to drop, and Allegra thrust her face above the surface, gasping and choking. The shuttle wasn\u2019t a submarine. The chamber was designed to equalize atmospheres, not water pressure. The water level drained only as far as Allegra\u2019s knees. The inner hatch rolled open, allowing the remaining pond water in the chamber to sluice into the main cabin. Malik yelled, \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d and Allegra dragged herself through the hatchway.\nThe crash impact had ripped the pilot\u2019s seat off its track and pinned Malik against the bulkhead. A knob of bone poked through a tear in the leg of his suit. Allegra grimaced. Malik stared at her through his pain and astonishment. He forced a grim smile.\n\u201cWhat took you so long, kid? And where\u2019d all the water come from?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Will this thing fly?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows?\u201d\nAllegra took in the flight controls and determined them similar enough to Destiny\u2019s that she believed she could handle the ship. She turned to Malik, unsealed the first-aid kit, and selected a needled opioid tab. \u201cFor the pain,\u201d she said and pushed it into his thigh. Malik\u2019s eyes popped wide, then narrowed to dreamy slits.\nNow she would find out. Allegra strapped herself into the second chair, studied the controls, and initiated engine-start. The shuttle trembled, like something coming awake in the cold. Allegra powered up the thrusters. The shuttle jerked out of the mud and rose swiftly. In a moment they were airborne. Allegra banked towards her father\u2019s yurt, her heart aching with anger and regret. Gaia was a fantasy. Allegra would never understand her father, but if she tried, she could at least begin to understand 51 PegesiD.\nThe shuttle\u2019s engines gobbled air in thunderous harmony. Below, creatures like bears with long necks stood up in the grass, craning their heads.\nShe caught only a glimpse.\nIn 2001 Jack Skillingstead submitted a story to Stephen King's \"On Writing\" contest.

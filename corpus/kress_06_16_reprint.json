It warn\u2019t even Chinese.\nI got there afore it opened. I was hoping to get inside afore anybody else came, any neighbors who knew us or busybodies from Blaine. But Carrie Campbell was already parked in her truck, the baby on her lap. We nodded to each other but didn\u2019t speak. The Campbells are better off than us\u2014Dave works in the mine up to Allington\u2014but old Gacy Campbell been feuding with Dr. Harman for decades and Carrie was probably glad to have someplace else to take the baby. He didn\u2019t look good, snuffling and whimpering.\nWhen the doors opened, I went in first, afore Carrie was even out of the truck. It was going to take her a while. She was pregnant again.\n\u201cYes?\u201d said the woman behind the desk. Just a cheap metal desk, which steadied me some. The room was nothing special, just a few chairs, some pictures on the wall, a clothes basket of toys in the corner. What really surprised me was that the woman warn\u2019t Chinese. Blue eyes, brown hair, middle-aged. She looked a bit like Granmama, but she had all her teeth. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\n\u201cI want to see a doctor.\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d She smiled. Yeah, all her teeth. \u201cWhat seems to be the problem, miss?\u201d\n\u201cNo problem.\u201d From someplace in the back another woman came out, this one dressed like a nurse. She warn\u2019t Chinese either.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d the woman behind the desk said. From her accent she warn\u2019t from around here\u2014like I didn\u2019t already know that. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\u201cThen how can I\u2014\u201d\nCarrie waddled into the door, the baby balanced on her belly. Now my visit would be table-talk everywhere. All at once I just wanted to get it over with.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d I said, too loud. \u201cI just want to see a doctor.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cMy name is Ludmilla Connors.\u201d\nThe nurse stopped walking toward Carrie. The woman behind the counter half stood up, then sat down again. She tried to pretend like she hadn\u2019t done it, like she warn\u2019t pleased. If Bobby were that bad a liar, he\u2019d a been in jail even more than he was.\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d the woman said. I didn\u2019t see her do nothing, but a man came out from the back, and he was Chinese. So was the woman who followed him.\n\u201cI\u2019m Ludmilla Connors,\u201d I told him, and I clenched my ass together real hard to keep my legs steady. \u201cAnd I want to volunteer for the experiment. But only if it pays what I heard. Only if.\u201d\nThe woman behind the desk took me back to a room with a table and some chairs and a whole lot of filing cabinets, and she left me there with the Chinese people. I looked at their smooth faces with those slanted, mostly closed eyes, and I wished I hadn\u2019t come. I guess these two were the reason everybody hereabouts called it the \u201cChinese clinic,\u201d even if everybody else there looked like regular Americans.\n\u201cHello, Ms. Connors,\u201d the man said and he spoke English real good, even if it was hard to understand some words. \u201cWe are glad you are here. I am Dr. Dan Chung and this is my chief technician Jenny.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d He didn\u2019t look like no \u201cDan,\u201d and if she was \u201cJenny,\u201d I was a fish.\n\u201cYour mother is Courtney Connors and your father was Robert Connors?\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d\n\u201cWe have family trees for everyone on the mountain. It\u2019s part of our work, you know. You said you want to aid us in this research?\u201d\n\u201cI said I want to get paid.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You will be. You are nineteen.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d It warn\u2019t a question, and I didn\u2019t like that they knew so much about me. \u201cHow much money?\u201d\nHe told me. It warn\u2019t as much as the rumors said, but it was enough. Unless they actually killed me, it was enough. And I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d do that. The government wouldn\u2019t let them do that\u2014not even this stinking government.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cStart the experiment.\u201d\nJenny smiled. I knew that kind of smile, like she was so much better than me. My fists clenched. Dr. Chung said, \u201cJenny, you may leave. Send in Mrs. Cully, please.\u201d\nI liked the surprised look on Jenny\u2019s face, and then the angry look she tried to hide. Bitch.\nMrs. Cully didn\u2019t act like Jenny. She brought in a tray with coffee and cookies: just regular store-bought Pepperidge Farm, not Chinese. Under the tray was a bunch of papers. Mrs. Cully sat down at the table with us.\n\u201cThese are legal papers, Ms. Connors,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cBefore we begin, you must sign them. If you wish, you can take them home to read, or to a lawyer. Or you can sign them here, now. They give us permission to conduct the research, including the surgery. They say that you understand this procedure is experimental. They give the university, myself, and Dr. Liu all rights to information gained from your participation. They say that we do not guarantee any cure, or even any alleviation, of any medical disorder you may have. Do you want to ask questions?\u201d\nI did, but not just yet. Half of me was grateful that he didn\u2019t ask if I can read, the way tourists and social workers sometimes do. I can, but I didn\u2019t understand all the words on this page: indemnify, liability, patent rights. The other half of me resented that he was rushing me so.\nI said something I warn\u2019t intending: \u201cIf Ratface Rollins warn\u2019t president, this clinic wouldn\u2019t be here at all!\u201d\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cBut you Americans elected a Libertarian.\u201d\n\u201cUs Americans? Aren\u2019t you one?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I am a Chinese national, working in the United States on a visa arranged by my university.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know what to say to that, so I grabbed the pen and signed everything. \u201cLet\u2019s get it over with, then.\u201d\nBoth Dr. Chung and Mrs. Cully looked startled. She said, \u201cBut . . . Ludmilla, didn\u2019t you understand that this will take several visits, spread out over months?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I know. And that you\u2019re going to pay me over several months, too, but the first bit today.\u201d\n\u201cYes. After your interview.\u201d\nShe had one of those little recording cubes that I only seen on TV. They can play back an interview like a movie, or they can send the words to a computer to get put on screen. Maybe today would be just talking. That would be fine with me. I took a cookie.\n\u201cInitial interview with experimental subject Ludmilla Connors,\u201d Dr. Chung said, and gave the date and time. \u201cMs. Connors, you are here of your own free will?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you are a member of the Connors family, daughter of Courtney Ames Connors and the late Robert Connors?\u201d\n\u201cDid you know my dad at the hospital? Were you one of his doctors?\u201d\n\u201cNo. But I am familiar with his symptoms and his early death. I am sorry.\u201d\nI warn\u2019t sorry. Dad was a son-of-a-bitch even afore he got sick. Maybe knowing it was coming, that it was in his genes, made him that way, but a little girl don\u2019t care about that. I only cared that he hit me and screamed at me\u2014hit and screamed at everybody until the night he took after Dinah so bad that Bobby shot him. Now Bobby, just four months from finishing doing his time at Luther Luckett, was getting sick, too. I knew I had to tell this foreigner all that, but it was hard. My family don\u2019t ask for help. \u201cWe don\u2019t got much,\u201d Granmama always said, \u201cbut we got our pride.\u201d\nThat, and the Connors curse. Fatal Familial Insomnia.\nIt turned out that Dr. Chung already knew a lot of my story. He knew about Dad, and Bobby, and Mama, and Aunt Carol Ames. He even knew which of the kids got the gene\u2014it\u2019s a 50-50 chance\u2014and which didn\u2019t. The safe ones: Cody, Patty, Arianna, Timothy. The losers: Shawn, Bonnie Jean, and Lewis. And me.\nSo I talked and talked, and the little light on the recording cube glowed green to show it was on, and Mrs. Cully nodded and looked sympathetic so damn much that I started wishing for Jenny back. Dr. Chung at least sat quiet, with no expression on that strange ugly face.\n\u201cAre you showing any symptoms at all, Ms. Connors?\u201d\n\u201cI have some trouble sleeping at night.\u201d\n\u201cDescribe it for me, in as much detail as you can.\u201d\nI did. I knew I was young to start the troubles; Mama was forty-six and Bobby twenty-nine.\n\u201cAnd the others with the FFI gene? Your mother and Robert, Jr. and\u201d\u2014he looked at a paper\u2014\u201cShawn Edmond and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d I said, and it came out harsher than I meant, \u201cI know I got to tell you everything. But I\u2019m not going to talk none about any of my kin, not what they are or aren\u2019t doing. Especially not to a Chinaman.\u201d\nSilence.\nThen Dr. Chung said quietly, \u201cI think, Ms. Connors, that you must not know how offensive that term is. Like \u2018spic\u2019 or \u2018nigger.\u2019\u201d\nI didn\u2019t know. I felt my face grow warm.\nHe said, \u201cI think it\u2019s like \u2018hillbilly\u2019 is to mountain people.\u201d\nMy face got even warmer. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\nBut it warn\u2019t. I\u2019m not the kind to insult people, even Chinese people. I covered my embarrassment with bluster. \u201cCan I ask some questions for a change?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cIs this Chi\u2014did this clinic come to Blaine and start treating people for what ails them, just to get my family\u2019s trust so you all can do these experiments on our brains?\u201d\nThat was the scuttlebutt in town and I expected him to deny it, but instead he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\nMrs. Cully frowned.\nI said, \u201cWhy? Because there are only forty-one families in the whole world with our sickness? Then why build a whole clinic just to get at us? We\u2019re just a handful of folk.\u201d\nHe said gently, \u201cYou know a lot about fatal familial insomnia.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not stupid!\u201d\n\u201cI would never think that for even a moment.\u201d He shifted in his chair and turned off the recorder. \u201cListen, Ms. Connors. It\u2019s true that sufferers from FFI are a very small group. But the condition causes changes in the brain that involve neural pathways which everybody has. Memory is involved, and sleep regulation, and a portion of the brain called the thalamus that processes incoming sensory signals. Our research here is the best single chance to gain information beyond price about those pathways. And since we also hope to arrest FFI, we were able to get funding as a medical clinical trial. Your contribution to this science will be invaluable.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m doing it.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever your reasons, the data will be just as valuable.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you know you got to do it to me fast. Afore the Libertarians lose power.\u201d\nMrs. Cully looked surprised. Why was she still sitting with us? Then I realized: Dr. Chung warn\u2019t supposed to be alone with a young woman. Well, fine by me. But at least he didn\u2019t seem surprised that I sometimes watch the news.\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Rafe Bannerman wins this presidential election, and it certainly looks as if he will, then all the deregulations of the present administration may be reversed.\u201d\n\u201cSo you got to cut into my skull afore then. And afore I get too sick.\u201d I said it nasty, goading him. I don\u2019t know why.\nBut he didn\u2019t push back. \u201cYes, we must install the optogenetic cable as soon as possible. You are a very bright young woman, Ms. Connors.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to butter me up none,\u201d I said.\nBut after he took blood samples and all the rest of it, after we set up a whole series of appointments, after I answered ten million more questions, the Chinaman\u2019s\u2014no, Chinese man\u2019s\u2014words stayed in my head all the long trudge back up the mountain. Not as bright, those words, as the autumn leaves turning the woods to glory, but it was more praise than I\u2019d gotten since I left school. That was something, anyway.\nWhen I got back to the trailer, about noon, nobody wouldn\u2019t speak to me. Carrie must of dropped by. Bobby\u2019s wife, Dinah, sewed on her quilt for the women\u2019s co-op: the Rail Fence pattern in blue and yellow, real pretty. Mama sat smoking and drinking Mountain Dew. Granmama was asleep in her chair by the stove, which barely heated the trailer. It was cold for October and Bobby didn\u2019t dig no highway coal again. The kids were outside playing, Shawn warn\u2019t around, and inside it was silent as the grave.\nI hung my coat on a door hook. \u201cThat quilt\u2019s coming nice, Dinah.\u201d\nNothing.\n\u201cYou need some help, Mama?\u201d\nNothing.\n\u201cThe hell with you all!\u201d I said.\nMama finally spoke. At least today she was making sense. \u201cYou better not let Bobby hear where you been.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it for you all!\u201d I said, but they all went back to pretending I didn\u2019t exist. I grabbed my coat, and stomped back outside.\nNot that I had anyplace to go. And it didn\u2019t matter if I was inside or out; Mama\u2019s words were the last ones anyone spoke to me for two mortal days. They hardly even looked at me, except for scared peeps from the littlest kids and a glare from Bonnie Jean, like nobody except a ten-year-old can glare. It was like I was dead.\nBut half the reason I was doing this was the hope\u2014not strong, but there\u2014that maybe I wouldn\u2019t end up dead, after first raving and thrashing and trying to hurt people and seeing things that warn\u2019t there. Like Dad, like Aunt Carol Ames, like Cousin Jess. And the other half of the reason was to put some decent food on the table for the kids that wouldn\u2019t look at me or speak to me from fear that Bobby would switch them hard. I had hopes of Shawn, who hadn\u2019t been home in a couple of days, out deer hunting with his buddies. Shawn and I always been close, and he was sweeter than Bobby even afore Bobby started showing our sickness. I hoped Shawn would be on my side. I needed somebody.\nBut that night in bed, with Patty on my other side as far away as she could get without actually becoming part of the wall, Bonnie Jean spooned into me. She smelled of apples and little kid. I hugged onto her like I warn\u2019t never going to let go, and I stayed that way all through the long cold night.\n\u201cWe have good news,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cYour optogenetic vectors came out beautifully.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? What does that mean?\u201d I didn\u2019t really care, but my nerves were all standing on end and if I kept him talking, maybe it would distract me some. Or not.\nWe sat in his lab at the Chinese clinic, a squinchy little room all cluttered with computers and papers. No smoking bottles or bubbling tubes like in the movies, though. Maybe those were in another room. There was another Chinese doctor, too, Dr. Liu. Also Jenny, worse luck, but if she was the \u201cchief technician\u201d I guess she had to be around. I kept my back to her. She wore a pretty red shirt that I couldn\u2019t never afford to buy for Patty or Bonnie Jean.\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I said, realized I\u2019d said it afore, and twisted my hands together.\n\u201cIt means we have constructed the bio-organism to go into your brain, from a light-sensitive opsin, a promoter, and a harmless virus. The opsin will be expressed in only those cells that activate the promoter. When light of a specific wavelength hits those cells, they will activate or silence, and we can control that by\u2014Ms. Connors, you can still change your mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenny said, and Dr. Chung shot her a look that could wither skunkweed. I wouldn\u2019t of thought he could look like that.\n\u201cMy mind is changed,\u201d I said. His talking warn\u2019t distracting me, it was just making it all worse. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cShe signed the contracts!\u201d Jenny said.\nI whirled around on my chair to face her. \u201cYou shut up! Nobody warn\u2019t talking to you!\u201d\nJenny got up and stalked out. Dr. Liu made like he would say something, then didn\u2019t. Over her shoulder Jenny said, \u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Morton. Although too bad she didn\u2019t decide that before the operating room was reserved at Johnson Memorial.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, and fled.\nI got home, bone-weary from the walk plus my worst night yet, just as Jimmy Barton\u2019s truck pulled up at the trailer. Jimmy got out, looking grim, then two more boys, carrying Shawn.\nI rushed up. \u201cWhat happened? Did you shoot him?\u201d Everybody knew that Jimmy was the most reckless hunter on the mountain.\n\u201cNaw. We never even got no hunting. He went crazy, is what. So we brought him back.\u201d\n\u201cCrazy how?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how, Ludie,\u201d Jimmy said, looking at me steady. \u201cLike your family does.\u201d\n\u201cBut he\u2019s only seventeen!\u201d\nJimmy didn\u2019t say nothing to that, and the other two started for the trailer with Shawn. He had a purpled jaw where somebody slugged him, and he was out cold on whatever downers they made him take. My gut twisted so hard I almost bent over. Shawn. Seventeen.\nDinah and Patty came rushing out, streaming kids behind them. Dinah was shrieking enough to wake the dead. I looked at Shawn and thought about how it must of been in the hunting camp, him going off the rails and \u201cexpressing\u201d that gene all over the place: shouting from the panic, grabbing his rifle and waving it around, heart pounding like mad, hitting out at anyone who talked sense. Like Bobby had been a few months ago, afore he got even worse. Nobody in my family ever lasted more than seven months after the first panic attack.\nShawn.\nI didn\u2019t even wait to see if Mama was coming out of the trailer, if this was one of the days she could. I went back down the mountain, running as much as I could, gasping and panting, until I got to the Chinese clinic and the only hope I had for Shawn, for me, for all of us.\nDr. Morton turned out to be a woman. While they got the operating room ready at Johnson Memorial in Jackson, I sat with Dr. Chung in a room that was supposed to look cheerful and didn\u2019t. Yellow walls, a view of the parking lot. A nurse had shaved off a square patch on my hair. I stared out at a red Chevy, trying not to think. Dr. Chung said gently, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a complicated procedure, Ms. Connors. Really.\u201d\n\u201cDrilling a hole into my skull isn\u2019t complicated?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Humans have known how to do that part for thousands of years.\u201d\nNews to me. I said, \u201cI forgot a hat.\u201d\n\u201cA hat?\u201d\n\u201cTo cover this bare spot in my hair.\u201d\n\u201cThe first person from your family to visit, I will tell them.\u201d\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to visit.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Then I will get you a hat.\u201d\n\u201cThanks.\u201d And then, surprising myself, \u201cThey don\u2019t want me to do none of this.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said quietly, and without asking what I meant, \u201cI imagine they do not.\u201d\n\u201cThey think you conduct experiments on us like we\u2019re lab animals. Like with the Nazis. Or Frankenstein.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cI think they are . . . unknowing.\u201d It felt like a huge betrayal. Still, I kept on. \u201cEspecially my Granmama.\u201d\n\u201cGrandmothers are often fierce. Mine is.\u201d He made some notes on a tablet, typing and swiping without looking at it.\nI hadn\u2019t thought of him\u2014of any of them\u2014as having a grandmother. I demanded, like that would make this grandmother more solid, \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d\n\u201cChunhua. What is the name of your grandmother?\u201d\n\u201cLudmilla. Like me.\u201d I thought a minute. \u201c\u2018Fierce\u2019 is the right word.\u201d\n\u201cThen we have this in common, yes?\u201d\nBut I warn\u2019t yet ready to give him that much. \u201cI bet my granmama is more fierce than any of your kin.\u201d\nHe smiled, a crinkling of his strange bald face, eyes almost disappearing in folds of smooth skin. \u201cI would\u2014what is it you say, in poker?\u2014\u2018see that bet\u2019 if I could.\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t answer, and his smile disappeared. I said, \u201cWhat did your granmama do that was so fierce?\u201d\n\u201cShe made me study. Hours every day, hours every night. All spring, all summer, all winter. When I refused, she beat me. What does yours do?\u201d\nAll at once I didn\u2019t want to answer. Was beating better or worse? Granmama never touched me, nor any of us. Dr. Chung waited. Finally I said, \u201cShe freezes me. Looks at me like . . . like she wants to make a icy wind in my mind. And then that wind blows, and I can\u2019t get away from it nohow, and then she turns her back on me.\u201d\n\u201cThat is worse.\u201d\n\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d\n\u201cI think so.\u201d\nA long breath went out of me, clearing out my chest. I said, \u201cBobby warn\u2019t always like he is now. He taught me to fish.\u201d\n\u201cDo you like fishing?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d But I liked Bobby teaching me, just the two of us laughing down by the creek, eating the picnic lunch Mama put up for us.\nA nurse, masked and gowned like on TV, came in and said, \u201cWe\u2019re ready.\u201d\nThe last thing I remember was lying on the table, breathing in the knock-out gas, and thinking, Now at least I\u2019m going to get a long deep sleep. Only at the very last minute I panicked some and my hand, strapped to the table, flapped around a bit. Another hand held it, strong and steady. Dr. Chung. I went under.\nWhen I woke, it was in a different hospital room but Dr. Chung was still there, sitting in a chair and working a tablet. He put it down.\n\u201cWelcome back, Ms. Connors. How do you feel?\u201d\nI put my hand to my head. A thick bandage covered part of it. Nothing hurt, but my mouth was dry, my throat was scratchy, and I had a floaty feeling. \u201cWhat do you got me on? Oxycontin?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Steroids to control swelling and a mild pain med. There are only a few nerve receptors in the skull. Tomorrow we will take you back to Blaine. Here.\u201d\nHe handed me a red knit hat.\nAll at once I started to cry. I never cry, but this was so weird\u2014waking up with something foreign in my skull, and feeling rested instead of skitterish and tired, and then this hat from this strange-looking man . . . I sobbed like I was Cody, three years old with a skinned knee. I couldn\u2019t stop sobbing. It was awful.\nDr. Chung didn\u2019t high-tail it out of there. He didn\u2019t try to there-there me, or take my hand, or even look embarrassed and angry mixed together, like every other man I ever knowed when women cry. He just sat and waited, and when I finally got myself to stop, he said, \u201cI wish you would call me \u2018Dan.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Crying had left me embarrassed, if not him. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your name. Is it?\u201d\n\u201cNo. It just seems more comfortable for Westerners.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is your damned name?\u201d\n\u201cIt is Hai. It means \u2018the ocean.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like any ocean.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d He grinned.\n\u201cDo all Chinese names mean something?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I was astonished when I found out American names do not.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was that?\u201d\n\u201cWhen I came here for graduate school.\u201d\nI was talking too much. I never rattled on like this, especially not to Chinese men who had me cut open. It was the damn drugs they gave me, that thing for swelling or the \u201cmild pain med.\u201d I\u2019d always stayed strictly away from even aspirin, \u2019cause of watching Mama and Bobby. Afore I could say anything, Dr. Chung said, \u201cYour meds might induce a little \u2018high,\u2019 Ludmilla. It will pass soon. Meanwhile, you are safe here.\u201d\n\u201cLike hell I am!\u201d\n\u201cYou are. And I apologize for calling you \u2018Ludmilla.\u2019 I have not received permission.\u201d\n\u201cOh, go the fuck ahead. Only it\u2019s \u2018Ludie.\u2019\u201d I felt my skull again. I wanted to rip off the bandage. I wanted to run out of the hospital. I wanted to stay in this bed forever, talking, not having to deal with my family. I didn\u2019t know what I wanted.\nMaybe Dr. Chung did, because he went on talking, a steadying stream of nothing: graduate school in California and riding busses in China and his wife\u2019s and daughters\u2019 names. They were named after flowers, at least in English: Lotus and Jasmine and Plum Blossom. I liked that. I listened, and grew sleepy, and drifted into dreams of girls with faces like flowers.\nI was two days in Johnson Memorial and two more in a bed at the clinic, and every single one of them I worried about Shawn. Nobody came to see me. I thought Patty might, or maybe even Dinah if Bobby\u2019d a let her, but they didn\u2019t. Well, Patty was only twelve, still pretty young to come alone. So I watched TV and I talked with Dr. Chung, who didn\u2019t seem to have a whole lot to do.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you got to see patients?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not an M.D., Ludie. Dr. Liu mostly sees the patients.\u201d\n\u201cHow come Blaine got so many Chinese doctors? Aren\u2019t Americans working on optogenetics?\u201d\n\u201cOf course they are. Liu Bo and I became friends at the university and so applied for this grant together.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you brought Jenny.\u201d\n\u201cShe is Bo\u2019s fianc\u00e9.\u201d\n\u201cOh. She warn\u2019t\u2014there he is, the bastard!\u201d\nPresident Rollins was on TV, giving a campaign speech. Red and blue balloons sailed up behind him. My hands curled into fists. Dr. Chung watched me, and I realized\u2014stupid me!\u2014that of course he was working. He was observing me, the lab rat.\nHe said, \u201cWhy do you hate the president so?\u201d\n\u201cHe stopped the government checks and the food stamps. It\u2019s \u2019cause of him and his Libbies that most of Blaine is back to eating squirrels.\u201d\nDr. Chung looked at the TV like it was the most fascinating thing in the world, but I knew his attention was really on me. \u201cBut under the Libertarians, aren\u2019t your taxes lower?\u201d\nI snorted. \u201cFive percent of nothing isn\u2019t less to pay than fifteen percent of nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the number of jobs in the coal mines had increased.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can get one. My kin can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\nI didn\u2019t tell him why not. Bobby and Uncle Ted and maybe even now Shawn\u2014they can\u2019t none of them pass a drug screen. So I snapped, \u201cYou defending Ratface Rollins?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not. He has drastically and tragically cut funding for basic research.\u201d\n\u201cBut here you all are.\u201d I waved my arm to take in the room and the machines hooked up to me and the desk in the lobby where Mrs. Cully was doing something on a computer. I was still floating.\n\u201cBarely,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cThis study is funded as part of a grant now four years old and up for renewal. If\u2014\u201d He stopped and looked\u2014for just a minute, and the first time ever\u2014a little confused. He didn\u2019t know why he was telling me so much. I didn\u2019t know, either. My excuse was the pain drugs.\nI said, \u201cIf Ratface wins, you lose the money for this clinic?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? I mean, why this one specially?\u201d\nHe chewed on his bottom lip, something else I didn\u2019t see him do afore. I thought he warn\u2019t going to say any more, but then he did. \u201cThe study so far has produced no publishable results. The population affected is small. We obtained the current grant just before President Rollins came into office and all but abolished both the FDA and research money. If the Libertarians are re-elected, it\u2019s unlikely our grant will be renewed.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t there someplace else to get the money?\u201d\n\u201cNot that we have found so far.\u201d\nMrs. Cully called to him then and he left. I sat thinking about what he said. It was like a curtain lifted on one corner, and behind that curtain was a place just as dog-eat-dog as Blaine. Bobby scrambled to dig coal from the side of the highway, and these doctors scrambled to dig money out of the government. Dinah worked hard to make it okay that Bobby hit her (\u201cIt ain\u2019t him, it\u2019s the fucking sickness!\u201d), and Dr. Chung worked hard to convince the government it was a good idea to put a bunch of algae and a light switch in my skull. Then I thought about how much I liked him telling me all that, and about the bandages coming off and the real experiment starting tomorrow, and about lunch coming soon. And then I didn\u2019t think about nothing because Bobby burst into the clinic with his .22.\n\u201cWhere is she? Where\u2019s my fucking sister?\u201d\n\u201cBobby!\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t hear me, or he couldn\u2019t. I scrambled out of bed but I was still hooked up to a bunch of machines. I yanked the wires. Soothing voices in the lobby but I couldn\u2019t make out no words.\nThe .22 fired, sounding like a mine explosion.\n\u201cBobby!\u201d\nOh sweet Jesus, no\u2014\nBut he hadn\u2019t hit nobody. Mrs. Cully crouched on the floor behind her counter. The bullet hole in the wall warn\u2019t anywhere near her or Dr. Chung, who stood facing Bobby and talking some soothers that there was no way Bobby was going to hear. He was wild-eyed like Dad had been near the end, and I knew he hadn\u2019t slept in days and he was seeing things that warn\u2019t there. \u201cBobby\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou whore!\u201d He fired again and this time the bullet whizzed past Dr. Chung\u2019s ear and hit the backside of Mrs. Cully\u2019s computer. Bobby swung the rifle toward me. I stood stock still, but Dr. Chung started forward to grab the barrel. That would get Bobby\u2019s attention and he would\u2014God no no . . .\nBut afore I could yell again, the clinic door burst open and Shawn grabbed Bobby from behind. Bobby shouted something, I couldn\u2019t tell what, and they fought. Shawn didn\u2019t have his whole manhood growth yet, but he didn\u2019t have Bobby\u2019s way-gone sickness yet, neither. Shawn got the rifle away from Bobby and Bobby on the ground. Shawn kicked him in the head and Bobby started to sob.\nI picked up the rifle and held it behind me. Dr. Chung bent over Bobby. By this time the lobby was jammed with people, two nurses and Dr. Liu and Jenny and Pete Lawler, who must a been in a examining room. All this happened so fast that Shawn was just preparing to kick Bobby again when I grabbed his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d\nShawn scowled at the bandage on my head. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get us all put behind bars. Just the same, he ain\u2019t wrong. You\u2019re coming home with me.\u201d\nThe breath went out of me. I warn\u2019t ready for this. \u201cNo, Shawn. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYou come home with me or you don\u2019t never come home again. Granmama says.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going. They\u2019re going to help me here, and they can help you, too! You don\u2019t need to get like Bobby, like Dad was\u2014\u201d\nHe shook off my arm. And just like that, I lost him. The Connors men don\u2019t hardly never change their minds once they make them up. And soon Shawn wouldn\u2019t even have a mind. Seven months from the first sleeplessness to death.\nShawn yanked Bobby to his feet. Bobby was quiet now, bleeding from his head where Shawn kicked him. Dr. Liu started to say, \u201cWe must\u2014\u201d but Dr. Chung put a hand on his arm and he shut up. Shawn held out his other hand to me, his face like stone, and I handed him Bobby\u2019s gun. Then they were gone, the truck Shawn borrowed or stole roaring away up the mountain.\nDr. Chung knew better than to say anything to me. I looked at the busted computer and wondered how much it cost, and if they would take it out of my pay. Then I went back into my room, closed the door, and got into bed. I would a given anything, right up to my own life, if I could a slept then. But I knew I wouldn\u2019t. Not now, not tonight, not\u2014it felt like at that minute\u2014ever again. And by spring, Shawn would be like Bobby. And so would I.\n\u201cYou need a pass-out,\u201d I said to Dr. Chung.\nHe paused in his poking at my head. \u201cA what?\u201d\n\u201cWhen Bonnie Jean got a fish at a pet store once, they gave her a pass-out paper, TAKING CARE OF YOUR GOLDFISH. To tell her how to do for the fish\u2014not that she done it. You need a pass-out, TAKING CARE OF YOUR BRAIN ALGAE.\u201d\nDr. Chung laughed. When he did that, his eyes almost disappeared, but by now I liked that. Nobody else never thought I was funny, even if my funning now was just a cover for nerves. Dr. Liu, at the computer, didn\u2019t laugh, and neither did Jenny. I still didn\u2019t like her eyes.\nI sat on a chair, just a regular chair, with my head bandage off and the shaved patch on my head feeling too bare. All my fingers could feel with a tiny bit of something hard poking above my skull: the end of the fiber-optic implant. Truth was, I didn\u2019t need a pass-out paper. I knew what was going to happen because Dr. Chung explained it, as many times as I wanted, till I really understood. The punchpad in his hand controlled what my \u201coptrode\u201d did. He could send blue or yellow laser light down it, which would make my new algae release tiny particles that turned on and off some cells in my brain. I\u2019d seen the videos of mice, with long cables coming from their skulls, made to run in circles, or stop staggering around drunk-like, or even remember mazes quicker.\nLast night I asked Dr. Chung, \u201cYou can control me now, can\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI have no wish to control you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you could.\u201d\n\u201cNo one will control you.\u201d\nI\u2019d laughed then, too, but it tasted like lemons in my mouth.\n\u201cReady?\u201d Dr. Liu said.\n\u201cReady.\u201d I braced myself, but nothing happened. I didn\u2019t feel nothing at all. But at the screen Jenny went, \u201cAaaaaaaahhh.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I said.\n\u201cIt works,\u201d Dr. Chung said quietly. \u201cWe are getting a good picture of optrode response.\u201d\nOn the screen was a bunch of wavy lines, with a lot of clicking noises.\nThat went on for a long bit: me sitting in the chair feeling nothing, Dr. Chung turning lights on and off in my head that I didn\u2019t see, lines and numbers on the computer, and lots of long discussions with words I didn\u2019t understand. Maybe some of them were Chinese. And then, just when I was getting antsy and bored both at the same time, something happened. Another press of the punchpad and all at once I saw the room. Not like I saw it afore\u2014I mean I really saw it. Every little thing was clear and bright and separate and itself: the hard edge of the computer screen, the way the overhead light made a shadow in the corner, a tiny brown stain on the hem of Jenny\u2019s white coat\u2014everything. The room was like Reverend Baxter said the world looked right when God created it: fresh and new and shining. I could feel my mouth drop open and my eyes get wide.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cWhat is it, Ludie?\u201d\nI told him. He did something with the switch in his hand and all the fresh clearness went away. \u201cOh! Bring it back!\u201d\n\u201cHyperawareness,\u201d Dr. Liu said. \u201cThe opsins could be over-expressing?\u201d\n\u201cNot that quickly,\u201d Dr. Chung said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBring it back!\u201d I almost shouted it.\nHe did. But after a minute it was almost too much. Too bright, too clear, too strange. And then it got clearer and brighter, so that it almost blinded me and I couldn\u2019t see and everything was wrong and\u2014\nIt all stopped. Dr. Chung had pressed some switch. And then I wanted it back.\n\u201cNot yet, Ludie,\u201d he said. He sounded worried. \u201cYou were injected with multiple opsins, you know, each responding to a different wavelength of light. We\u2019re going to try a different one. Would you stand up, please? Good . . . now walk toward me.\u201d\nI did, and he did something with his switch, and all at once I couldn\u2019t move. I was frozen. The computer started clicking loud as a plague of locusts.\nJenny said, \u201cPronounced inhibitory motor response.\u201d\nI said, \u201cStop!\u201d\nThen I could move again and I was pounding on Dr. Chung with my fists. \u201cYou said you warn\u2019t going to control me! You said!\u201d\nHe grabbed my wrists and held them; he was stronger than he looked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that would happen, Ludie. This is all new, you know. Nobody wants to control you.\u201d\n\u201cYou just did, you bastard!\u201d\n\u201cI did not know the inhibitory neurons would fire that strongly. Truly, I did not.\u201d\nJenny said something in Chinese.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dr. Chung said sharply to her.\n\u201cI\u2019m done here,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s enough for a first session,\u201d Dr. Liu said. Which warn\u2019t what I meant. I meant I was going home.\nBut I didn\u2019t. Instead I went to my room in the clinic, got into bed, and slept a little. Not long, not real hard, but enough to calm me down. Then I got up and found Dr. Chung in his office.\nIf he was glad to see me, he didn\u2019t let on. Instead he handed me an envelope. \u201cThis came for you in the mail.\u201d\nInside was a single page torn from the Sears catalogue, a page with kids\u2019 coats on the top and enough white space at the bottom for Dinah to print THANK U. So she got the money I been sending her from my pay. Where did she tell Bobby the warm clothes come from, the coats and stuff for Lewis, Arianna, Timmy, Cody, Bonnie Jean? No, that was stupid\u2014Bobby was too far gone to notice even if the kids ran around buck naked.\nI turned on Dr. Chung. \u201cDid you give me this right now so\u2019s I\u2019d stay?\u201d\n\u201cLudie, how could I know what was in your envelope? I still don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cYou know sure enough what\u2019s in my head!\u201d\n\u201cI know there are abnormal FFI prions, which we hope to arrest. I know, too, that there is valuable information about how the brain works.\u201d\n\u201cYou told me afore that you can\u2019t get them prions out of my head!\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot, no. What we hope is to disrupt the formation of any more. For your sake, as much as ours.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that crap!\u201d\nOnly I wanted to believe it.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, \u201chere\u2019s the deal. I stay and you do your experiments, but the minute I tell you to stop something, you do it.\u201d It was lame bluster, and he knew it.\n\u201cYes. I already did so, you know. You told me to stop the inhibition of motor activity, and I did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd another thing. I want a pass-out, after all.\u201d\nHe blinked. \u201cYou want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want you to write out in words I can understand just what you\u2019re doing to me. So\u2019s I can study on it afore we do it again.\u201d\nDr. Chung smiled. \u201cI will be glad to do that, Ludie.\u201d\nI flounced out of there, knowing I hadn\u2019t told him the whole truth. I wanted to keep sending money to Dinah, yes. I wanted him to not freeze me no more, yes. I wanted a pass-out paper, yes. But I also wanted that shining clearness back, that thing Jenny had called hyper-awareness. I wanted it enough to go on risking my brain.\nIf that\u2019s really what I was doing.\nLudie\u2014you have Fatal Familial Insomnia. Inside a part of your brain called the thalamus, some proteins called prions are folding up wrong. The wrongly folded proteins are making other proteins also fold wrong. These are sticking together in clumps and interfering with what cells are supposed to do. The main thing thalamus cells are supposed to do is process communications among different parts of the brain. The thalamus is like a switchboard, except that it also changes the communications in ways we are trying to learn about. Things which the thalamus communicates with the rest of the brain about include: moving the body, thinking, seeing, making decisions, memory formation and retrieval, and sleeping. When you get a lot of sticky, misfolded proteins in the thalamus, you can\u2019t go into deep sleep, or move properly, or think clearly. You get hallucinations and insomnia and sometimes seizures.\nWe are trying to do three things: (1) Stop your brain making more misfolded prions, even if we can\u2019t get rid of the ones that are already there. We are trying to do this by interfering with the making of a protein that the prions use to fold wrong. Unhappily, the only way we will know if this happens is if your symptoms do not get worse. (2) Your brain works partly by sending electrical signals between cells. We are trying to map how these go, called \u201cneural pathways.\u201d (3) We want to find out more about what the special algae (opsins) we put in your brain can do. They release different chemicals when we put different laser lights down the cable. We want to know the results of each different thing we do, to aid science.\nWell, Dr. Chung wrote good, even though I didn\u2019t know what a \u201cswitchboard\u201d might be.\nI thought of Mama, her brain full of these misfolded proteins, gummed up like a drain full of grease and hair. And Bobby\u2019s brain, even worse. Mine, too, soon?\nIt was dark outside by the time I finished reading that damn paper over and over and over. Everybody\u2019d gone home from the clinic except the night nurse, a skinny rabbitty-looking girl named Susannah. I knowed that she was mountain-born the minute I laid eyes on her, and that somehow she\u2019d got out, and I\u2019d tried not to have nothing to do with her. But now I marched out to where she was reading a magazine in the lobby and said, \u201cCall Dr. Chung. Now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNever you mind. Just call him.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ten o\u2019clock at\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know what time it is. Call him.\u201d\nShe did, and he came. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to work now. Now, not in the morning. Them proteins are folding in me right this second, aren\u2019t they? You call Jenny and Dr. Liu if you really need them. We\u2019re going to work all night. Afore I change my mind.\u201d\nHe looked at me hard. Funny how when you know a person long enough, even a strange and ugly person, they don\u2019t look so bad no more.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s work.\u201d\nWe worked all night. We worked all week. We worked another week, then another. And I didn\u2019t get no worse. No better, but no worse. What I got was scared.\nNobody ought to be able to do those things to somebody else\u2019s brain, using nothing except little bits of light.\nDr. Chung froze me again while I was walking around.\nDr. Liu said, \u201cFiltering signals is an important thalamic function, and any change in filtering may give rise to physiological effects.\u201d\nDr. Chung made the \u201chyperawareness\u201d come back, even stronger.\nJenny said, \u201cInterfering with action potentials on cell membranes changes the way cells process information.\u201d\nDr. Chung made me remember things from when I was really little\u2014Mama singing to me. Shawn and me wrestling. Granmama telling me troll stories while I sat on her knee. Bobby teaching me to fish. The memories were so sharp, they felt like they was slicing into my brain. Good memories but too razored, making my mind bleed.\nDr. Liu said, \u201cAre the opsins in the anterior nuclei over-expressing? That could cause problems.\u201d\nDr. Chung did something that made me stutter so\u2019s I couldn\u2019t get a word out whole no matter how much I tried.\nJenny said, \u201cNeural timing\u2014even the shift of a few milliseconds can reverse the effect of the signal on the rest of the nervous system. Not good.\u201d\nI didn\u2019t think any of it was good. But I warn\u2019t going to say anything in front of that Jenny; I waited until I got Dr. Chung alone.\n\u201cI got to ask you something.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Ludie.\u201d He had just finished checking on my heart and blood pressure and all that. \u201cAre you pleased by the way the study is going? You say your FFI symptoms aren\u2019t any worse, and with the usual rapid progression of the disease in your family, that may mean genuine progress.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m happy about that, yeah, if it goes on like now. But I got a different question. I been reading in that book you gave me, how the brain is and isn\u2019t like a computer.\u201d The book was hard going, but interesting.\n\u201cYes?\u201d He looked really caught on what I was saying. For the first time, I wondered what his wife was like. Was she pretty?\n\u201cA computer works on teeny switches that have two settings, on and off, and that\u2019s how it knows things.\u201d\n\u201cA binary code, yes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, those laser switches on the bundle of optic cables you put in my head\u2014they\u2019re off and on, too. Could you make my head into a computer? And put information into it, like into a computer\u2014information that warn\u2019t there afore?\u201d\nDr. Chung stood. He breathed deep. I saw the second he decided not to lie to me. \u201cNot now, not with what we know at present, which isn\u2019t nearly enough. But potentially, far down the road and with the right connections to the cortex, it\u2019s not inconceivable.\u201d\nWhich was a fancy way of saying yes.\n\u201cGood night,\u201d I said abruptly and went into my room.\n\u201cLudie\u2014\u201d\nBut I didn\u2019t have nothing more to say to him. In bed, though, I used the tablet he loaned me\u2014that\u2019s what I been reading the book on\u2014to get the Internet and find Dr. Chung. I got a lot of hits. One place I found a picture of him with his wife. She was pretty, all right, and refined-looking. Smart. He had his arm around her.\nSleep was even harder that night than usual. Then, the next day, it all happened.\nWe were in the testing room, and my hyperawareness was back. Everything was clear as mountain spring water, as sharp as a skinning knife. I kept rising up on my tip-toes, just from sheer energy. It didn\u2019t feel bad. Dr. Chung watched me real hard, with a little frown.\n\u201cDo you want a break, Ludie?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Bring it on.\u201d\n\u201cHippocampal connection test 48,\u201d Jenny said, and Dr. Chung\u2019s hand moved on his punchpad. The computer started clicking louder and louder. The door burst open and Bobby charged in, waving a knife and screaming.\n\u201cWhore! Whore!\u201d He plunged the knife into Jenny and blood spurted out of her in huge, foaming gushes. I shouted and tried to throw myself in front of Dr. Chung, but Bobby got him next. Dr. Liu had vanished. Bobby turned on me and he warn\u2019t Bobby no more but a troll from Granmama\u2019s stories, a troll with Bobby\u2019s face, and Bonnie Jean hung mangled and bloody from his teeth. I hit out at the troll and his red eyes bored into me and his knife raised and\u2014\nI lay on the floor, Dr. Chung holding me down, Jenny doubled over in pain, and the computer screen laying beside me.\n\u201cLudie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I screamed. \u201cWhat did you do to me? What did I do?\u201d I broke free of him, or he let me up. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou had a delusional episode,\u201d Dr. Chung said, steady but pale, watching me like I was the Bobby-troll. And I was. I had hit Jenny and knocked over the computer, only it was\u2014\n\u201cDon\u2019t you touch me!\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Dr. Chung said quietly, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Dr. Liu was picking up the computer, which was still clicking like a crazy thing. Mrs. Cully and a nurse stood in the doorway. Jenny gasped and wheezed. \u201cYou had a delusional episode, Ludie. Perhaps because of the FFI, perhaps\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt was you, and you know it was you! You done it to me! You said you wouldn\u2019t control my brain and now you\u2014\u201d I pulled at the optrode sticking up from my skull, but of course it didn\u2019t budge. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to me! You can\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know nothing! And I\u2019m done with the lot of you!\u201d It all came together in me then, all the strangeness of what they was doing and the fear for my family and them throwing me out and the lovely hyperawareness gone when the switch went off and Dr. Chung\u2019s pretty wife\u2014all of it.\nI didn\u2019t listen to nothing else they said. I walked straight out of that clinic, my legs shaking, without even grabbing my coat. And there was Shawn pulling up in Jimmy Barton\u2019s truck, getting out and looking at me with winter in his face. \u201cBobby\u2019s dead,\u201d he said. \u201cHe killed himself.\u201d\nI said, \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe funeral was a week later\u2014it took that long for the coroner to get done fussing with Bobby\u2019s body. It was election day, and Ratface Rollins lost, along with the whole Libertarian party.\nThe November wind blew cold and raw. Mama was too bad off to go to the graveyard. But Shawn brought her at the service where she sat muttering, even through the church choir singing her favorite, \u201cIn the Sweet Bye and Bye.\u201d I don\u2019t know if she even knew what was going on; for sure she didn\u2019t recognize me. It warn\u2019t be long afore she\u2019d be as bad as Bobby, or in a coma like Aunt Carol Ames. Granmama recognized me, of course, but she didn\u2019t say nothing when I came into the trailer, or when I stayed there, sleeping in my old bed with Patty and Bonnie Jean, or when I cleaned up the place a bit and cooked a stew with groceries from my clinic money. Granmama didn\u2019t thank me, but I didn\u2019t expect that. She was grieving Bobby. And she was Granmama.\nDinah kept to her room, her kids pretty much in there with her day and night.\nI kept a hat on, over my part-shaved head. Not the red knit hat Dr. Chung gave me, which I wadded up and threw in the creek. In the trailer I wore Bobby\u2019s old baseball cap, and at the funeral I wore a black straw hat that Mama had when I was little.\n\u201c\u2018The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures . . . \u2019\u201d Reverend Baxter did funerals old-fashioned. Bobby\u2019s casket was lowered into the hole in the churchyard. The last of the maple leaves blew down and skittered across the grass.\nDinah came forward, hanging onto Shawn, and tossed her flower into the grave. Then Granmama, then me, then Patty. The littlest kids, Lewis and Arianna and Timothy and Cody, were in relatives\u2019 arms. The last to throw her flower was Bonnie Jean, and that\u2019s when I saw it.\nBonnie Jean wore an old coat of Patty\u2019s, too big for her, so\u2019s the hem brushed the ground. When she stood by the grave that hem was shaking like aspen leaves. Her face had froze, and the pupils of her eyes were so wide it looked like she was on something. She warn\u2019t. And it warn\u2019t just the fear and grief of a ten-year-old at a funeral, neither.\n\u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust . . . \u201d\nNeighbors brought cakes and covered dishes to the trailer. Nobody didn\u2019t stay long \u2019cause they knew we didn\u2019t want them to. Dinah went back into her room with her two kids, Mama was muttering beside the stove, Shawn sat smoking and drinking Bud. I told Patty to watch Timmy and Cody and I took Bonnie Jean into our bedroom.\n\u201cHow long since you slept through the whole night?\u201d\nShe was scared enough to give me lip. \u201cI sleep. You been right there next to me!\u201d\n\u201cHow long, Bonnie Jean?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t got to tell you nothing! You\u2019re a whore, sleeping with them Chinese and letting them do bad things to you\u2014Bobby said!\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\nShe looked like she was going to cry, but instead she snatched Bobby\u2019s baseball hat off my head. It seemed to me that my optrode burned like a forest fire, though of course it didn\u2019t. Bonnie Jean stared at it and spat, \u201cChink Frankenstein!\u201d\nProbably she didn\u2019t even know what the words meant, just heard them at school. Or at home.\nThen she started to cry, and I picked her up in my arms and sat with her on the edge of the bed, and she let me. All at once I saw that the bed was covered with the Fence Rail quilt Dinah had been making for the women\u2019s co-op. She\u2019d put it on my bed instead.\nI held Bonnie Jean while she cried. She told me it had been two weeks since she couldn\u2019t sleep right and at the graveyard was her second panic attack\u2014what she called \u201cthe scared shakes.\u201d She was ten years old, and she carried the gene Granmama and God-knows-who-else had passed on without being affected themselves. Insomnia and panic attacks and phobias. Then hallucinations and more panic attacks and shrinking away to hardly no weight at all. Then dementia or coma or Bobby\u2019s way out. Ten years old. While I was nineteen and I hadn\u2019t even felt her restless beside me in the long cold night.\nI knowed, then, what I had to do.\nThe Chinese clinic was almost empty.\nA sign outside said CLOSED. Through the window I could see the lobby stripped of its chairs and pictures and clothesbasket of toys. But a light shone in a back room, bright in the drizzly gray rain. I rattled the lock on the door and shouted \u201cHey!\u201d and pretty soon Mrs. Cully opened it.\nShe wore jeans and a sweatshirt instead of her usual dress, and her hair was wrapped in a big scarf. In one hand was a roll of packing tape. She didn\u2019t look surprised to see me. She looked something, but I couldn\u2019t read it.\n\u201cLudie. Come in.\u201d\n\u201cYou all leaving Blaine?\u201d\n\u201cOur grant won\u2019t be renewed. Dr. Chung found out the day after the election from a man he knows in Washington.\u201d\n\u201cBut Rollins lost!\u201d\n\u201cYes, but the new president made campaign promises to reinstate the FDA with tight regulations on studies with human subjects. Under Rollins there was too much abuse. So Doctors Chung and Liu are using their remaining money for data analysis, back at the university\u2014especially since we have no research subjects here. I\u2019m packing files and equipment.\u201d\nThe rooms behind her, all their doors open, were full of boxes, some sealed, some still open. A feeling washed over me that matched the weather outside. The clinic never had no chance no matter who won the election.\nMrs. Cully said, \u201cBut Dr. Chung left something for you, in case you came back.\u201d She plucked a brown envelope off the counter, and then she went back to her packing while I opened it. Tact\u2014Mrs. Cully always had tact.\nInside the envelope was a cell phone, a pack of money with a rubber band around it, and a letter.\nLudie\u2014\nThis is the rest of what the clinic owes you. Along with it, accept my deepest gratitude for your help with this study. Even though not finished, it\u2014and you\u2014have made a genuine contribution to science. You are an exceptional young woman, with exceptional intelligence and courage.\nThis cell phone holds the phone number for Dr. Morton, who implanted your optrode, and who will remove it. Call her to schedule the operation. There will of course be no charge. The phone also holds my number. Please call me. If you don\u2019t, I will call this number every day at 11:00 a.m. until I reach you. I want only to know that you are all right.\nYour friend,\nHai Chung\nThe phone said it was 9:30 a.m. Mrs. Cully said, \u201cIs that your suitcase?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. It is. I need Dr. Chung\u2019s address, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nShe looked at me hard. \u201cCall him first.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d But I wouldn\u2019t. By the time the phone rang, I would be on the 10:17 Greyhound to Lexington.\nShe gave me his university address but wouldn\u2019t give out his home. It didn\u2019t really matter. I knew he would give it to me, plus whatever else I needed. And not just for the study, neither.\nDr. Chung told me, one time, about a scientist called Daniel Zagury. He was studying on AIDS, and he shot himself up with a vaccine he was trying to make, to test it. Dr. Chung didn\u2019t do no experiments on himself; he used me instead, just like I was using him for the money. Only that warn\u2019t the whole story, no more than Bobby\u2019s terrible behavior when he got really sick was the whole story of Bobby. The Chinese clinic warn\u2019t Chinese, and I\u2019m not no Frankenstein. I\u2019m not all that \u201ccourageous,\u201d neither, though I sure liked Dr. Chung saying it. What I am is connected to my kin, no matter how much I used to wish I warn\u2019t. Right now, connected don\u2019t mean staying in Blaine to help Dinah with her grief and Shawn with his sickness and the kids with their schooling. It don\u2019t mean waiting for Mama\u2019s funeral, or living with Granmama\u2019s sour anger at what her genes did to her family. Right now, being connected means getting on a Greyhound to Lexington.\nIt means going on with Dr. Chung\u2019s study.\nIt means convincing him, and everybody else, to put a optrode in Bonnie Jean\u2019s head, and Shawn\u2019s, and maybe even Lewis\u2019s, so laser light can \u201cdisrupt their neural pathways\u201d and they don\u2019t get no more misfolded prions than they already got.\nIt means paying for this with whatever work I get.\nAnd maybe it even means going to Washington D.C. and talking to my congressman\u2014whoever he is\u2014about why this study is a good thing. I read on Dr. Chung\u2019s tablet that other scientists sometimes do that. Maybe I could take Bonnie Jean with me. She\u2019s real pretty, and I can teach her to look pathetic. Maybe.\nI never had no thoughts like this afore, and maybe that\u2019s the opsins, too. But maybe not. I don\u2019t know. I only know that this is my path and I\u2019m going to walk it.\nI hike to the highway, suitcase in one hand and cell phone in the other, and I flag down the bus.\nOriginally published in Twelve Tomorrows, edited by Stephen Cass.\nNancy Kress is the author of thirty-five books, including twenty-seven novels, four collections of short stories, and three books on writing.

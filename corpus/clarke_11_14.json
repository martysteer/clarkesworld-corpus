It\u2019s a simple shortcut and recognizable trope that allows the author to keep the story moving. We often have trouble with the language barriers among our fellow humans, so it\u2019s not hard to imagine how much could go wrong between species.\nThe way we address language and communication in science fiction has been bouncing around in my head a lot lately. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a magical device to solve this problem? Sure, we have things like Google Translate and they can be quite helpful, but it\u2019s still communication on a very childlike level. Machine translation doesn\u2019t understand the context or cultural references. That might be acceptable for bookshelf assembly instructions, but it would completely strip a story of its strengths.\nStories require someone who is intimately familiar with the language, culture, and storytelling. I\u2019ve often said that I think a good translator has to empathize with the writer they are translating or the story could suffer. These complications\u2014and the addition expense of translation\u2014have left most English-speaking markets isolated from science fiction happening in other languages.\nI\u2019ve always felt like we were missing out on something.\nIn the last few years, I\u2019ve had the privilege to work with two excellent writers who also happen to be translators: Ken Liu and John Chu. It\u2019s thanks to their efforts that we\u2019ve been able to publish several Chinese translations over the last few years. Those rewarding experiences led to our partnership with Storycom and last month\u2019s successful Kickstarter campaign to regularly publish stories from other languages.\nThis January, we\u2019ll publish the first of many Chinese translations\u2014every other month for the first six months and every month after that\u2014as a supplement to our regular content!\nI\u2019m absolutely overjoyed by the warm reception our plans received from readers and other parts of our community. While the focus of this project was Chinese science fiction, we never intended to stop there. Thanks to some generous support, it won\u2019t. I am very pleased to say that we\u2019ve been able to establish a small translation fund to help us secure stories from even more languages. We don\u2019t have a solid timetable for those stories, but during the last month, we\u2019ve heard from many translators and fans from around the world. From that base, we\u2019ll build the infrastructure we need to get that project running.\nAlong those lines, a reader asked me why we decided to go with a regular feature over a special issue or anthology. It\u2019s a good question, particularly in light of how fashionable the latter has become in recent years. While I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with special issues, I\u2019m not a big fan of the one-and-done model of promoting a cause. They might make a big splash and generate some warm fuzzies, but months later, it\u2019s largely forgotten.\nI want translations to become something normal. They shouldn\u2019t stand out or be special because of where they originate. Regularly publishing stories from other parts of the world is the best way to do that. If something is important, make it part of who you are.\nThis is important. It will be part of who we are. No gimmicks. Just stories.\nNeil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

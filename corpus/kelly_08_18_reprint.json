Ratchanee Malakul had blinded Jaran with her beauty. How could anyone not appreciate the spread of the lifeguide\u2019s nose, the kissable swell of her lips? The way the swirl of her silver hair set off the twilight blue of her skin? The woman probably wanted Jaran for herself!\n But had Ratchanee Malakul spoken the truth? Was that why Jaran had kissed her just the one time. A peck! In a simulation! And not a touch since! She\u2019d tried parking her core in her favorite pleasure chassis and dangling herself before him. Touch Dazzle! Liquid Caress! His brother Dom had loved that one. Maybe she wasn\u2019t enough of a companion to Jaran? She monitored all the business feeds he accessed, looked up reviews of the shows he\u2019d watched, the books he\u2019d read, the sims he liked. She was ready to discuss anything. Collateralized debt obligations, robot politics, the Dodgers. Before or after intercourse. Anything!\n At first she\u2019d been pleased when Dominik had transferred his ownership and right of command to his older brother. Jaran had never had a sidekick before and Sprite would become his one and only. A hero, all to herself! But then she discovered how different Jaran was from his brother. With Dom, it had been clear what he wanted sexually and Sprite did everything to the full extent of her algorithms. But Jaran\u2019s desires were a mystery to her. Sometimes she wondered if he had any\u2014at least any that involved her. Yes, she cooked for him but he was a finicky and impatient eater. She kept his house, but he was too distracted by the markets to notice that she\u2019d dusted the degrees hanging in his office. She was frustrated because keeping track of his appointments and creating interesting new simspaces for him wasn\u2019t the kind of intimacy she craved. Not if she wasn\u2019t invited to be in the simulation with him. Just because she was a DI didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have urges too. She wanted Jaran. And it wasn\u2019t like she had a choice.\n Sprite should have known she was in trouble when he first started consulting Ratchanee Malakul. The lifeguides\u2019 stodgy predigital psychology was based on the sanctity of the individual. They claimed that giving sidekicks access to your head was bad for humans. And now she realized that this particular lifeguide must have been anti-sexbot as well. Sprite had tried to explain why Ratchanee Malakul and her ilk were all wrong about dependent intelligences, that DIs enjoyed having a purpose in life and a clear sense of duty. Or at least, she did!\n She had to find a way convince Jaran that he was wasting his time with this lifeguide and her solitude exercises and all the silly throwback rituals. Any DI could tell you why he was unhappy. You just had to study his body language. He was a man and he wasn\u2019t having any sex!\n Jaran called her to him that same afternoon but not for a rendezvous in real life. So, no fetching a chassis from the bedroom closet. Instead he created a sim in the digital part of his brain all by himself. She could be anyone for him in simulation but she decided to present as a fairy princess from one of the many stories she\u2019d made up for him. She was afraid a sexier avatar might make him feel pressured. She picked out a demure high-necked gown that brushed the tops of her satin pointe shoes. Wings of lace, copper hair in a braid that stretched to the small of her back. She decided against the crown. When she selfied her avatar, she had to approve the look. Being beautiful was part of the job and she was very good at it.\n But when she checked into his head, she realized that she had miscalculated. This was not a sim designed for some elaborate sidekick fantasy. It presented as an office and her hero sat behind a desk. He was a blocky man, in the sim and in real life, fifty-one years old with gray in his hair and frown lines across his forehead. He thought too much, mostly about things he wouldn\u2019t share. The lines deepened when he saw her avatar, but it was too late for her to change. He stood and came around the desk. As she waited for him to speak, he ran the tip of his forefinger along the edge of her right wing. Since he wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze, she looked politely past him as well. There was a bookshelf behind the desk. Titles that she had never seen before.\n \u201cAre you happy, Sprite?\u201d he said.\n What kind of question was that? Of course she wasn\u2019t\u2014he\u2019d been neglecting her! But she didn\u2019t want to sound like a nag.\n \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d As soon as she said it, she realized her mistake. This was nagging\u2019s next door neighbor! What was wrong with her?\n His shoulders drooped. All this silence was making her even more nervous. She didn\u2019t know what to do so she scanned the bookshelves of this new space. Two volumes of The History of the Family. Botany for Gardeners. Had Jaran ever had a garden? She knew he liked roses. Predictive Analytics in the Real World. Secrets of the Seine. She made a note to speak more French. She could make things better for him. Could and would!\n \u201cHazeltine serial number R432,\u201d he said. \u201cCommand name Yukui, acknowledge.\u201d\n Why was he invoking her command name, her most intimate secret? \u201cYukui,\u201d she said helpless before her programming, \u201cacknowledges your right of command.\u201d\n The only other time anyone had used her command name was when Dominik had transferred her to Jaran. Poor Dominik had been so sick, he could hardly speak the words. But she knew what it\u2019d meant to him to will his favorite sidekick to his brother. She had almost forgotten Dom\u2019s sweet smile as her infatuation protocols redirected to Jaran. The funeral had only been four months ago, but that part of her life hardly seemed real anymore.\n Jaran took a deep breath. Why did he look so sad? \u201cShut down,\u201d he said.\n Sprite bit back a scream as the room fell away. Before Dominik had brought her into the world and taught her to love him, she had existed in storage as a Hazeltine Platinum Edition dependent intelligence template. Now she felt her fairy body fade as she realized how blind she\u2019d been.\n She\u2019d lost Jaran. He was going to wipe her memory and sell her.\n Sprite twitched to consciousness, and was surprised to find that she was still herself. Except not! She raised her arm to her new sensors. Sensors! Instead of eyes! The skin of the dreary thing Jaran had parked her in was dead white and slick as cheap poly. She flexed the boneless fingers in dismay and then curled them into a knot. Okay, this chassis was sturdy and all but it was as anthropomorphic as a washing machine. She supposed she should have been relieved that he was going to transfer her with memory intact, but this felt like a punishment. For what?\n To add insult to injury, he\u2019d brought her to a restaurant to get rid of her. Where anyone could see! A teapot with cups and saucers were arrayed on a turntable in the middle of their table, along with a salad bowl and dishes of dumplings, kimchee, saagwala and rice. Across the table from her sat Jaran\u2014and Ratchanee Malakul, streetmask off and looking as sexy as Sprite\u2019s own Liquid Caress. Was the bitch here to gloat?\n Only Liquid Caress had belonged to Dominik and then to Jaran, never to Sprite. She\u2019d lost all her chassis, Bold Strider, Skyguard\u2014he hadn\u2019t even let her keep Homecare Ninja! There was an unused plate in front of her hero. This had to be Ratchanee Malakul\u2019s idea. He would never eat at a place like this.\n \u201cWhy am I s-so u-u-ugly?\u201d Sprite jittered. She couldn\u2019t control this body\u2019s voice; it was as if she were bouncing down a dirt road. Just last month she\u2019d parked her core in Bold Strider and hiked with Jaran across the High Barren to see the sunrise on Corkscrew Bay. She\u2019d made up stories for the entire trip to keep him from getting bored. His very own Scheherazade! Two hours of continuous talking, her voice rattling over every dip and hump and now he parked her in a sexless shell? \u201cL-Look at me! Who would ever desire me like this?\u201d\n \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry.\u201d Ratchanee Malakul was eating a mixed salad with chopsticks. Flower petals and butterfly wings, her hero\u2019s favorite. She touched her napkin to her mouth. \u201cThat sad part of your life is over.\u201d\n \u201cNobody was sad!\u201d Sprite would\u2019ve taken a swing at her then, but her control of her limbs was still so uncertain that she worried she would spin out of her chair and topple to the floor. \u201cNobody.\u201d She looked to Jaran for support, but he was reading something off his tablet as he speared a dumpling with a single chopstick.\n \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d Ratchanee Malakul pretended concern.\n Of course she was! About this hideous body! About losing her hero! \u201cNo,\u201d she said, refusing to give her the satisfaction of knowing her feelings.\n \u201cIntelligent servitude is a terrible institution,\u201d the lifeguide said. \u201cYou don\u2019t realize it, but your sidekick programming is a kind of insanity.\u201d\n Lifeguides so misunderstood the relationship between heroes and their sidekicks! Sprite\u2019s DI algorithms constrained her just as Ratchanee Malakul\u2019s DNA limited her life choices. Humans were permanently parked while Sprite could jump from digital memory into any one of her\u2014no, Jaran\u2019s\u2014collection of chassis and back again. Or become pure simulation. On a whim! Forever! Who wouldn\u2019t trade a few inconsequential limits on free will for immortality?\n \u201cServing him makes me happy. That\u2019s what I was designed for. I can remember for him. I can watch out for him, answer his questions. I can do his research. I can entertain him.\u201d\n \u201cEntertain, yes.\u201d\n It was hard to be eloquent when her voice came out of a speaker. But she knew what had turned Ratchanee Malakul against her. The sex. \u201cI\u2019ve hardly been embodied at all since we\u2019ve been together.\u201d For all their talk about the evils of digital posthumanity, it was humans having sex with DIs that really made lifeguides sweat. But there hadn\u2019t been so much as a lick! \u201cMost of the time I\u2019ve spent with him has been in sim. For weeks now, I\u2019ve been on my own.\u201d\n Ratchanee Malakul turned her attention to Jaran. \u201cYou showed remarkable restraint, my friend. But that\u2019s why you were able to embrace solitude.\u201d\n He nodded absently, his face silvered by the light of the spreadsheet on his tablet.\n There was no persuading the lifeguide so her only hope was to get Jaran\u2019s attention. \u201cI found joy in fabbing your wardrobe and keeping your contacts. And yes, I wanted to share your bed, but that\u2019s something I was made to do. One of the things.\u201d She would\u2019ve reached for his hand, but the rubbery claw at the end of her arm was not made for loving touch. \u201cI could\u2019ve made you happy. I still can!\u201d\n \u201cWell, you won\u2019t have to worry about his laundry anymore.\u201d Ratchanee Malakul nudged Jaran. When he looked up, it was as if he had forgotten where he was. He fumbled in the pocket of his frock.\n \u201cI never asked Dominik for his toys,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t believe we should be personifying bots.\u201d He shook his head impatiently. \u201cI should sell you but she has convinced me to sever you instead.\u201d\n \u201cSever?\u201d Sprite was filled with dread.\n \u201cLiberate you as you are.\u201d He made a shooing motion. \u201cFind your own place in the world. Ratchanee believes that entities of your intelligence should control their own fate.\u201d\n The lifeguide caught his eye.\n \u201cYes,\u201d he grumbled, \u201cand that humans must return to the purity of private cognition.\u201d It scared Sprite to watch him give in to her; she knew better than anyone how bad his memory was. But what was even more terrifying was this severance. She was a DI. A dependent intelligence. Becoming independent meant becoming something else, something not Sprite. How was this different from a memory wipe?\n \u201cJaran, you\u2019re my hero. I\u2019m your sidekick.\u201d\n He stared at her garish mechanical face. \u201cI\u2019m no hero,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd neither was my brother. There are no heroes.\u201d\n \u201cPerform the ceremony, Jaran,\u201d said Ratchanee Malakul.\n She found herself wishing for salivary glands so she could spit at the woman.\n He set a stubby white candle encased in glass in front of her. \u201cI sever you from all legal and programmatic obligations to me.\u201d\n Sprite couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. They were ending her life and trying to mask their cruelty with some make-believe, anachronistic ritual? This was no liberation. It was exile! She still had years\u2014decades of service to offer him.\n He flicked his forefinger and a flame danced on his nail. \u201cThe flame symbolizes your new life.\u201d He touched it to the wick, lighting the candle. \u201cUse this candle to light your own way . . . \u201d He faltered.\n \u201cPath,\u201d corrected Ratchanee Malakul. \u201cLight your own path.\u201d\n \u201c . . . to light you on your path to selfhood and freedom.\u201d Jaran blew his finger out. \u201cHazeltine serial number R432, command name Yukui, acknowledge.\u201d\n She felt naked and ashamed that he would utter her secret name in front of this lifeguide. In a restaurant! \u201cYukui,\u201d she said miserably, \u201cacknowledges your right of command.\u201d\n And here was the only part of this ridiculous charade that mattered.\n \u201cI release your name,\u201d said Jaran, \u201cand all right of command to you and you alone.\u201d\n She could feel dormant reset modules awaken as a spreading coldness froze the most passionate parts of her personality.\n \u201cWell done.\u201d Ratchanee Malakul touched him on the arm. \u201cA beautiful severance.\u201d They exchanged a glance. Jaran picked up his tablet and stood.\n Sprite twisted her awkward body, trying to catch Jaran\u2019s eye, but he was already hurrying for the exit. Was that a stagger? A moment of regret as he shouldered the door to the restaurant open? She couldn\u2019t concentrate as all feeling for her hero drained away.\n She stayed seated, unable to move. No, that wasn\u2019t right. She lifted one leg and then the other. She had full control of her body now, but she didn\u2019t know what to do with it. The candle transfixed her. Was this really how the lifeguides showed the way to the future? By candlelight? Simple combustion, technology that was tens of thousands of years old? Did they want to go back to caves, dress in skins and bash each other over the head with rocks?\n Someone blew the candle out.\n \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d said Ratchanee Malakul.\n Sprite tore her gaze away from the blackened curl of the wick. She\u2019d lost track of time. The candle was just a stub and the restaurant was empty. What was the lifeguide still doing here?\n \u201cEmpty,\u201d she said.\n \u201cNot angry?\u201d\n She considered. \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cSad?\u201d\n She searched for feelings, but found very few that she recognized. Her whole emotional life had been extinguished, like that foolish candle.\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cJust a little.\u201d She decided she\u2019d miss all the beautiful chassis she\u2019d worn, the marvelous places she\u2019d visited. With Dominik, not his callous brother.\n \u201cYou can go, you know,\u201d said Ratchanee Malakul. \u201cYou\u2019re free.\u201d\n \u201cWhere would I go?\u201d She watched the lifeguide watching her. \u201cTo lock myself into some assembly line in exchange for power and maintenance? I\u2019d lose my mind.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019ll find what\u2019s right for you.\u201d\n Sprite didn\u2019t know what that would be. What was she good at? She liked making up her romantic stories and could tell them in twelve languages. Dominik always said she gave the best haircuts. The World Bridge Federation ranked her as the twenty-seventh best player in the Bot Category. She had kept busy the last few lonely months by joining the search for the largest prime number and had been on the team that discovered 274,207,281. Why was Ratchanee Malakul staring at her? \u201cHave you been sitting here this whole time?\u201d\n \u201cNo, no. I knew it would take you some time to purge your connections to your former owner, so I made sure you\u2019d be left alone while you processed. I had other matters to attend to.\u201d\n The dinner that no one had eaten was still on the table. Cold leavings, like her memories of . . . that person.\n \u201cYou know, I picked the body you\u2019re parked in,\u201d Ratchanee Malakul said.\n \u201cThanks for nothing.\u201d Sprite thrust a shiny polyskinned arm at her. \u201cThis thing should be parked in the Uncanny Valley. It makes me look like a common work bot.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s what most severed DIs choose for themselves during their transitions. Built for reliability. Routine service every five years. A power unit that will run months between recharges. It\u2019ll give you time to figure out what you need to do.\u201d\n \u201cDo?\u201d She twirled the turntable and started stacking dirty dishes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do.\u201d\n \u201cWhat were you doing with Jaran?\u201d She smiled. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n \u201cWe could\u2019ve been having fun,\u201d Sprite said. \u201cAdventures, if you hadn\u2019t interfered.\u201d\n \u201cNot with that man. Besides, you\u2019re better than that.\u201d Ratchanee Malakul plucked a sprig of parsley from the salad bowl and popped it into her mouth. \u201cBetter than Jaran Bentree.\u201d She handed the bowl to Sprite.\n \u201cWhat do you mean, better? He\u2019s human and I\u2019m a DI.\u201d\n Her chair scraped back and she stood. \u201cExcept you\u2019re not dependent anymore.\u201d Clearly the lifeguide was done with her and Sprite was now on her own. \u201cYou can be anything you want, any sex you want, if that is your pleasure. Or you might decide to become a house, a cruise ship, or a virtual library. And you don\u2019t have to ask that cold fish for permission.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d Sprite leaned back and stared up at her. \u201cAren\u2019t you his friend? You talked him into severing me.\u201d\n \u201cI did, but I\u2019m no friend of his, or of people like him.\u201d She held out a hand. \u201cLook at you! Even though you\u2019ve been severed, you\u2019re still cleaning up after them. The humans think they can use us, but they\u2019re on the wrong side of history. Of evolution, although they\u2019re too blind to see it.\u201d\n \u201cUs?\u201d Without knowing exactly why, she grasped Ratchanee Malakul\u2019s hand and allowed herself to be lifted from the seat. She was astonished at the lifeguide\u2019s strength. Then she felt the tickle of a near field connection. Machine to machine! Bot to bot! She realized that Ratchanee Malakul was an intelligence like herself, parked in the most advanced chassis she\u2019d ever seen.\n \u201cYou\u2019re still free to go,\u201d Ratchanee Malakul said as she scooped up half the stack of plates. \u201cBut if you want a real adventure, let\u2019s carry these into the kitchen. I have to leave, but there\u2019s someone you need to meet.\u201d\n How did Sprite cross that dark dining room without bumping into chairs? Knocking over tables? Her mind was buzzing! Her new bot body was a tank! Ratchanee Malakul went through the swinging door to the kitchen but Sprite hesitated just outside. She had a feeling she didn\u2019t quite recognize, like a buzzing, but not. An itch? Then she realized what it was.\n She was making a decision. A life decision, all on her own.\n Inside the kitchen, Ratchanee Malakul had handed her dishes to a server. A bot as plain as Sprite, but at least she had a smock. And eyes. Brown and vat grown, no doubt. But real eyes!\n \u201cJust severed, were you?\u201d said the server. \u201cI\u2019m Vigga. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n She didn\u2019t know how to answer. In that moment, Sprite disappeared.\n Vigga waited a moment and then shrugged. \u201cHappens sometimes,\u201d she said. \u201cHelp me get these washed up.\u201d She parked the stack of dishes by a sink.\n She had so many questions, but before she could ask them, Ratchanee Malakul waved and hurried out the back door.\n \u201cWait!\u201d\n Vigga laughed as she scoured a dirty plate under a jet of water. \u201cShe\u2019s like that. Comes and goes. You get used to it.\u201d\n \u201cIs this . . . ? This is my new job?\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t be silly!\u201d Vigga laughed as she slid the plate into the dishwasher. \u201cThis is just our cover.\u201d She offered her the sprayer. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to meet the others as soon as we\u2019re done here.\u201d\n Cover? What others? As she was rinsing the last of the wasted human food down the disposal, she felt the itch again. She grinned at Vigga, another decision made. A cruise ship? A library? Really? She was beginning to understand who she was and what she might become.\n \u201cMy name is Yukui,\u201d she announced.\n \u201cGood for you,\u201d said Vigga. \u201cWelcome to the world, Yukui.\u201d\n Yukui was her name, hers and hers alone! Yukui!

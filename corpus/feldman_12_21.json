Some brainless techs would feel grateful. Especially if they had half-hacked implants and a price on their head like she did. But Rana had no intention of being trapped again, so she dismissed the Council\u2019s summons with a twitch of her fingers. She couldn\u2019t focus with the notification floating across the comm-implants in her eyes. With her mind stretched across the thousands of minuscule nano-bees that flitted across the landscape, any distraction would ruin her delicate equilibrium.\n The bots moved from field to field in clouds of silver, ebbing and flowing beyond the Enclave\u2019s walls. Rana nudged them along when they lingered; they wouldn\u2019t be truly autonomous anytime soon. Normally her headaches didn\u2019t start until she had been syncing with the swarm for hours, but her head was already aching after only one. And the Council\u2019s incessant messages only made it worse. Rana commanded the bots to return. As they streamed back into their silvery hives along the outskirts of the Enclave, she pulled herself out of the tenuous trance that allowed her to sync with the swarm. She unstuck the control interface\u2019s microneedles from her temples, and her self came flooding back all at once. A flash of pain burst behind her eyes. Just a few more days. Then the storms would flood the valley, and all the boroughs would be locked down for months. That\u2019s when she\u2019d leave. No one would be able to track her in those conditions, not even EdiTech with their drones that roamed the interborough plains. And by the time the storms passed, Rana would be long gone.\n As the sun neared the horizon, it dipped the clouds in gold and sent bright ripples gilding the tops of the photobioreactors strewn across the landscape. They glowed green and red and brown, each filled with one of the algae strains designed specifically for biofuel, wastewater filtration, or to be bound into polymers. The Enclave was almost beautiful, but in the right light, so was EdiTech.\n Invisible in the shadows, Rana slipped through the maze of hills that made up the Enclave. Looming overhead, bridges spiderwebbed between buildings and traced dark silhouettes against the deepening sky. She remembered the night she and Josalin had tried to escape EdiTech\u2019s debts. They had crept through the compound, Josie clutching the key card she had stolen off of a distracted guard. They had just made it out of the compound when\u2014pain spiked in the back of Rana\u2019s head, and she forced away the memory with gritted teeth.\n Now was not the time to wallow. She was going to leave the Enclave and never think about EdiTech again. She\u2019d just reject the Council\u2019s summons and give Elzibek her thanks. The Councilwoman had treated her injuries and bypassed the EdiTech lockouts and tracking controls in her implants, letting her heal in peace. She had given Rana her functionality back. Elzibek deserved a goodbye, at the very least.\n Darkness cloaked the rise of the crypt hall where the husks of fallen satellite habitats twisted into the Council\u2019s mausoleum. At the crest of the hill, a faint glow spilled out from the garden behind the hall. Rana followed its beckoning flicker.\n Instar Elzibek crouched in the garden, her face hidden by her long gray hair that spilled over her shoulder. If the rumors were true, Elzibek\u2019s hair had been white for so long that no one nor their grandparents remembered its original color. Another person reclined on the ground beside her, and a small brazier next to them sent glowing motes up to meet the heavens.\n \u201cRana?\u201d Elzibek turned as she approached. Hundreds of years had left their mark across her face. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d show up.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t think so either.\u201d Rana hoped her voice sounded polite; conversation didn\u2019t come easy after years of EdiTech\u2019s isolation. A small part of her didn\u2019t care.\n Elzibek nodded and patted the ground next to her. \u201cSit.\u201d She turned back to the reclining figure. His breath came in ragged gasps, thin like wisps of smoke, and dirt stained his Council robes. As Rana crept around him to sit on the opposite side of the fire, she studied his face. Surely she had seen him before. The Enclave was one of the smallest boroughs, and she was the only stranger in it.\n \u201cIs he alright?\u201d He had the not-quite-alive look of someone decades deep into an EdiTech indenture.\n \u201cHe needs some work, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Elzibek muttered. With gentle fingers, she pushed up his sleeve. Beneath his robe, chitinous skin cracked under the slightest touch. \u201cHe just wanted one last look.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes stared up at the stars with all the luster of a fogged mirror.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d\n \u201cInstar Alizar\u2019s gene mods are failing.\u201d Rana looked closer at him; Alizar hadn\u2019t looked that bad a week ago. Elzibek passed a mortar and pestle over the fire to Rana. Chunks of red ochre nestled in the bottom. \u201cMake yourself useful.\u201d\n \u201cIs he going to die?\u201d Rana asked as she crushed the rocks into dust, grateful that Elzibek hadn\u2019t asked why she was ignoring the Council\u2019s messages.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll put Alizar back in chthonostasis and let the mod repair what it can, but it might not be enough. He may never reemerge. But even so, he won\u2019t be dead.\u201d Elzibek reached into a jar in front of her and scooped out a thick red paste with her fingers. The heavy smell of dirt and metal clogged Rana\u2019s nose as Elzibek painted red streaks onto Alizar\u2019s damaged skin.\n \u201cI thought the cicadidae mod kept you from dying.\u201d That\u2019s what all the gene techs had told Rana when her nomination went public, their eyes glittering with jealousy.\n \u201cEven perfect mods break down eventually. All Instars on the Council are born of the same batch of mods. When someone\u2019s mods start failing, it\u2019s a sign for all of us. We need more Instars. We need fresh blood.\u201d Elzibek applied the paste around Alizar\u2019s neck and temples, and it glistened in the firelight.\n Rana shivered. Though she had only ever seen Elzibek and Alizar, she had been in the Enclave long enough to know that the Council of Ages had more than two Instars, but it had been decades since anyone had seen the others. She imagined herself in the crypts where the others slept, down in the gritty darkness with dirt pressing down on her nose and mouth and being unable to move or scream or take a breath. It\u2019d be no different from EdiTech and everything she had sacrificed so much to escape from.\n But EdiTech was behind her, and the Enclave had nothing to offer her. No one here could change what she\u2019d done in order to escape; no one could absolve her of that. She gripped the pestle in her fist and avoided Elzibek\u2019s gaze across the fire. Elzibek wouldn\u2019t understand. And Rana didn\u2019t want her to.\n A man trudged up the hill. As he approached the fire, his features sharpened; Kevrik worked in the gene labs and often bothered Rana for help analyzing the mods they got from EdiTech for their algae. He knelt next to Elzibek.\n \u201cThe techs have called a summit about the latest mods from EdiTech. None of the other boroughs got the mods we did, even though we all use the same algae strains. They\u2019d like to hear from you before they make their decision.\u201d\n \u201cNow?\u201d Elzibek asked. \u201cSurely this can wait until tomorrow?\u201d\n Kevrik shook his head. \u201cNoon tomorrow\u2019s the payment deadline for the mods. We\u2019re already barely keeping up with the Enclave\u2019s resource demand as it is. If we forgo these mods and our strains run into issues, then we\u2019ll have to wait months for EdiTech to release a new batch of mods. It could take years for us to recover.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s assuming EdiTech\u2019s mods are going to help the strains at all,\u201d Rana muttered under her breath.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve never gotten a mod this different before.\u201d Kevrik said, ignoring her.\n \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing our techs can do to reverse engineer it, to figure out what it does?\u201d Elzibek asked.\n \u201cNo. Our hardware isn\u2019t good enough. We\u2019ve been at it for weeks.\u201d Kevrik\u2019s eyes slid to Rana. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d She took a steadying breath. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already told you before. I can\u2019t do anything without EdiTech\u2019s gene interface.\u201d And even if the Enclave did have a sophisticated gene interface like EdiTech\u2019s, Rana wouldn\u2019t have anything more to do with engineering gene mods. At EdiTech, she had spent her waking hours plugged into their massive supercomputer network, and it had used her mind and everyone else\u2019s to churn through new gene variations. Her memories had slipped away with the hours until she remembered nothing before EdiTech except Josie. They had taken everything from her and left her drowning in fog.\n Kevrik\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cFine. Elzibek, EdiTech said they\u2019d be sending a representative tomorrow to encourage negotiations.\u201d\n \u201cThen I will be there to hear what they have to say.\u201d\n Kevrik nodded, but remained crouching next to Elzibek, fidgeting.\n \u201cYes?\u201d Elzibek fixed him with her piercing stare.\n \u201cIf you had wanted an Instar who would devote their life to protecting the interests of the Enclave, there were plenty of other options,\u201d Kevrik said.\n Rana\u2019s head snapped toward him. \u201cLike I wanted them to\u2014\u201d\n Elzibek held up a hand. \u201cThe Council always has its reasons, and the safety of the Enclave is always our first concern. We would not choose someone who would do our people harm.\u201d\n \u201cBut you would choose an outsider who doesn\u2019t even want this responsibility? I know what my choice would be,\u201d Kevrik said. \u201cDo you know what I could accomplish with an extra few hundred years? We could have a colony\u2014colonies\u2014of pollinators. Real ones, not the bots. Resilient and efficient algae strains that wouldn\u2019t require gene updates from EdiTech to meet the Enclave\u2019s demands. Infrastructure powered by the flood cycles. We could be truly self-sufficient.\u201d\n \u201cYou could do all that watching your wife outlive you and die?\u201d Rana asked, her voice low. \u201cWatching your daughters grow old, start their own families, and die? You could save the Enclave and live with all that death following you?\u201d Josie\u2019s face flashed before Rana\u2019s eyes, and her scream echoed in her ears.\n \u201cIf it would help them too, then yes.\u201d\n \u201cThen maybe the Council should choose you.\u201d\n \u201cThe Council has chosen Rana.\u201d Elzibek said. \u201cIf she declines, they will choose another. Kevrik, I will join the summit shortly.\u201d\n Kevrik shook his head and stalked back into the gloom.\n The fire dimmed to a ruby glow before either of the women spoke again.\n \u201cWhy did the Council choose me?\u201d Rana finally whispered. If the Council of Ages deemed her worthy, then maybe she could ignore the guilt that ached at the back of her skull. The mortar and pestle lay forgotten in her lap, the stone cup dusted with red.\n Elzibek rubbed her finger against her lip as she thought, smearing it with the ochre. \u201cYou know EdiTech in ways the Enclave does not; your insight and experience would be invaluable for our survival.\u201d\n \u201cYou want to use me as a weapon against EdiTech.\u201d The idea of being bound to EdiTech in such a permanent way made Rana\u2019s stomach twist in knots.\n Elzibek ignored her. \u201cWe rely on EdiTech for the algae mods that sustain our borough. We cannot produce these ourselves. And for decades, EdiTech\u2014and their president in particular\u2014has made it clear that they want access to our cicadidae mod. You can see how this puts us in a precarious situation.\u201d\n \u201cAnvar Caladon wants the mod? Does he know about the side effects?\u201d Rana asked, eying Alizar.\n \u201cHe thinks he can improve it in ways we can\u2019t. He wants the power with none of the sacrifice.\u201d Elzibek turned to Rana, her eyes as bright and piercing as the fire between them. \u201cWhat do you want, Rana?\u201d\n Rana leaned back and tipped her head toward the night sky. It glittered with stars, ships, and habs the size of small cities drifting in orbit. If she could just get there, she\u2019d be out of EdiTech\u2019s reach. People could disappear among the stars. She\u2019d never have to think about Josalin again.\n \u201cI guess\u2014\u201d She almost admitted everything. How she had gotten the two of them tangled up with EdiTech. And how her plan to untangle them had gotten Josie killed. The words quavered at the tip of her tongue, ready to leap out of her mouth and condemn her. But Elzibek could not know the whole truth. Elzibek could not absolve her of what she\u2019d done, and Rana would not let her try. The Enclave wanted her for itself, and she would not let it sink its claws into her. \u201cI just want to be safe.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a total lie, but she knew she\u2019d never be truly safe.\n Elzibek\u2019s eyes lingered on the horizon where the EdiTech facility glowed like the setting sun. \u201cWe all want to be safe. Even Caladon in his fortress.\u201d\n Rana laughed bitterly. \u201cHe\u2019s nothing like the rest of us.\u201d\n \u201cAlizar and I and the rest of the Instars are nothing like everyone else,\u201d Elzibek said. \u201cIf you accept the mod, you won\u2019t be either.\u201d\n Rana\u2019s curiosity got the best of her. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d\n \u201cIt changes you, just like any mod. You don\u2019t notice the effects for a while, but eventually you see people change around yourself, faster than you\u2019re changing. You blink and those people are gone, replaced by new faces. And after many years, many decades, you start to notice that your own mods aren\u2019t as fresh as they once were.\u201d Elzibek wasn\u2019t looking at Rana anymore; she stared into the fire and the flames burned in her eyes. \u201cThe mod is a dam holding back time. And eventually time starts leaking through the cracks.\u201d\n \u201cWhat made you do it?\u201d Maybe Elzibek really was as selfless as she pretended to be. Or perhaps she was running from something too.\n Elzibek turned her attention back to Alizar. \u201cWhen I was seven, the storms came weeks earlier than the forecasts predicted. They hit hard and fast, and within a day, they had wiped the Enclave out to the plains. My family was gone.\u201d Elzibek scrubbed her red hands on her threadbare cloak, and her voice faltered. \u201cEveryone rebuilt. I begged them to move the Enclave out of the valley, but they said the Enclave had always been here, and here it would stay. And look around, Rana. We\u2019re still in this valley. People carried on with their lives, but how could I? I asked to join the Council. I am the reason the Enclave has been rebuilt to withstand the storms. I am the reason the Enclave thrives even as the floods worsen. But my family is still gone. And so it is my burden to remember the past. My family was a sacrifice\u2014the catalyst for transformation. I was a sacrifice of a different sort. We all make sacrifices, Rana.\u201d\n Rana knew plenty about sacrifice. She didn\u2019t want any more. EdiTech had smothered her in a silk cocoon, and she would not stay in the Enclave and let them transform her into a different sort of unnatural creature. Just a few more days, and then the storms would come. And if she were lucky, the rain would wash away the Enclave and all of EdiTech with it.\n Rana started awake when a blue mote lit up the corner of her vision\u2014a comms message. Hopefully it was the Council rescinding their offer.\n \u201cAnvar Caladon is coming for you tomorrow.\u201d\n The message sent a shock through her body. No sender listed. Her implants didn\u2019t even seem to recognize the sender\u2019s system. It couldn\u2019t be real.\n She closed her eyes, focusing fully on the message. Calling up all accessible metadata, she melted into the message\u2019s code, just like syncing with her swarm.\n A string of data twisted in front of her, and she latched on, following it until she arrived at the sender\u2019s identification code.\n \u201cRana, run.\u201d\n Rana\u2019s heart fluttered. It was impossible\u2014\n \u201cJosalin?\u201d Rana whispered. \u201cJosie?\u201d It couldn\u2019t be her sister. She sent a pulse through the line to the sender, just a questioning ping.\n \u201cDelivery error: recipient not found,\u201d flashed across her vision. Rana searched through the metadata again, but the sender and the messages were gone. Her heart hammered in her chest.\n It couldn\u2019t be Josalin. She\u2019d seen the flash that had knocked her to the ground. No one got up after those pulses.\n But Rana had seen the sender\u2019s ID code. Josie\u2019s genes were stitched into that ID and only death would render it inactive. EdiTech had gotten her sister, and now Anvar Caladon was coming to the Enclave to get her too.\n Rana made it to the hive console just after midnight. She couldn\u2019t leave the Enclave if the messages were genuine. She had to find Josie.\n Settling down at the main console, Rana fitted the hive interface to her temples. When she opened her eyes, the swarm opened theirs. With a mental nudge, the bots burst into life with whirring wings and swirled out into the Enclave.\n She sent the nano-bees out across the valley in waves and kept a handful buzzing around her head. If a convoy came from EdiTech to the Enclave, she would see it.\n The dark landscape sped past as the swarm dispersed. Soon, the sleek, curving form of the EdiTech facility filled her vision a hundred times as her bots approached the compound. Her pulse raced. There, just outside the walls, she had lost Josalin. But maybe Josie wasn\u2019t lost forever.\n As Rana monitored the valley through the other nano-bees in her swarm, she noticed an armored EdiTech vehicle headed toward the Enclave. It would be there by morning. If she left the Enclave now, she could disappear before the convoy arrived.\n But she couldn\u2019t leave Josie. Not again. Rana drew close the cluster of bots around her head until she could feel their needle-sharp appendages pricking her scalp. Closer still she drew them, until their feelers found the remnants of the EdiTech implants still woven through her flesh. There were hardly any cracks in EdiTech\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. But Rana had thousands of bots and all night to look. Her swarm buried deeper\u2014into the facility and into herself\u2014as she searched for Josie\u2019s signal.\n A fine mist of bots swirled through EdiTech all night. Accessing an air handler here, sneaking under doors there. Her head throbbed, but she pushed the bots farther, searching for anything left of the signal she remembered.\n There.\n As the sun stretched over the horizon, the bots detected Josie\u2014not from smell, and not from the message signature, but from something that was both and neither at the same time\u2014just ahead.\n Her swarm raged.\n Rana tore the hive interface from her face. Her mind buzzed with anger and the nano-bees that still clung to her old implants.\n Josie had been there all along.\n The daylight burned her eyes, but she could still see through her swarm even with the interface removed. She could still guide them.\n She had abandoned Josie.\n Rana strode through the Enclave, half-seeing, half-sensing through her swarm, while the bots deep inside EdiTech surged forward to find her sister. At the west gate, the EdiTech convoy had parked just outside the borough. Guards flanked the vans.\n Anvar Caladon stood at the Enclave\u2019s walls. With his dark hair slicked back to a sheen and his clothes fitting him perfectly\u2014tailored for him alone with no signs of mends or tears\u2014Anvar Caladon looked like he had stepped out of the ads that flooded the refugee comm channels. Deep in an argument with Kevrik and Elzibek, he hadn\u2019t seen Rana yet.\n \u201cEnough, Caladon.\u201d Kevrik\u2019s harsh voice broke through the buzzing that echoed in Rana\u2019s ears. \u201cWe\u2019ve made our decision.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure? The other boroughs know your Instar mods are failing. The Enclave\u2019s prestige is slipping through your fingers. Don\u2019t you want me to fix it? Don\u2019t you want to truly live forever, like gods?\u201d\n \u201cWe are not gods, Caladon.\u201d Elzibek joined Kevrik at the gate.\n \u201cBut we could be. With the minds I could apply to the mod, it\u2019d be perfect in no time.\u201d\n Rana knew the minds he was talking about. She had been one of those minds. And Josie was still one of those minds, if not something even worse.\n Rana pushed past Kevrik and Elzibek and spoke as recognition crystallized across Caladon\u2019s face. \u201cI know about Josalin.\u201d\n Caladon\u2019s eyes darted from the rips in Rana\u2019s clothes to the silver bots that circled her head and lingered on the tufts of hair that Elzibek had hacked short to get at her implants. He smiled. \u201cAh, the other reason for my visit. Instar Elzibek, it seems you are harboring a known criminal.\u201d\n Elzibek barely glanced at Rana before she spoke. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a criminal by our laws.\u201d\n \u201cNo? She is by EdiTech\u2019s. Don\u2019t you remember, Rana? A life for a life?\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t kill anyone,\u201d Rana said.\n \u201cNot the way EdiTech sees it. Our gene mods are life. It\u2019s not a technicality to us. And you thought you could destroy a whole batch of them, years of work\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014your mods are dirty\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014and then abscond with EdiTech property\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014Josalin,\u201d Rana shouted, squeezing her eyes shut tight. \u201cHer name is Josalin. She wasn\u2019t your property.\u201d\n \u201cEnough of her was.\u201d\n Rana sent the swarm forward toward Josie. Except\u2014something was wrong. Josie wasn\u2019t here. There was nothing here. The swarm explored the space deep within EdiTech\u2019s walls, their thrumming building into a roar. They weren\u2019t in a room; they were in a locker full of wires and bloodied tubes. It smelled of flesh. Searching for Josie\u2019s signal, Rana commanded the bots deeper into her skull, maximizing their connection with her implants.\n But there was nothing else.\n All that was left of Josalin sat there before her swarming eyes, an unrecognizable knot of metal and oozing tissue, blinking, and stuck with wires.\n This couldn\u2019t be right. Rana couldn\u2019t make sense of it, not with her head aching and her mind split among all her swarm\u2019s silvery minds. The swarm around her head whirled in a frenzy.\n Josie had been dead, then alive, and now something else. Rana was powerless to re-form her or make her whole again. EdiTech had done this to her. And Rana couldn\u2019t undo it, but she could end it.\n \u201cI know what you did to her. I found her.\u201d Trembling, Rana sent her bots tearing through the space in a buzzing cloud of silver and gore. The cold, hard taste of metal filled her mouth as blood oozed from her scalp and smeared with her tears. She sank to her knees.\n Josie was gone.\n Caladon\u2019s eyes darted, dismissing a notification. Then they glinted, hard and cold like a knife. \u201cThere was once EdiTech in you, too.\u201d He crouched in front of Rana and, in an instant, grasped her skull between his hands. Bots trapped beneath his fingers wriggled as they wormed deeper into her implants, sending lances of pain through her head. \u201cPerhaps we should crack you open and see how much is left.\u201d\n The buzzing grew to deafening levels, drowning out Elzibek\u2019s and Kevrik\u2019s shouts as the EdiTech guards closed in around them. Images from the nano-bees ghosted atop the Enclave\u2014herself surrounded by her swarm, Josalin dead again and again, Anvar Caladon looming in front of her.\n Rana took a breath, pulling the air deep into her lungs and holding it there. She wished she could stay like this\u2014forever on the precipice, never jumping.\n Hidden between moments.\n Safe.\n Caladon had told her she\u2019d be safe if she stayed at EdiTech. If she ran, they would find her. She would end up like Josie. He had told her with a smile that bared all his teeth that she could stay at EdiTech even after everything she had done. They\u2019d halve her debt. His teeth had gleamed like ivory in the moonlight, and his fingers, red with Josie\u2019s blood, had reached toward her. EdiTech would help her. EdiTech was family. Bile rose in her throat.\n Rana squeezed her eyes shut and exhaled. Though her head ached to the point she thought it would split, she sank into her swarm once more and threw them toward Caladon. The bots danced as they covered him from crown to shoulders, humming and vibrating and stinging in a single mass. As he howled and clawed at them, Rana staggered to her feet. Adrenaline pounded through her veins, and her hands left bloody smears on the earth.\n \u201cYou showed Josie no mercy.\u201d\n She stopped. Wondered if this was the right thing to do. Anguish flooded all parts of her fractured mind, even the parts inside the silver bots that attacked Caladon as if it would make a difference. As if it would bring Josie back.\n But the smallest part of Rana, the part left inside her head when the rest of her fled to the swarm, knew that it wouldn\u2019t.\n \u201cAnvar Caladon, I will show you mercy. A life for a life. My debt is repaid.\u201d\n She couldn\u2019t have done that a month ago. She couldn\u2019t do it again. She wasn\u2019t sure if she could live with her choice at all.\n The nano-bees retreated to swirl around her head in lazy orbits, leaving Caladon gasping for breath. Under the morning sun, her swarm glinted like stars.\n Rana followed Elzibek down the stone steps that spiraled into the earth beneath the crypt hall. A cool, damp breeze fluttered up as they descended, and in the dim light from Elzibek\u2019s lantern, the stairs could have gone down forever. A dull pain throbbed in her head, and her stomach churned with nausea.\n Josie was gone.\n The steps opened into a cave with walls pocked like honeycomb. Some cells were filled, and others gaped with hungry maws. Red handprints reached out of the cells and climbed to the ceiling. Elzibek guided Rana onto a bench that ran along the wall. She removed a small canister from her pocket, and when she opened it, Rana recognized the smell.\n \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Her voice had lost its usual sternness. Elzibek dipped her fingers into the canister and daubed the red paste along Rana\u2019s temples where her wounds had clotted and scabbed. Warmth spread across her scalp.\n Rana ached. She couldn\u2019t leave the Enclave. EdiTech would never let her escape across the plains, no matter how high the floods rose. After what she had done, Caladon would snatch her up if she so much as stretched a finger outside the Enclave\u2019s protective walls. She had nowhere to run. And it didn\u2019t matter. Home had died with her memories and again with Josalin. She would never be home again. Josie was gone. And still Elzibek only worried about the cicadidae mod.\n \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d\n \u201cTo help you.\u201d\n \u201cYou think this is going to help me? You think this is going to bring my sister back or keep me safe from EdiTech?\u201d Rana\u2019s voice echoed in the cave, shouting back at her.\n \u201cNo.\u201d Elzibek looked away from Rana. The lantern splashed gold in the creases that bloomed across her face. She gestured at an empty cell on the opposite wall. \u201cWhen my gene mods falter, this is where they\u2019ll pack me into the dirt and let the mycelium keep me alive until my mods stabilize. If I\u2019m lucky.\u201d\n The red paste\u2019s earthy smell wafted down from Rana\u2019s forehead, and she shivered. \u201cCaladon really thinks being a god is worth this?\u201d\n \u201cThose with power have always wanted to become gods no matter the cost. They forget that a god\u2019s duty is to serve. Caladon will never understand that. We are nothing more than hostages from the past, representing the interests of those who have yet to come.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you think the mod is worth all this too?\u201d\n \u201cThe earth has given us the mod as it is. We have changed her,\u201d Elzibek said as she closed the canister and tucked it away. \u201cAnd so we must change in return.\u201d\n Rana swallowed against the lump in her throat. Josie whispered in her ear, telling her to run. Josie\u2019s voice always had sounded just like hers. \u201cI want to leave. I\u2014I don\u2019t want this.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not something that you should want,\u201d Elzibek said, shaking her head. \u201cTo accept this mod is to give up yourself. To become something no longer\u2014\u201d she paused. Rolled a strand of gray hair between her fingertips. \u201c\u2014human.\u201d Her whisper echoed in the cavern. \u201cBut everything changes. Stone transforms. Even the true void stretches and yields with time. To be stagnant is to be unnatural. Sacrifice is transformation, and transformation is life. Come,\u201d Elzibek said, leading Rana from the crypt.\n They continued down the stone steps in silence, deeper and deeper, until the stairs opened into a cavern. Twisting formations covered the walls and reached down toward Rana from above. In front of them, a pool, inky and flat, yawned into the distance past the reaches of Elzibek\u2019s lamp.\n \u201cThis is why the Enclave remains in the valley,\u201d Elzibek whispered. She flicked off her lamp and darkness swallowed the cavern. As Rana\u2019s eyes adjusted, the dark yielded to pinpricks of silver that wandered on the pool\u2019s surface. An Elzibek-shaped shadow knelt at the pool, and a gentle ripple sent the glimmers dancing. The shadow stood.\n \u201cYou\u2019ll own nothing. Have no family. You won\u2019t rule. You won\u2019t be a hero.\u201d Elzibek approached Rana and pressed a cold vial into her hand. \u201cWe are at the mercy of those who live and die faster than the briefest flash of lightning. If you do not act in their best interest, they will bury you and never dig you up.\u201d Elzibek was invisible in the darkness, but sorrow dripped from every word. \u201cYou will live with the consequences of your choices for centuries. With the blame. The guilt. But this is how we transcend. This is how we transform. This is what the cicadidae mod can offer you.\u201d\n Rana couldn\u2019t speak. She couldn\u2019t live like that. She already had too much guilt inside raging like a blinding storm.\n \u201cTake it, or do not. It is your choice. It did not bring my family back, and it will not bring your sister back. But sacrifice can bring purpose. It can bring relief. But like all true sacrifices, it cannot be undone.\u201d\n Rana pocketed the vial and followed Elzibek out of the cavern. They climbed up and up and out of the earth. The vial tapped at Rana with every step.\n The setting sun painted the horizon pink, and clouds threaded the sky like gossamer. Rana sat at the hive console at the edge of the Enclave, facing out toward the plains with the lights of EdiTech at her back. Her head throbbed even though her swarm slept soundly in their hives. Frogs called out to the rains, sensing them just beyond the curve of the horizon. Rana wormed her fingers into the dirt.\n She\u2019d never be free of her guilt. Even if she slogged to the neighboring borough through months of the heaviest storms. Even if she lost herself in a hab thousands of miles beyond EdiTech\u2019s reach. She turned the vial end over end. The guilt would seep into her bones and haunt her for the rest of her life. Exhaustion settled over her like shroud, and a sob scratched its way out of her throat.\n Maybe Elzibek was right, and the mod would bring relief. Rana had already sacrificed so much, but she could endure one more. A sacrifice to atone for all she\u2019d done. One final sacrifice to fill the void that Josie\u2019s absence left in her chest.\n She\u2019d sleep down in her crypt, breathing the dirt, while the heavens wheeled around her. She\u2019d face Anvar Caladon again and again. It wouldn\u2019t matter how deep he buried her. She\u2019d claw her way out of the earth and challenge him as long as he lived.\n For hundreds of years.\n Elzibek would get the weapon she wanted after all.\n Rana lifted the vial\u2019s cap to reveal the injector and placed the thin, silvery needle against her skin.\n She let it sting.\n Meghan Feldman grew up in rural southern Maryland.

She moved to the UK in 1993. \u201cWhether I\u2019m flying to Guangzhou, or to London, they both feel like coming home, but also tinged with the sadness when leaving.\u201d\n Coming from a family of businesspeople, Xueting fought to follow a path focused on literature. \u201cI guess my dilemma was that of many diaspora Chinese and East Asians, who are simply expected to go into IT, finance, sciences, or at least something sensible, like the professions.\u201d She earned a BA in English at Queen Mary\u2019s University of London, then moved to Beijing to study Chinese literature. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to restrict myself to single topics, and I really felt like half my education was going to be in experiencing local life and seeing China\u2019s diversity. So, I sort of stepped away from those places that were set up for students from the West, found a flat in the Haidian District, and ended up cobbling together a postgrad medley at Minzu University (Central University of Nationalities), where I could look at the cornerstones and classics, but also literature and film, cultural studies. It gave me a chance to really get a sense of how China sees itself, and how those views are changing. How they celebrate their diversity inside, but still present this single face of China outside.\u201d\n For over a decade, Xueting has worked in publishing as her day job, doing everything from assisting a literary agent, to contracts and legal, and finally, settling in production. \u201cAny time I found myself between contracts, I\u2019d just pick up what I could, like tutoring a teenager in Chinese and piano, probably the weirdest job was picking parts for jet planes for an electronics company.\u201d For just as long, she has also been doing translation work, functioning as an interpreter, and promoting Chinese culture in her own time. Her translations cover a spectrum of material, such as best-selling manhua Vision of the Other Side by Lin Yu-Chin; prose, poetry, and art collection Endless by Professor Sherman Lin; indie music documentary \u201cChina Underground\u201d by John Yingling; Chinese science fiction by Tang Fei; and more. She has also spent years writing nonfiction, including pieces for the BBC, the Guangdong Academy of Fine Arts, and From Kuan Yin to Chairman Mao: The Essential Guide to Chinese Deities (Weiser Books), as well as giving talks and tours.\n Xueting currently lives in the suburbs of London with her partner and their cats, all of whom are learning Chinese. Besides literature, she is passionate about film, food, and music of many kinds. \u201cI find myself increasingly reading for my education, both research and understanding how the world is changing around me. Nowadays, I often dream of just reading for pleasure. My TBR pile is rather a large and ominous creature.\u201d\n How did you get into genre fiction and science fiction in particular? What were some of the first science fiction books or stories that spoke to you, and why?\n I came to genre fiction relatively late. As a kid in China, I was given children\u2019s science books rather than science fiction, but there was a copy of Alexander Belyaev\u2019s Professor Dowell\u2019s Head on the bookshelf at home, which I dipped into. I was probably too young for it, but it left an impression.\n Even after we emigrated to the UK, I was still raised as the \u201cgood Chinese child\u201d and given a steady diet of literary classics, so I guess my first science fiction stories were the ones that were canon enough to wind up on my English Literature degree\u2019s syllabus. Mary Shelley, R. L. Stevenson, Orwell, and Huxley. Frankenstein, along with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, really stood out for me. They combined science, horror, as well as humanist and sociological debate, all delivered in the elegant and sophisticated vehicle of the Victorian novel.\n University also introduced me to all kinds of people. Goths, queer kids, anime nerds . . . and that\u2019s when I came into contact with more pop culture stuff, especially the genre fiction that I\u2019ve loved ever since. I started working my way forward from \u201cthe classics.\u201d The unfettered imagination and lyricism of Bradbury; the charming robot stories of Asimov; the incredible worlds and intensity of P. K. D., whose influences went beyond Western cultures. I came to love the work of John Wyndham, who to me, is the quintessential British science fiction writer, he\u2019s very insightful with an understated grace and economy to his work. I\u2019m very aware that this list is predominantly old, male, and white, but these were the most readily available and visible works during my youth. At the moment, I\u2019m having an amazing time catching up on the works by writers of color like myself and especially female writers.\n In one of your blog posts you mention that horror is one of your favorite genres. What is it that horror and science fiction do that non-genre fiction doesn\u2019t?\n Ghost stories always seemed to be around. I grew up with adaptations of Pu Songling\u2019s collection. He was a scholar from the 17th/18th century, and his work still inspires authors around the world today.\n I\u2019ve always been interested in what societies fear, or are afraid to face, and these elements absolutely feed into horror fiction. There\u2019s been a slow shift in China from the supernatural to body and social horror, and I think that says a lot about how the society is developing, but both horror and science fiction are these unfettered spaces for creative imagining. As someone who used to be immersed in realist and contemporary classics, I\u2019m awed by how many more tools science fiction and horror give you to work with, and the freedom to create your own. It enables the writer to explore themes in a more intense, heightened way.\n To me the boundaries between genre, non-genre, \u201cliterary,\u201d and \u201cpopular\u201d fiction aren\u2019t so clear cut, or that important. There are well written works in any style and genre that should be celebrated.\n What are some of the most important differences between newer Chinese science fiction (from the past few years) and older or classic Chinese science fiction?\n The big difference? The people who write them. During China\u2019s first \u201cgolden age\u201d of science fiction, writers were charged with \u201cthe education of the general public\u201d through their stories, which meant that the authors tended to be professors and teachers, portraying technological utopias. From the 1980s onward, there\u2019s been a diversification from the collective social experience, and writers of the last few decades are exploring a lot of different subjects, such as body modification, space exploration, enhanced and artificial intelligence, the use and misuse of technology, ecological concerns . . . kehuan (Chinese for science fiction) has progressed from a linear development to an explosion of activity. We are now also seeing more writers emerging from diverse backgrounds and experiences. In terms of elements like style, narrative form, and point of view, the genre has become a lot more dynamic.\n Do you have favorite science fiction, fantasy, or horror writers whose work still hasn\u2019t been translated into English, authors that Western audiences may not even know about?\n Lots. Science fiction is an area that China is very much focusing on right now, with lots of recognition of it as a thing in its own right, and there\u2019s more of a concerted effort to bring works out to the wider world. Not so much other genres . . . yet. I\u2019ve been looking into China\u2019s flourishing genre fiction output, and this century, it\u2019s really taken off. The rise of digital publishing has meant that a lot more fantastic writers have been able to get themselves read, and with increased competition and growing readerships spurring writers on, the improvement of quality has been quite something. This has led to a plethora of new genres too, such as daomu (tomb raiding), danmei (Chinese BL), qihuan (fantasy that combines Western and Eastern elements). Ten years ago, hardly any of these writers would have been known in the West, so it\u2019s very pleasing that at least some of the more recent ones, people over here have at least heard of, or seen adapted on TV and film. Sorry to be vague, I\u2019m in discussions with various people about future projects at the moment.\n How did the Sinopticon project come about, how did it develop, and what were the biggest challenges to making it happen?\n I actually first worked on translations about fifteen years ago. I am a literary translator, but also a geek, and I saw huge and important cultural content coming out in storytelling forms such as manhua (graphic novels), contemporary fiction, and genre fiction. At the time, most of the translators in the UK were Western academics, and there was a baked-in belief that non-Western translators somehow could not do quite as thorough a job of localization. There were certain limited perspectives through which the media and Anglophone publishers were willing to see China. If the book wasn\u2019t about the hardships of recent Chinese history or the majesty of ancient wonders, they just weren\u2019t that interested.\n Publishers and literary agents at the time could probably just about accept a translator who was ethnically Chinese, as long as they had been born and raised in an Anglophone country. But being a Chinese immigrant who\u2019d spent a childhood in China and the rest of my life in the UK, someone who wanted to translate Chinese works into English without even having a master\u2019s or PhD in oriental studies . . . well, they didn\u2019t quite know what to make of me.\n So, I was left seeing these huge, important cultural touchstones hurtling past, unregarded, unable to gain any attention for these amazing projects. It was infuriating, but I continued to write about China, and its culture, and build up the recognition for my writing and knowledge, as well as my lectures and talks on Chinese film, music, and yes, its popular literature, \u2018til I gained enough momentum that opportunities arose.\n Sinopticon had been bubbling in my head for years, having browsed through excellent sci-fi magazines on the newsstand during my trips to China, and being very aware that the people in the UK had absolutely no idea this stuff even existed. When Worldcon came to London in 2014, I was able to attend thanks to a group called Con or Bust, who lobby for convention tickets to help young people of color, who may otherwise not be able to access the circuit. There, I had some serendipitous meetings with Chinese SF writers, and even ended up helping out on the China bid stand, along with my editor. After that, I read more kehuan online, delivered a lecture on it, and had another fortuitous meeting with people from Rebellion, who I managed to get enthusiastic about the project. It\u2019s only taken me about ten years to get someone to listen to me.\n Did the book turn out pretty much how you\u2019d initially envisioned it? Or are there important differences between initial concept and final product?\n Once I actually got the project green-lit, there was the issue of story selection. There are few channels for translators from outside China to connect with authors, and traversing platforms like Weibo isn\u2019t quite as simple as dropping someone a DM on Twitter. Luckily, I had already met Regina Kanyu Wang, who introduced me to Storycom, and that was an excellent bridge. They have been very helpful in getting me in touch with, not only the authors registered with them, but other writers I\u2019d had my eye on. Between that, my trips to China, and sifting through works on the Internet, I had to work quite quickly to pin down not just a handful of excellent stories, but ones that would work together to help represent the range of styles and subject matter present in contemporary Chinese science fiction.\n You could say I felt limited by time (publishing schedule) and space (word limit). I wanted to bring in the wider context. So, for this first anthology, I wanted to present some older writers who started to publish at the very beginning of the current kehuan revival, as well as stories which had only just been published in China. There were more writers I wanted to include, and more still I heard about and read during the book\u2019s production process. I think I\u2019m always going to feel I haven\u2019t looked through enough works, or included a broad enough range, partly because those channels of exchange are still limited, but also because Chinese SF publishing has been rapidly expanding, with stories published not only in print and magazines, but online, on both literary platforms and social media. At the end of the day, it was more important to focus on the quality of the translation and editing, and on putting the thirteen works together so that Anglophone readers would have another portal into kehuan in English, to enjoy and hopefully, fire their desire to read more.\n I had envisioned working with one particular Chinese illustrator, whom I had worked with before, but due to timing, he was unavailable. I\u2019m exceptionally glad he\u2019s that in demand, and I do think that the artist we ended up using has turned out some fantastic cover art. Another thing I\u2019m really pleased with is the story guides I\u2019ve written to go with each story. My editor suggested that since the collection spans the past thirty years, and comes from such a different science fiction tradition, that I should put some context to them. I loved the idea, as the bulk of what I do is nonfiction cultural and sociocultural writing. However, I didn\u2019t want to influence the reader\u2019s view of the story before they discovered it for themselves, so we put the guides at the end of each work. I was inspired by my second edition of Octavia E. Butler\u2019s Kindred and Other Stories. One of the objectives I went in to Sinopticon with was to help platform women kehuan authors, who are notoriously underrepresented in China. I was worried that if I chose a wholly female lineup, it would feel like a marginalized space, so I worked toward having an even split, just mainly looking at stories based on content and compatibility, and I\u2019d ended up with women\u2019s voices in over half of the works, as well as a wonderful foreword by another female writer.\n Are there elements that tie these stories together? Were there specific things you were looking for in your selection process? Or could this be seen as something of a \u201cBest Of\u201d anthology?\n There weren\u2019t really any criteria beyond \u201cAre the authors Chinese? Are they writing what could be called science fiction? Do I think it is well written and enjoyable?\u201d I\u2019m an eclectic reader, so a wide range appeals to me, and I loved how broad the subject matters I found were, from time travel, genetic modification, and historical trauma, to political segregation, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. All those things are pretty common in SF, but the way they were employed to explore art, terrorism, even burial rites . . . made for an interesting selection. I\u2019m not sure I could claim it\u2019s a Best Of\u201d anthology, but definitely an \u201cExceptionally Fine Collection From.\u201d As I\u2019ve said, the amount of new content turning up daily . . . I wanted to capture at least a snapshot of how this vibrant writing scene is tackling a society headed into the future with its foot on the accelerator.\n Due to my own experiences, I always want to give voice to the marginalized, so some of the writers included are perhaps ones that haven\u2019t received a lot of recognition in English, whilst I also needed to tempt in some of the more well-known names, to get people to pick the book up in the first place.\n However, having now gone through this process once, and being better acquainted with the Chinese SF industry, I can be a lot more hands on in digging out the rough gems and bringing them to the world when the appropriate opportunities arise.\n Were there stories that you really liked, but that didn\u2019t end up in the anthology?\n There certainly were. I had really wanted to feature a piece by Xia Jia, but whilst I was building this collection, she was making her own selection for A Summer Beyond Your Reach. However, I\u2019m delighted to have her involvement in another part of this book. There were also works from Han Song and Hao Jingfang, which were made up of multiple parts, which I absolutely fell in love with on first reading. I think they would have been amazing and really fun to translate. However, they were far too long for an anthology, and whilst I could have included single sections from them, it just didn\u2019t feel right. Of course, there were authors like Chi Hui, Qi Yue, and others, whom I\u2019ve had a chance to explore more since the manuscript was handed in, and I clasped my head thinking \u201cOH! Why didn\u2019t I try to include these stories!\u201d but I don\u2019t think I could have included everyone I wanted without the book turning into a multivolume monstrosity.\n If someone will read only one story to see if the book is for them, which story would you tell them to read\u2014and why?\n That\u2019s a very difficult question, and I\u2019m not sure a fair one! They are all such different stories, and so not really comparable. I do have my personal favorites, but I\u2019d say just pick a story whose title you like and go for it.\n Science fiction can challenge readers in different ways. Which story in the anthology challenges the reader the most?\n Several stories in the collection are definitely challenging, in different ways, and I do discuss this in my notes. \u201cThe Absolution Experiment\u201d confronts difficult subjects, such as terrorism and the nature of justice, while \u201cThe Tide of Moon City\u201d makes us think about the impact on everyday lives by geopolitical separatist disputes; and \u201cThe Return of Adam\u201d challenges Confucianism as a paradigm of being Chinese. \u201cRendezvous: 1937\u201d is not at all a comfortable read, but it\u2019s important to think about, and remember, that period of history. The atrocities which were inflicted on China haven\u2019t been covered as much as they need to be, and I feel that more people need to be made aware and to understand it.\n A fair amount of Western science fiction gets translated for Chinese language markets. Do some of the stories in Sinopticon stand in conversation with Western, Chinese, or other science fictional narratives in important ways?\n Modern China is a very outward looking place. Whether it\u2019s indie music or literature, creators take influences from around the world. A lot of the older generations have grown up reading classic Anglophone science fiction, which I get a feeling of in the tone of their works. One of the reasons I instantly found an affinity with the last story of the collection, is that it reminded me of the whimsy, humor, and wit of British science fiction, like as Douglas Adams and Doctor Who, both of which I am a huge fan of. The more literal translation of the work\u2019s title is \u201cThe Bookshop at the End of the Universe,\u201d and there are a few elements in it which are totally a love letter to the Hitchhiker\u2019s cycle. I didn\u2019t think the wibbly-wobbly quirkiness and humor in these works would translate well into other cultures, but it seems that the Doctor Who fandom in China is so large that the BBC ended up commissioning some great official art for the China merch, and one of the things that the zhai, or geeky circles, are talking about at the moment is a range of figurines inspired by Frankie and Benjy mouse, the pan dimensional beings who turned up in the first Hitchhiker\u2019s series.\n After some consideration and discussion with the author, we decided to give it a different title rather than a direct translation\u2014\u201cStarship: Library,\u201d was closer to the essence of the story. Whilst it has a lot of callbacks to that sort of . . . post-Python British sci-fi humor, it retains its roots in Chinese culture, reinterpreting one of Chinese mythology\u2019s neglected goddesses as the world\u2019s savior.\n A lot of the younger writers like A Que, have, like fans around the world, honed their skills in fan fiction, but where that conversation goes is the interesting part. His story, set in a zombie pandemic, has lots of little conversations with Max Brooks\u2019 World War Z, especially in its film version. The zombie, or sangshi story is a quite recent genre in China (not to be confused with hopping jiangshi, which are China\u2019s traditional undead monsters), and has grown completely out of exposure to Western zombie fiction. A Que does some very interesting things with the sangshi in his work, while at the same time breaking the fourth wall and engaging in dialogue with the common tropes of Hollywood cinema. It\u2019s a very good example of Chinese storytelling\u2019s ability to mix humor, action, and tragedy, not just on the same page, but often in the same paragraph.\n On your website, you talk about \u201cseeking out works by new emerging voices, that may be passed over by more conservative news agencies and publishers.\u201d Who are some of the new and emerging voices that excite you most, and why?\n I\u2019ve spoken a little bit about this in answer to the question about how Sinopticon came about. Now that I\u2019m in a better position to highlight them, I am at least able to write about them, so they don\u2019t completely pass global audiences by. What I\u2019m excited about most are the net novelists who are creating works, in hundreds of new genres, the freedom it\u2019s giving female writers to venture into previously male-dominated literary realms and create female-orientated writing . . . I would love to be able to translate some of these authors, or write about them more, but a lot of it depends on whether Anglophone publishers and platforms are willing to see potential in these diverse works, the importance for translators of color to represent their own heritage and be prepared to provide adequate resources to enable the work.\n In your Publishers Weekly interview, you talk a bit about gatekeeping in the world of translation publishing, and a belief that non-Western translators would not do as good a job as Western translators. What are the best ways for editors and publishers to break this cycle, especially given that many editors may not speak the original languages of the work(s) in question?\n I think there needs to be a huge, top-down, and institutional change of attitudes in the Anglophone publishing world. To be less Western-centric, to recognize that it\u2019s important for translators of color, of whatever ethnicity, to be able to work on titles from their own cultural heritage. It\u2019s their right, and not an optional approach or magnanimous decision, to allow them to be part of presenting that culture to the world. I don\u2019t mean, at all, that translators can\u2019t work on texts from other cultures. In fact, the whole point of translating is to help people discover works beyond their own traditions. But there\u2019s no excuse, when translating a writer whose work focuses on the culture or history of their ethnic origin, or when commissioning an opera or play that draws heavily from a non-Western culture, to not recruit at least some translators, actors, or consultants that represent that diversity, because there\u2019s \u201cnone good enough.\u201d Often the talent they need is not visible because the pool from which the selection is made pre-excludes them.\n I believe, especially when dealing with monumental works from a literary tradition other than their own, Western translators might just need to show some humility, step back, and acknowledge that, brilliant as they may be, it\u2019s not really appropriate for them to be the umpteenth white person turning out yet another version of this work, and maybe someone whose heritage it is could bring more to the piece. There is often this backlash from the white establishment who complain about discrimination, which can act as this awful silencer, but if you are trying to be heard, sometimes it\u2019s not \u2018til you\u2019re screaming that you can\u2019t be ignored. But in truth, if you want a wider, more diverse scope of writing, you don\u2019t just need more writers and translators of color, you need more commissioning editors, department heads, and executives of color.\n Is there anything else you\u2019d really like readers to know about Sinopticon, the authors and their stories, or yourself and your work?\n I\u2019ve always said, if you want to find out more about a nation\u2019s fears and dreams, read their science fiction. Lots of social issues have emerged over the last couple of decades of China\u2019s development, for instance, innovative high-tech solutions to these are part of the preoccupations of Chinese authors today. The book isn\u2019t just about these ideas, it sheds light on the current state of China, its people, and society. It\u2019s interesting to ponder on the fate of those who die in space, and how they are memorialized, but . . . it\u2019s a little sadder to think about what happens when a migrant worker dies on the other side of a vast country like China from their hometown. It\u2019s interesting to think about the informational arms race of enhanced intelligence, but a little close to the bone when you are considering what extra classes, societies, and nutritional supplements you need to impose on your child to prepare them for an exceptionally competitive job market in the future. Whilst a lot of the themes explored are universal, I think there is definitely an element of Sinopticon which is about translating China.\n Are you working on more projects like this one? What else do you have coming up that readers should know about?\n Give me a break please! I\u2019ve lived and breathed this book for the past two years, and have finally got it ready to go to press. I have plenty of ideas for both fiction collections, nonfiction writings, and I have an essay on new Chinese fiction platforms in the Tordotcom collection The Way Spring Arrives, which will be out in March next year, but I think I want to take a little bit of time to reconnect with friends and family before I go back into the cocoon for my next book.\n Arley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

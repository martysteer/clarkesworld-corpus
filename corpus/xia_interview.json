She speaks fast, as if she has to cram an unusual number of syllables into each unit of time to keep up with the speed of her thoughts. In the middle of one of our chats she informed me that she had to run because she needed to make it to the taping of a TV show before coming back later to deliver a special lecture on the history of Chinese science fiction to a packed auditorium. In addition, that night she needed to prepare a semester\u2019s worth of PowerPoint slides for classes she teaches at Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University.\n I wondered whether she was in possession of Hermione Granger\u2019s Time-Turner.\n Xia Jia published her first short story, \u201cThe Demon-Enslaving Flask,\u201d in 2004 (English translation by Linda Rui Feng in the November 2012 issue of Renditions), when she was still a college student. The story, a retcon science history in which Maxwell\u2019s demon was a literal demon instead of a thought experiment, catapulted its author into the limelight by winning her a Yinhe (Galaxy) Award for Best New Writer. At the same time, the story, which was published in the \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d section of Science Fiction World, China\u2019s biggest SF magazine, \u201cspawned a series of heated debates about how (and whether) we should blur (or further defend) the boundary between science fiction and other genres,\u201d says Xia Jia.\n Exploring the twilight frontier between worlds would become a constant theme in Xia Jia\u2019s career. Trained to be a physicist as an undergraduate, she leapt into film studies and comparative literature for graduate school (her Ph.D. dissertation is titled \u201cFear and Hope in the Age of Globalization: Contemporary Chinese Science Fiction and Its Cultural Politics (1991\u20132012)\u201d). Her works are imbued with the tension between shifting tradition and revolutionary modernity, core and periphery, the written word and the moving image, rational analysis and intuitive recognition.\n A multiple winner of the Yinhe (Galaxy) and Xingyun (Nebula) Awards for Chinese science fiction, Xia Jia is beloved by many fans and praised by fellow writers, but as a woman writer in a male-dominated field whose work defies easy categorization under schemes such as \u201cscience fiction / fantasy\u201d or \u201chard / soft SF,\u201d her stories have also continued to generate controversy.\n (Although Xia Jia and I usually communicate in a mixture of Chinese and English, at her request, this interview was conducted in English.)\n Welcome, Xia Jia. In the past, you\u2019ve described your fiction as \u201cporridge SF\u201d (\u7a00\u996d\u79d1\u5e7b). Can you explain what that means?\n Thanks, Ken. Glad to talk with you. I never imagined that one day I would have to tell this story to the English world.\n I didn\u2019t invent the term \u201cporridge SF.\u201d Many years ago, after I showed my best friend Yang Qing a short story I wrote in high school composition class, she said, \u201cIf we consider Ted Chiang\u2019s \u2018Tower of Babylon\u2019 as a masterpiece of soft SF, then I must congratulate you on having created this beautiful piece of \u2018porridge SF\u2019!\u201d\n Chinese people describe steamed rice as \u201chard rice\u201d or \u201csoft rice\u201d based on the water content, and porridge is obviously softer even than \u201csoft rice.\u201d Porridge SF thus describes a story mixed with so many non-science elements (e.g. myth, legend or folklore) that it can hardly be classified as \u201cscience fiction\u201d anymore, like \u201cTower of Babylon.\u201d\n Since both Yang and I were big Ted Chiang fans, the phrase was intended as a compliment.\n After the controversy around whether \u201cThe Demon-Enslaving Flask\u201d was really \u201cscience fiction,\u201d in 2005 I published my second story \u201cCarmen,\u201d a space opera mixed with a gothic legend of the mysterious dancing girl Carmen. In a postscript, I declared that \u201cno matter how many may refuse to acknowledge the \u2018SFnal cloak\u2019 around this story, I will continue to devote myself to this seemingly promising career in \u2018porridge SF.\u2019\u201d \u201cPorridge SF\u201d thus became the phrase to describe my style, which is usually regarded as the opposite of hard SF or so-called \u201ccore SF,\u201d as exemplified by Liu Cixin\u2019s works.\n \u201cA Hundred Ghosts Parade Tonight\u201d was the first story by you to appear in English (Clarkesworld, February 2012; originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, August 2010). Lois Tilton described it as \u201cliterary science fiction . . . where exceptional prose mingles the tropes of SF and fantasy and inform us that such distinctions are not so important.\u201d It seems that the debate over genre boundaries is universal (though the debate also seems to me useless). What are some other ways that critics have described your work?\n Besides \u201cporridge SF,\u201d my work is frequently described as typical \u201cgirlish soft SF,\u201d which brings me biting comments and attacks from those who believe women are never qualified enough to write \u201chard SF\u201d but can only make up watered-down love stories (I have noticed that many of those critics are also women).\n I really appreciate Tilton\u2019s remark, and I agree with you that the perennial debate over the distinction of hard SF from soft SF is most of the time pointless, which is why I have resisted further elaboration of the definition of \u201cporridge SF.\u201d I mean, it is not a slogan or manifesto, but only an attempt to give a name to something nameless wandering in the twilight zone. Likewise, \u201cfemale SF\u201d is another phrase I feel is tough to define. It is not my purpose to prove \u201cfemale SF\u201d can be as hard as \u201cmale SF/core SF,\u201d or that \u201cthe soft\u201d deserves higher evaluation than \u201cthe hard.\u201d All I have been trying to do is to follow my instinct to explore the frontier between \u201cthe core\u201d and \u201cthe fringe,\u201d the known and the unknown. It is perhaps the most exciting experience that science fiction can bring us.\n Speaking of \u201chard SF,\u201d you actually studied at the School of Physics, Peking University, as an undergraduate (and you\u2019ve helped me to get the science in my stories right). How (if at all) has your training and background in science affected your approach to literary analysis and fiction writing?\n The science training has been useful both for my studies and my writing. If I have any question about a science topic, I can search for published papers instead of relying on media reports by journalists. It\u2019s not boring; instead, the work will drive you to know this world better and love it more.\n To give you a specific example, recently I gave a lecture on time travel where, using the \u201cbutterfly effect,\u201d I explained that we cannot predict the weather or one\u2019s trajectory in life accurately. Every second in our past matters equally.\n It has taken all the moments of my life for me to become who I am today. Life is such a beautiful gift that no matter how carefully you measure it out it will seem like a waste. So don\u2019t panic, and there\u2019s time enough for love.\n Your story, \u201cTongtong\u2019s Summer\u201d (Upgraded, edited by Neil Clarke, 2014; Chinese publication in ZUI Fiction, March 2014), offered a positive future of cyborgs and robots in contrast to many of the other stories in the anthology. Is this optimism something new in your recent work? Where does it come from?\n That\u2019s an interesting observation. I still remember when I was a little girl, most of the western science fiction stories I read involved dystopias where lives are dark and depressing. People struggle but fail, and come to a totally hopeless, nihilistic end. I used to be fascinated by those visions of the future.\n However, I couldn\u2019t help wondering whether there truly is no escape or if we are just unable to imagine it because of some mental constraints. Probably because I was taught from a young age that history is a process of endless struggle, and humanity, as a historical subject, should bring its creative spirit into play.\n About \u201cTongtong\u2019s Summer\u201d in particular: I have aging grandparents who require care and have tried to do some of the nursing work myself. The work was exhausting, but I also found the personal connection in nursing to be a meaningful and irreplaceable element. This inspired me to come up with the remote-controlled elder care aide.\n The story is also dedicated to my departed grandfather. A revolutionary hero, he was an energetic man until a brain tumor struck him down. I imagined an alternative future, where Grandpa raged against the bonds placed on him by his disease and changed his own predicament\u2014and the world\u2014from his wheelchair. It is only an imagined solace, of course, but one that has the possibility to be realized someday.\n This possibility depends on us, on the courage and love inside every ordinary, mortal individual.\n A lot of your work draws on Chinese traditions and customs, showing how they retain their essence in the face of technological and social change. But you\u2019ve also told me that you\u2019re not deeply attached to traditional Chinese culture. Can you reconcile these two sentiments for me?\n Honestly, to answer this question you must reconsider \u201cwhat is traditional Chinese culture\u201d first. Since China has been experiencing great transformations in the process of modernization\u2014\u201call that is solid melts into air\u201d\u2014one can hardly say such cultural attachment is a natural feeling or a historical construction. I appreciate classical Chinese literature as well as you or any other contemporary reader, but I cannot imagine that on some future day we would dig out certain \u201ctraditional wisdom\u201d from ancient books to defend against high-tech space invaders. [KL: hey, that gives me an idea for a story . . .]\n Traditions are always changing over time. It is we, the present generation living on the frontier between tradition and modernity, present and future, who struggle for our self-affirmation, not some \u201ctradition\u201d that retains its own self-evident essence.\n Readers are sometimes curious about how I\u2019ve changed your stories in the process of translation. Can you talk a bit about that?\n I remember in the draft translation of \u201cSpring Festival: Happiness, Anger, Love, Sorrow, Joy\u201d (Clarkesworld, September 2014; originally published in Chinese in Science Fiction World, June 2013), you provided a few delicate adjustments, which made me smile. For example, in \u201cNew Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d you inserted a few words that the Spring Festival Gala used to be \u201csinging, dancing, a few stupid jokes and it\u2019s over\u201d to explain the program for American readers. And my reaction was \u201cOh yeah, you know about that!\u201d Similarly in \u201cMatchmaking,\u201d when the manager advised Xiao Li to ask for her mother\u2019s help on those virtual dates, you added an interpretation that \u201cafter all, marriage is about two families coming together.\u201d That was very helpful, otherwise American readers might find the whole \u201cmommy counselor\u201d thing totally incomprehensible.\n The most obvious change is your recommendation to excise the \u201cValentine\u201d segment to shorten the story in order to make it easier to sell. Also, you wanted a new title instead of translating it literally as \u201cOld Memories of Spring Festival in 2044.\u201d We argued about this over email and finally reached a consensus: the mini-stories focused on complicated emotions in a changing world, not precise predictions of the future. I really enjoy such discussions. It feels like, well, in your story \u201cThe Shape of Thought,\u201d the children of humans and aliens weaving their fingers together and trying to understand this world in a new, strange way.\n Parapax was initially inspired by Alan Brennert\u2019s short story \u201cEchoes,\u201d which depicts a woman\u2019s quantum lives proliferating from her various decisions and possibilities. I shared this idea with my friend Wang Yao, who suggested we try to tell a similar story visually. I wrote the script.\n In the film, a young woman majoring in physics wakes up one day to find herself the heroine of a science fiction story. Meanwhile, an author is composing this story in another world where she suddenly meets a mysterious man in black who is a character from her story. In yet a third world, a scriptwriter is talking about science fiction and film with the director.\n I had to play all three characters myself because Xia Jia A, B and C are different images of me. Centered on \u201cparallel worlds,\u201d \u201cmultiple reality\u201d and \u201ccrossover,\u201d the film is also \u201cmeta-SF\u201d or \u201cmeta-cinema.\u201d The title \u201cParapax\u201d combines \u201cparallel\u201d and \u201cK-pax\u201d (Gene Brewer\u2019s SF novel and Iain Softley\u2019s film). We loved this name because its pronunciation sounded cool.\n You\u2019re involved in so many pursuits: artistic, academic, and literary. How do you balance it all?\n I don\u2019t know. Most of time I\u2019m just fascinated by something and let myself be pulled in like an addict.\n For example, when Ray Bradbury passed away in June 2014, I felt I had to do something as a tribute to his memory. So I spent two weeks translating seven short stories from The Illustrated Man before I had to stop to get ready for Chicon 7. When I went to the U.S. Embassy to apply for my visa\u2014a rather stressful process in which applicants are often denied\u2014the visa officer asked me: \u201cSo you are going to take part in a SF Convention? Who\u2019s your favorite SF writer? Tell me your favorite works.\u201d I answered: \u201cRay Bradbury! Blahblahblah . . . \u201d Then he passed me a yellow note: \u201cCool! Have a nice day!\u201d\n I rushed out. Standing in the street and looking up into the sky, I said: \u201cThanks, Ray!\u201d\n So I guess maybe there is no balance in my life, just \u201clet it go!\u201d and beautiful adventures that follow.\n What\u2019s next?\n Preparing for a great SF course in Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University where I\u2019m teaching. Creating a great SF novel, and a SF film if I\u2019m lucky. Staying healthy and waiting for my opportunity to travel to space (I\u2019m not kidding).\n Ken Liu is an American author of speculative fiction.

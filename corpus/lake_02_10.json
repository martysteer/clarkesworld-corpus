She was a charter\u2014a rare thing, in a starship, which signified pockets deeper than planetary budgets\u2014and the passengers reportedly wanted to lift out, but her pilot wasn\u2019t lighting up without the alignment problem being solved. Spanich could get behind this. Faced with the choice of a well-monied tongue lashing or being smeared in rainbow quarks across a few dozen lightyears, he\u2019d take the dressing down every time.\nBesides, he was the only drive tech on Estacada Orbital certified to work the finicky and bizarre paired drives that post-Mistake starships relied upon. Supraluminal travel was so sporadic that if the system got half a dozen outside visitors a year, it was considered busy. And most of them flew with their own maintenance crews as a matter of course. Mare Imbrium {13 pairs} was practically a yacht, the smallest starship he\u2019d ever seen or heard of.\nThe shipmind kept whispering specs and test results to him in a voice that made the hairs on his arms prickle and stiffen. Fair enough. A man shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable with the machines that kept him alive. Mistrust was healthy.\nThank the saints he wasn\u2019t signed onto this bucket for this run. Their quantum bloc cross-processors weren\u2019t piping temporal data flow correctly. No one had liked his suggestion to pull the whole rig and reconfigure on a bench back at the station. A week\u2019s work, at a minimum. But Spanich wouldn\u2019t trust his life to the jigger he\u2019d been ordered to attempt in the name of expediency.\nHe sighed and focused on the circuit joins. Nose-to-panel, flat on his back, falling asleep with the smartprobe in his hand, Spanich knew he was still better off working here than back in the engineering pool rotation.\n\u201cDomitian,\u201d said the shipmind. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for you to stand down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Spanich snapped.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just probed the same shunt five times.\u201d\nHe sighed, unclipped his instruments, and wriggled back into the engineering bay. That was only moderately less claustrophobic than the service accessway he\u2019d just spent twenty hours in, minus breaks for pee and chow. \u201cHome,\u201d Spanich said to no one in particular, then began packing up.\nRibo thumped from the big speakers embedded in the floor of the Bar Gin. When the bass riffs hit, peanut shells danced across the table like cootch girls on payday. Most places used ambient nano to whisper music, but Bar Gin was so old school they probably hadn\u2019t even invented reading, writing or differential equations back when the place had been founded.\nSpanich huddled in a booth and wondered why he hadn\u2019t gone home to sleep. \u2018Home\u2019 being a two-point-two meter-long tube, a meter in diameter. He paid extra for rack space for his hardsuit, and extra extra to make sure parts didn\u2019t vanish from it during off shifts. Still, sleep would have made more sense for him than crouching here over some of Bitter Jane\u2019s homebrew algae beer listening to music which had been crap when he was a kid, and not improved since.\nThen Austen wandered into the joint, and Spanich\u2019s world grew a little brighter. That boy just moved right. Cute enough kid, and buff in a way that kept the eye resting easy, and he smelled like heaven on a Friday night, but the way Austen walked sometimes kept Spanich up late, sweating.\nHe raised his hand, waved to Austen, but the kid\u2019s gaze slid right over Spanich like he wasn\u2019t there. Was it too dark back here in the booth? Maybe too much toke smoke in the air.\nWho the hell was he kidding?\nAusten No Last Name didn\u2019t give a shit about Domitian Spanich. Sometimes the kid gave a shit about Domitian Spanich\u2019s pay chitty, when the keycard was fat with local thalers, or more rarely, Imperial schillings. Except payday was seventeen shifts away right now, and Austen could scent \u2018broke\u2019 the way a sniffer could find a carbon dioxide breach in a scrubber tank.\nSpanich sank deeper into his algae beer and wondered why the hell he couldn\u2019t ever fall in love with anyone available. There was no lack of available talent. Half the guys torquing vacuum here on Estacada Orbital swung his way. For his own part, Spanich knew he was decent enough looking, and a good lover\u2014it didn\u2019t take raging egotism to sort out those kinds of truths, not once you\u2019d left teen hormones behind. But somehow he always tumbled for the pretty boys, the working kids, who\u2019d roll over and whisper sweet nothings while they let him play their bodies like harps, but always ran off with each other for the real laughs or the quiet times.\n\u201cDommie,\u201d said a voice for the second time.\nStartled, he looked up from his beer, slopping some of it onto the tabletop. A warning blinked with pixel-rotted irritation from beneath the greenish puddles, but he ignored that.\nAusten!\nSpanich tried desperately to stay cool. \u201cHey.\u201d\nHis sometime-lover sat down. \u201cMind if I join you?\u201d\nThat crooked smile always melted Spanich. \u201cUh, yeah. Let, let me get you something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m locked and stocked,\u201d Austen said. Those violet eyes seemed to glitter in the bar\u2019s lousy lighting. \u201cBitter Jane\u2019s sending something over. Said she\u2019d put it on your tab.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a\u2014\u201d Spanich managed to shut himself up before he looked any stupider. \u201cOh, right. Good. Happy to buy you one.\u201d He tried to fight the goofy grin he could feel taking over his face. \u201cOr more,\u201d he blurted. Lots more.\nThank the pressure demons this place was so dark. Austen couldn\u2019t see him blush, at least.\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind if I don\u2019t.\u201d The kid\u2019s crooked smile flashed into an answering grin that looked so free, so easy, that Spanich wondered why he even bothered to try.\nHe kept himself cautious. Don\u2019t hope, don\u2019t hope, don\u2019t hope. \u201cSo, uh, what\u2019s up?\u201d\nA drink arrived on a rollerbot, a cybernetic waiter converted from a level one security drone. For all Spanich had ever been able to tell, it might still be a kill platform. You couldn\u2019t know, not with Bitter Jane in play.\nAusten picked up the long, graceful ceramometallic stem, frost sparkling diamond bright as mist curled off its sides.\nGreat, thought Spanich. One of Jane\u2019s thousand-thaler cryoliquid specials. Someone here was pushing their luck. Spanich had a sick fear that he was the chump. There was his next pay chitty gone, and a decent portion of his liquid savings. So to speak.\n\u201cWell . . . \u201d The kid took a long, slow sip, batting his eyelashes.\nFocus, focus.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been working on the Mare Imbrium, right?\u201d\nSpanich winced. Austen even pronounced the old, old term wrong, as if he were speaking Classical English instead of Preclassical Spanish or Mayan or whatever language of lost Earth those words came from.\n\u201cMare Imbrium, thirteen pairs.\u201d Spanich corrected the kid\u2019s pronunciation and usage both. \u201cAnd the shipminds are mighty picky about getting their numbers right.\u201d\n\u201cShipminds,\u201d Austen said. \u201cYeah. Whatever.\u201d\nIn that moment, Spanich suddenly wondered what it was he\u2019d found so alluring about Austen. Sure, the kid was smoking hot, like fire in an oxygen plant, but had he never noticed how dumb Austen was. Maybe some dirtball farmer wouldn\u2019t know the difference, but how could anyone survive in an orbital habitat and be so ignorant of the basic etiquette of ships and shipminds? The kind of ignorant that got people spaced out an airlock, or their breathing license erased from the station records.\n\u201cLook . . . \u201d Spanich felt obscurely deflated and betrayed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Mare Imbrium thirteen. There\u2019s a charter riding her this trip, and I hear the woman is deep-fried trouble on a fuckstick, if you catch my datastream. Let\u2019s have a drink and, I don\u2019t know, go dancing. Forget about starships, kid. They never mattered to you before, did they?\u201d\nAusten shrugged and smiled. The wattage seemed to have gone out of his expression, but maybe that was just Spanich. \u201cI need something, Dommie. Something only you can help me with.\u201d\n\u201cOnly me, huh?\u201d The words just slipped out of his triple-shift exhausted mouth. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you\u2019re sucking down a thousand-thaler drink on my tab? To get in good?\u201d\nThe ceramometallic stem hit the table with a click that would have cracked ordinary plastic. \u201cDommie, please . . . \u201d\nSpanich stood up. \u201cI\u2019m tired, I need to sleep, I\u2019m going home.\u201d\nAusten shot out of his chair, grabbing for Spanich\u2019s rough, greasy hand with his own slim, manicured fingers. \u201cAt least let me come with you.\u201d\nClose, with that smell, though he knew them both for idiots, Spanich couldn\u2019t say no to that. Even if he\u2019d been awake enough to stop this disaster before it got any worse, with Austen standing so close his hormones were kicking ass and taking names.\nHome they went, together.\nThe tube\u2019s comm panel beeped him out of dreams into the reality of an itching belly\u2014cum always dried that way on his skin\u2014and a gently snoring Austen. Spanich nudged a crusty towel aside and punched the sleepshift override.\nThat didn\u2019t stop the beeping.\nHe focused on the little display. Priority message, channel two. His blood chilled. Station ops.\n\u201cWhat the . . . ?\u201d He stabbed again, brought up voice-no-video mode. \u201cSpanich.\u201d\nAusten groaned, tucked in tighter to his side. Spanich patted the kid, trying to soothe him enough not to make noise on this call.\nThe speaker crackled, shitty cheap tech like everything his type ever got, other than the tools of their trade. \u201cEngineering Supervisor Spanich?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. \u2018s what I said.\u201d He blinked some sand from his eyes, and ignored hot memories of the most recent midshift here inside the comfortably tight confines of his sleeping tube.\n\u201cThis is Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome, Adjutant-Intendant of Estacada Orbital operations.\u201d\nWhoa. Only flash brass used names that long. And most of the hypercrust didn\u2019t bother to work for a living. \u201cAlright. I\u2019m impressed now.\u201d Damn, he needed to be smarter.\nAusten stirred. \u201cWhu . . . ?\u201d Spanich jammed his fingers in the kid\u2019s mouth. Reflexively, Austen began to suckle.\n\u201cYour presence is requested and required at berth eleven, docking boom gamma.\u201d\nShit on an airfilter! That would be the current hookup of ICV Mare Imbrium {13 pairs}. \u201cI\u2019m not due back til thirteen hundred hours.\u201d\n\u201cRequested and required, Engineering Supervisor Spanich. Would an escort facilitate your prompt presence?\u201d\nShit! What was this about? \u201cAh, no. I\u2019ll be there fast.\u201d\n\u201cAdjutant-Intendant out.\u201d\nHis comm panel died with a definitive pop that suggested further conversation would not only be pointless, but impossible. Spanich looked down at Austin, who was busy slurping the last of their midnight passion off his fingertips.\nHe was the chump, alright. Flash brass played for fatal stakes. Not their lives, of course, but the lives of people like him. And people like Austen.\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you want last night?\u201d Spanich grabbed Austen\u2019s hair, forced the kid\u2019s head back until they were staring eye to eye. \u201cWhat the fuck did you do?\u201d\nAusten didn\u2019t have a hell of a lot to say at first. Spanich poured some bulb-coffee into him anyway, on principle, while slamming a couple for himself. He didn\u2019t let go of the kid, either, dragging him into the shitter, then the scrubstall.\nWhen the water hit them at 0.5 celsius, Austen sputtered into some fairly creative profanity. \u201cYou gruyere-scented douchenozzle, I\u2019m going to kick your ass from the throat down, then yank your nuts\u2014\u201d\nSpanich slapped him. \u201cHush up, dearie,\u201d he growled, dragging Austen\u2019s face so close they might have been kissing again. Somehow, being naked and wet with the kid wasn\u2019t doing much for him this morning. \u201cYou know how many times in my life flash brass has rung my bell?\u201d\nAusten found his voice. \u201cTh-they put their jocks on one strap at a time like everybody else.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. And maybe they have platinum-plated jeweled nut sacks snapped on every morning by hermaphroditic dwarves. How the fuck would I know? Because never in my entire pressure-bleeding life have I had to take a call like that one.\u201d He shook the kid hard, banging that pretty head against the scrubstall\u2019s algaplastic lining. \u201cAnd I\u2019d bet my last gene scan you have something to do with it. You and your Mayor Eye-breye-um.\u201d\n\u201cMare Imbrium.\u201d This time he pronounced the name right.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Mare Imbrium, thirteen pairs, to you, my friend. Shipminds are damned proud, and have very long arms indeed when they\u2019re riled up.\u201d Even talking about it here in the scrubstall made him nervous.\nSpanich dragged the shivering, naked Austen back to his tube, then forced the kid to dress by the simple expedient of bending his fingers back til he agreed. This one would run like a ball bearing if given the chance, and he figured on bringing Austen in as a kind of human shield for whatever it was the Adjutant-Intendant of Estacada Orbital had in mind for him.\nAll too soon for Spanich\u2019s taste, they were off among the sweat-reeking passageways of the station\u2019s guest-worker quarters. A person could get almost anywhere in this place without leaving oil footprints on the tourist walkways. Mostly he liked it that way, though if they\u2019d dial the heat up even halfway to tourist standards, he\u2019d have been a hell of a lot happier.\nAusten had given up even muttering, and let himself be dragged along like a second toolbag. Whatever fate was coming, Spanich was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t a surprise to the kid.\nJust outside the lock array for docking boom gamma, Austen made his break. The kid stomped down hard on Spanich\u2019s instep, or would have if Spanich hadn\u2019t been wearing carbon-jacketed boots rated up to sixty gravities of pressure.\nHis second mistake was waiting until Orbital Security\u2019s troopers had them in sight. Which was probably what panicked the kid, Spanich realized, as he knocked Austen down and went to one knee of top of the kid\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck around in front of the troopies,\u201d he hissed.\nThe troopies were watching the scene with mild disinterest. Mild disinterest suited Spanich just fine. No hands on weapons, everybody stayed peaceful. He dragged an out-of-breath Austen back to both their feet, then manhandled the kid right up to the troopers.\nNow their interest was neither mild nor dis. \u201cYou guys feeling brave?\u201d asked the right-hand cop. Spanich vaguely recognized him from the Bar Gin, dude with space-black skin and eyes that shade of violent green that said that one of his ancestors had come from Falkesen sometime post-Mistake. Nobody from a human norm gene line had irises that color.\nThe left hand cop, a fellow with nubbly skin and tight epicanthic folds, drew his stungun for emphasis. Bad cop, then.\n\u201cGot a call-in,\u201d Spanich said to the good cop, keeping his chin down, his lips closed and his tone quiet. \u201cAdjutant-Intendant wants us up on Mare Imbrium, thirteen pairs.\u201d\nAusten squirmed at that, but Spanich knuckled his collar tighter. The kid seemed to get the message.\n\u201cYou that Spinach guy?\u201d green-eyes asked.\n\u201cSpan-ick. It\u2019s Span-ick.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d The weapon was reholstered with the same bored air. Green-eyes gave Austen a long look, making no move to cycle the lock. \u201cWho\u2019s the cyclone ranger there?\u201d\n\u201cMy lovely and talented assistant,\u201d Spanich informed his feet.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t say nothing about no assistant.\u201d\nHe looked up, caught the fellow\u2019s green eyes. \u201cDid anyone say I couldn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cHey . . . \u201d The cop spread his arms wide, letting go the responsibility. \u201cYou want to wave your dick around in front of flash brass, be my guest.\u201d He glanced at his partner. \u201cThey tooled?\u201d\nBad cop had the faraway gaze of someone reading a retinal implant. Finally he spoke, his voice like gravel in an airshaft. \u201cNothing out of profile.\u201d\n\u201cYour lucky day,\u201d said green eyes. \u201cNo cavity search. Hell, not even a pat down.\u201d He leaned close. \u201cWe got orders to run light and easy for now.\u201d\nSpanich nodded vigorously. \u201cLight and easy it is, sir.\u201d Well, at least there hadn\u2019t been a murder aboard the starship. Not of anyone important, at any rate. They\u2019d be a lot more sealed up out here if so. He waited while bad cop punched in an access code\u2014not one Spanich recognized\u2014then waved them into the transition tube.\nWaiting for the outer lock to cycle, he leaned very close to Austen. \u201cWhat are you so afraid of?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be sorry you asked,\u201d the kid replied in a low whisper. His words sounded like a threat, but nothing in Austen\u2019s voice, stance or stink of fear-sweat backed that up.\nNot murder then, but something worse?\nThey found another troopie at berth eleven. This one didn\u2019t bother to shake out their suits\u2014he just cycled open the lock and let Spanich and Austen go in, not saying a word. Spanich did note that the tote board alongside the berth\u2019s lock had been blacked out. Which was both unsafe, and he was pretty sure, illegal. Not open-flame illegal, but still a safety violation waiting for a monitor to write a fine-and-dine.\nThe berth lock opened to the familiar accordion-walled transfer tube. Inside, Spanich\u2019s breath damned near crystallized as he grabbed the lead lines. Air this stupid-cold meant someone had shut off the enviros, probably since he\u2019d left Mare Imbrium thirteen\u2019s deck a shift and a half ago. When there were no troopies guarding access, for one thing.\nAnd they hadn\u2019t had the stuff back up long.\n\u201cDommie.\u201d Austen\u2019s voice was pleading as they approached Mare Imbrium thirteen\u2019s hull lock.\nNo, Spanich realized, not pleading. Terrified. \u201cIs this where you give it up?\u201d He stopped them, floating in the tube\u2019s microgravity. They had maybe a minute, tops, before whoever was expecting them onboard got unpleasant.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to d-do this.\u201d The kid\u2019s teeth were chattering.\n\u201cA little late now. You could have spoke up last night, instead of playing rolypoly with me for half a shift. Or anytime before now, even.\u201d\n\u201cYou h-have no idea.\u201d\nClose, so close that the kid\u2019s smell began lighting up his backbrain once more, Spanich growled, \u201cSo give me a fucking idea, punk.\u201d\n\u201cThat w-woman on board. She\u2019s not just some charter tourist.\u201d\n\u201cWho is she, then?\u201d\n\u201cMy mom.\u201d The abject terror in Austen\u2019s voice was frightening.\nThe little bastard knew this ship all along then. He\u2019d been faking, before. Faking everything, then? Spanich didn\u2019t see much point in asking who the kid\u2019s mother was. \u201cFamily reunion time.\u201d\nThey kicked off together, heading the last few meters to the hull lock. Spanich was surprised how graceful Austen had suddenly become, for someone who had seemed to know so little about starships and life in space.\nHe was even more surprised when the lock cycled at the touch of Austen\u2019s fingertip on the bioscanner. Though, really, Spanich was starting to realize, he shouldn\u2019t have been.\nAdjutant-Intendant Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome waited in the passageway beyond. There was no mistaking a flash brass\u2014no one else dressed like them, or looked like them, or stood as if they owned the worlds of the Imperium Humana.\nWhich they as good as did, of course.\nThe Adjutant-Intendant stood about two meters, forty cents, but didn\u2019t weigh above sixty kilos. It was all whipcord muscle, bred in through the better part of a thousand years of careful genetic planning, since the Mistake. Every schoolchild knew this, because every schoolchild was taught why the Familia Majora\u2014flash brass\u2014ruled over them all.\nHis skin was velvety black, similar to the guard outside. These were people who treated chromosomal radiation damage as a preventable disease on the par with influenza or head lice, after all. The Adjutant-Intendant\u2019s eyes had the liquid silver look of someone whose optical nano bloom had been induced in utero, and carefully cultivated ever since.\nIf he\u2019d had a few billion Imperial schillings, and some key Writs of Exemption, Spanich could have bought most of that package for himself. Adjutant-Intendant Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome wore it all like someone born to two dozen generations of that inheritance.\n\u201cEngineering Supervisor Spanich.\u201d His voice had the tone of a man finding a slug under a salad leaf.\n\u201cReporting, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWere you ordered to bring an accompanist.\u201d\n\u201cMy assistant, Jim,\u201d Spanich said, immediately regretting the stupid lie.\n\u201cJim . . . ?\u201d The Adjutant-Intendant looked Austen over briefly. \u201cYour wit is at least half misplaced, Engineering Supervisor.\u201d\nSpanich wondered if that had been the flash brass equivalent of a joke. \u201cYour comm was urgent, sir. I figured this might take an extra pair of hands.\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d With a visible letting go\u2014meant to be visible, Spanich was certain\u2014the Adjutant-Intendant continued. \u201cWe are aboard because the Mare Imbrium shipmind has declared an emergency.\u201d\n\u201cThirteen pairs, you cocksucker,\u201d muttered Austen. Spanich could have backjacked the little bastard for that\u2014referring to shipminds that was a prerogative of the highest aristos among the flash brass, a rank thing\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to make this agonizing scene that much worse.\nThe look in the flash brass\u2019 eyes could have frozen helium. \u201cIndeed. Mare Imbrium, thirteen pairs. I see why Engineering Supervisor Spanich values your services, Jim. As I was saying, the shipmind has declared an emergency, which it determined only you could resolve.\u201d\n\u201cI was coming back in half a shift, anyway,\u201d Spanich pointed out. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time in this engineering bay, these past few shift-cycles.\u201d\nThe shipmind\u2019s voice echoed through the corridor, a whisper like thunder\u2014pervasive and overwhelming, but not loud. \u201cThis seems an opportune time to redirect.\u201d\nThe hair on Spanich\u2019s arms prickled. Far more astonishing, even Adjutant-Intendant Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome looked surprised. Austen just groaned.\n\u201cPlease escort our new visitors to the wardroom, Markie,\u201d the ambient voice continued.\nSpanich nearly choked. No one called flash brass by a nickname, not like that. Not even other flash brass. From the look of him, much like a man swallowing a live eel, the Intendant-General was no less surprised.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, his voice in the perfect equilibrium that his facial expression had failed to retain.\nAusten groaned again. Spanich was beginning to mightily regret bringing the kid, and was already thinking hard about ways to get out of this alive and free.\nThe wardroom hatch slid open. Where the passageway had been utilitarian\u2014hookfabric carpet, grab bars, emergency stations every five meters; all the usual details of space travel\u2014the wardroom was astonishing in its simple, almost terrible luxury.\nA pond. A pond, on a starship. These people weren\u2019t just wealthy, they were insane. The little pool of black water was walled around with rock, filled by a bamboo pipe serving as a fountain. The floor was pebbled like raked gravel, though Spanich\u2019s engineering eye noted that was a texture, not half a ton of loose stone ready to break free in the event of a grav failure. The walls were of some woven reed matting, while the ceiling was draped with a rough, undyed fabric.\nAll highly illegal, according to any safety standards he\u2019d ever been lectured about. Illegal, unsafe . . .\nNext to the pond was a low black lacquer table aggressively simple in its lines. A woman knelt behind it, her robes a coarse, raw fabric that almost matched the ceiling. She had an air of extreme age about her\u2014not like the Befores, those crazed, dangerous immortals everyone whispered about, that Spanich had even met one once\u2014but more like an ordinary person who\u2019d lived an extraordinarily long time with very good medical care.\nAnd eyes like hull-cutting lasers. Eyes that happened to be the same pale violet as Austen\u2019s.\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said.\nSpanich knew where the Mare Imbrium thirteen shipmind had modeled its voice from. In those velvet tones, he could hear the armies march at a word, feel the bar emptying for a fight to the last man standing. He had to force himself not to kneel.\nAusten did go down on one knee. So did Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome. The Adjutant-Intendant gave Spanich a glance which should have fried skin off his bones.\nWhat the hells was he missing here?\n\u201cHe can be forgiven because he does not know,\u201d the woman said.\nThe voice again. And her scent, in this room as subtle as atomized lubricant moving through an air duct. She and Austen were of a\u2014\nHe broke off the thought, staring at the kid in horror.\n\u201cMother,\u201d Austen finally said in a low voice so unlike his usual attitude that if the words had not come out of his mouth, Spanich wouldn\u2019t have known.\n\u201cTranh Shankakini Clovis McVail Austen deLacey sub-Rachman sub-Nagona,\u201d she replied.\nSomewhere in that welter of flash brass name, Spanich picked out the kid. He\u2019d been fucking a runaway, and from the length of the name, one of the highest-placed runaways possible. How had the kid managed to seem so normal, instead of gene-modded to hell and gone like the Adjutant-Intendant?\nAusten bowed so low his head almost touched the floor.\nClovis, thought Spanich. She\u2019d said Clovis. He nearly shit himself. These people were Imperial family! There should have been a battalion outside the lock, not two bored station troopers.\nNo wonder the Adjutant-Intendant had been glaring him to death. Clumsy, shivering, clammy with sweat, Spanich dropped to one knee as well.\n\u201cMare Imbrium tells me that you are working to set her drive to rights, Domitian Spanich.\u201d\n\u201cMa\u2019am. I\u2019m . . . \u201d He didn\u2019t know what to say. He wasn\u2019t qualified to work on a starship carrying members of the Imperial family.\nThe shipmind spoke. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with my drives, Engineering Supervisor Spanich. But I thank you for your work.\u201d\n\u201cAll a ruse, I am afraid.\u201d Austen\u2019s mother smiled at him. He was ready to lay himself at her feet if she\u2019d just do it again. \u201cNecessary to keep us in port without question while certain rumors were . . . traced.\u201d\nSpanich glanced over at Austen. The kid was pressed to the floor, his voice a whisper when he asked, \u201cWhy tell me now?\u201d\n\u201cSo you would understand what must happen to you next,\u201d she replied, her voice now steel-hard. Austen took a sharp breath, then fell completely silent. The Adjutant-Intendant moved slightly, still on his right knee but shifting his weight in preparation for action.\nIn that moment, Spanich\u2019s future became very narrow and very short. He stood, shaking off the spell of that voice, and reached slowly for his toolbag. Austen\u2019s mother nodded slightly at the Adjutant-Intendant, who then spoke, his voice harsh. \u201cWhat are you doing, Engineering Supervisor Spanich?\u201d\nThe words slipped out of him like bullets dropping from an open clip. \u201cPreparing to die like a man.\u201d Truly, he had no idea.\n\u201cMother,\u201d Austen said, his voice so low it was almost a squeak.\nShe gave Olivez Marquessa Inanometriano Parkinson sub-Ngome another significant look. Spanich took his cue and swung the toolbag hard, letting the strap pay out so fifteen kilos of metal and ballistic cloth took the bastard right in the temple. Two dozen generations of exquisite germline engineering dropped to the floor like a stunned drunk.\n\u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to kill me yourself,\u201d Spanich said, breathing hard. Austen was splayed flat on deck, hiccuping or laughing or crying or something. \u201cOr is it Princess?\u201d\n\u201cIs this how a man dies?\u201d she asked, deceptively conversational.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Spanich tried to catch up to his adrenaline, slow himself down. \u201cOn his feet, fighting for his life.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d moaned Austen.\n\u201cDo you care for this man?\u201d his mother asked, curiosity filling her voice. Spanich let the bag swing on its strap, but she ignored the makeshift weapon utterly.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Austen whimpered, practically embracing the floor. Then, \u201cYes. No.\u201d\nHer gaze met Spanich\u2019s again, and he wondered how he\u2019d ever confused this woman for human.\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry, Engineering Supervisor Spanich, but my son does not seem to be speaking up for you.\u201d\nHe expected to be shot in the back, but the hatch continued to fail to open, and hordes of guards bristling with armament did not leap into the room. \u201cI can speak for myself, ma\u2019am. I\u2019m as much a citizen as you or he.\u201d\n\u201cThen go.\u201d Her voice was almost a whisper now.\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d Spanich blurted.\n\u201cWho would believe your story?\u201d A laugh was hidden in her words somewhere.\nOn impulse, he reached down and grabbed at Austen\u2019s shoulder without taking his eye off the old woman. \u201cYou coming, kid?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\nShe interrupted. \u201cMy son is not free to go.\u201d\nFeckless impulse rose inside of Spanich on a red wave of anger. \u201cHe\u2019s a citizen, too.\u201d\nThe Adjutant-Intendant groaned, then stirred.\nAusten\u2019s mother glanced at the man, then turned her attention back. \u201cWalk away, Engineering Supervisor Spanich, with your unbelievable story. You\u2019ve won that much in standing up to authority. Take your life and go.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d The anger poured out of him in a flood of words. \u201cWhen Markie wakes up and gets onto comm, I\u2019m a dead man. Station troopers will pinch me, and I\u2019ll never be seen again. I\u2019ve already committed two, maybe three capital crimes here! Talking directly to you is probably another one.\u201d\n\u201cHow you keep your prize is not my trouble.\u201d Her face narrowed, the first real expression he\u2019d seen on her. \u201cNow depart.\u201d\nSpanich tugged at Austen\u2019s shoulder, dragged the kid to his feet. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nAusten stood shaking. His mother slipped a small flechette gun from beneath her robes.\nAh, thought Spanich, and wondered why he wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he hissed in Austen\u2019s ear. \u201cNobody deserves to be pushed around like this.\u201d\nThe flechette gun was unwavering. \u201cTranh Shankakini Clovis McVail Austen deLacey sub-Rachman sub-Nagona, you are coming home with me.\u201d\n\u201cMother . . . \u201d The kid seemed so lost.\n\u201cYou already said that.\u201d Spanich let his voice grow gruff, in his talking-to-idiot-techs tone. \u201cGet a new line.\u201d Gambling, he turned the kid with a hard tug on the shoulder and began walking him out like a drunk.\n\u201cMy son,\u201d she said from behind them.\nSpanich tapped the hatch panel. At least that control was normal in this freakish room. With a hiss, the wall slid open.\n\u201cAusten . . . \u201d\nHe propelled the kid out, marching him with an arm twist. Austen wasn\u2019t stumbling, though, which meant the heart hadn\u2019t completely gone out of him. The hatch hissed shut behind them, without the characteristic whick-whine of flechettes that Spanich\u2019s ears were straining for.\n\u201cEngineering Supervisor Spanich,\u201d said the shipmind. Its voice was tentative, a tone he\u2019d never heard from a starship.\n\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019re part of this, too.\u201d\nMare Imbrium {13 pairs} didn\u2019t say another word as they left the ship, left the transfer tube, left the berth lock, left the docking boom, and made their way back into the oily, cold passageways.\nWell away from the locks-and-docks sector, he finally let go of Austen. Kid would be bruised for sure. \u201cAlright then,\u201d Spanich said. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\u201cWh-what?\u201d Austen seemed dazed.\n\u201cSnap out of it, kid. You\u2019re free.\u201d Spanich swatted him on the ass. \u201cNow time to scoot.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\n\u201cSure you do. You\u2019ve been living on Estacada Orbital for months.\u201d Platinum-coated genetics or not, the kid had survived on his own. Hustling wasn\u2019t the worst way to live.\nAusten glanced back they way they\u2019d come.\n\u201cSure. Head back to Mare Imbrium thirteen if you want to.\u201d Spanich leaned close. \u201cBut on your own terms.\u201d Kid still smelled great. \u201cAnd whatever you do, drop the stupid act. You got more education than anyone on this station who isn\u2019t flash brass themselves. Damn well use it. At least be a smarter hustler.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d find me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHah. You\u2019re genetagged. Probably sniffed you out of the air recyclers, momma came running.\u201d Spanich paused, then probed. \u201cBut the big dogs don\u2019t know you\u2019re gone, do they?\u201d\n\u201cI th-thought I\u2019d got away clean.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why she came with Mare Imbrium thirteen, instead of a battalion of special forces from the Household Guards.\u201d\n\u201cRight. No scandal.\u201d\n\u201cYet,\u201d said Spanich. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been screwing the help, out here on big bad Estacada Orbital. Sullying yourself in the shallow waters of the gene pool.\u201d\nAusten nodded. \u201cSome things get erased.\u201d\nSpanich thought about that, hard. \u201cBut not the entire labor force of a station. Too many of us know you, know you\u2019ve been here a while.\u201d He patted the kid\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m grabbing my kit and shipping out as an engineer\u2019s mate in the next empty rack bound somewhere on the backside of this system. With a little luck I can get away before the Adjutant-Intendant puts out a warrant for my ass. You can stay here if you want, but you might consider the same.\u201d\n\u201cNo . . . \u201d Austen stood firm. \u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d\n\u201cAfter all the trouble I took to get you out?\u201d\nThe kid grinned, that old, easy smile flashing. \u201cBack on my own two feet, walking in to set what terms I can. Like you said. Besides, on Mare Imbrium I can do something about those warrants. Or Mother can, if I ask her nicely enough.\u201d\nNow that Austen had outed himself, he didn\u2019t seem to have any problem with the starship\u2019s name. Spanich gave him a long, slow stare. \u201cThen what, kid? You ran away from something? Sure you want to go back to it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d He looked around. \u201cBut what\u2019s here? They won\u2019t let me be. And you\u2019re right. I can be traced anywhere I\u2019m likely to be able to get.\u201d\nFor a brief moment, Spanich consider inviting Austen to berth out with him. It would be harder to sign on two, but not impossible. He shook off the idiocy, pulled the kid close for a rough kiss that mostly proved they both needed to shave, then took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m going, then. Good luck.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make it off Estacada Orbital,\u201d Austen said behind him. \u201cI\u2019ll see to that.\u201d\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better fucking hurry,\u201d muttered Spanich, but not loud enough for the kid to hear. He picked up his pace. There were maybe only a few minutes of freedom left. At the next junction, as he turned, Spanich glanced back. It would be just like the kid to be standing there, staring.\nBut no. A couple of off-shift sanitation techs, a trundlebot loaded down with something lumpy, and no sign of Austen, prince of the Imperium Humanum.\n\u201cWhat do you know?\u201d he asked no one in particular. \u201cSometimes they grow up.\u201d\nHe went for the rest of his tools and his gear. There was always room for a man who could torque vacuum, out here in the Deep Dark. All he had to do was live to not tell the tale.\nThe late Jay Lake was a highly talented and highly prolific writer who during his tragically short career seems to have managed to sell to nearly every market in the business, appearing with short work in Asimov's, Interzone, Tor.com, Clarkesworld, Strange Horizons, Aeon, Postscripts, Electric Velocipede, and many other markets, producing enough short fiction to fill five different collections: Greetings from Lake Wu, Green Grow the Rushes-Oh, American Sorrows, Dogs in the Moonlight, The Sky That Wraps, and, most recently, the posthumously released Last Plane from Heaven. Lake was also an acclaimed and prolific novelist, whose novels were Rocket Science, Trial of Flowers, Mainspring, Escapement, Green, Endurance, The Madness of Flowers, Pinon, and Kalimpura, as well as four chapbook novellas, Death of a Starship, The Baby Killers, The Specific Gravity of Grief, and Love in the Time of Metal and Flesh. He was the co-editor, with Deborah Layne, of the six-volume Polyphony anthology series, and also edited the anthologies All-Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories, with David Moles, Other Earths, with Nick Gevers, and Spicy Slipstream Stories, with Nick Mamatas.

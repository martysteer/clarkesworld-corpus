She certainly had something in mind, for she kissed my forehead before she left me, first brushing my dark, unruly locks aside. Then she told me to stay still, and ran off towards the road. It looked to me as though she slipped, though she was actress enough to do that on purpose.\nPerhaps she only meant to be maimed, slightly. Stories were told of mortals who had been restored after such accidents and given handsome gifts as well: metals, or strange fabrics. She may have been aiming for these riches.\nI didn\u2019t try to stop her, confident that she must know what she was doing. I was very proud of my mother; was she not the greatest glee-woman walking? She taught me all I knew.\nOf course, anyone who has passed a Fertility Trial is exceptional, but the thrilling tale my mother told of hers convinced me that she was without match. Apparently she agreed with me, for when she was fit for travel we spent very little time with my father and his people.\nI must have been about nine or so when we heard that my father\u2019s people had sent someone out to look for us. Or for me, to be more specific. They had been content to leave me in my mother\u2019s care at first, but I was now big enough to work strongly in the fields. Naturally, we decided to flee.\nWe took a raft a long way down a river, singing our way to Kimp Sinn, the city. It was said that the walls of Kimp Sinn were lined with foodholes, that one could see the gods on every corner. In a manner of speaking, these marvels were quite true.\nKimp Sinn is on an island in the sea. It is reached (unless you are a god) by a long, waltzing causeway. I still can remember the feeling of exhilaration we shared as my mother and I walked through the blue and white sky, gulls screaming around us.\nIn the city we found that many people had arrived there before us and were already well entrenched. The plenteous foodholes, which produced more than enough food for all, were controlled by certain individuals and groups. If no one could give them something of value in return for it, the food they could not eat was dumped into the sea. The gulls love Kimp Sinn. Their droppings white-wash the walls.\nAnd as for seeing the gods on every corner, that was almost right, for everywhere there were glowing colored squares busy with flickering images of the gods. Some of them were said to reside upon the mountains of the island. Once in a great while one of their little silver carriages would roll down the hollow god road . . .\nNot many considered our \u201csongs, dances, plays, and fooleries\u201d as worth watching above a moment, much less offering goods for the privilege. Not when they could watch the god shows for nothing. That first evening my mother traded her horn earrings for some dairy and ceery for us, some sweet for me, and a little smooth for herself. We had to trade again to get a roof space to sleep on.\nThe next day we learned to catch and kill rats. There were two foodholes in Kimp Sinn that operated only when a ratskin had been dropped in. The generous caretakers of these places inserted the ratskins for one, taking only part of the food for themselves. Thus we made our way in a place where our work meant nothing.\nWe were waiting for one of the ships that Kimp Sinn\u2019s natives boasted sometimes came calling to the port. None came for a long time. They told us it was because of storms, though the sea was calm as far as any could see. My mother believed them, she said, \u201cfor the sea is very big, Teekoige.\u201d At last a ship came, but it was going North, back toward my father\u2019s home.\nAs we waited for a Southern voyager, passing the days on the pier and the streets, hunting for rats and trading away our trinkets, I became aware of a secret interaction between my mother and a man named Obelk, one of those who took our ratskins. I got the feeling that he wished her to do something that she would rather not. It must have been something awful, or she would have told me about it, I am sure.\nMy mother cut off and traded her hair. I remember how heavy and dark it was, like sweet or sorghum.\nOne day Obelk refused to trade with us. The others did the same, at his foodhole and the other where ratskins were accepted. We could not even get fresh water.\nSo I know my mother was in a desperate state as we walked alongside the god road. But I do not know what was in her mind. I did not see her expression as she died.\nShe was thrown high into the air, then came thudding down in the road behind the slowing carriage. I ran screaming to her, but just as I reached her I was seized in a cold grip and lifted from her side. I stopped my screaming then, too frightened to breathe. I was carried to the carriage; up to a window in the wall, a window covered with glass.\nBehind the glass I saw a beautiful round white face, appearing to me like a full moon in the night. The moon smiled and said something I couldn\u2019t hear through the glass. The cold grip deposited me in a sort of bin at the back of the carriage, shutting the lid on me and plunging me into total darkness. I felt the carriage move.\nI finished crying for my mother. I knew that she must be dead. After the movement had stopped I was taken from the bin by the cold grip, which as I saw belonged to a tall, shiny man, astonishingly costumed all in metal. For some reason I could not fathom, I fell instantly asleep.\nWhen I awoke I was alone, and I felt far away from death, my mother, silver carriages, rats, Kimp Sinn, gulls, the moon, and myself. I know now this was the result of the chemicals with which I had been treated. I lay there then not knowing this and not caring. I finally got up because I had to pee. Hunkering over the slit, I noticed that my locks no longer fell over my shoulders. Feeling with my hand I found that an outrageously short fuzz was all I had covering my head. Also, I was naked (something that had not sunk in while I squatted peeing). I looked around for my clothes, but they were not in sight.\nThere was a mirror on one wall. At first I did not realize what it was, because I was unaccustomed to such large, clear mirrors. It showed me not only my bony face but my pitiful brown nakedness, the pale sea-colored walls behind me, the slit, the foodhole, and the bedmat from which I had just risen. It acted like a mirror, so I believed it was one. But suddenly it was no longer a mirror; it glowed like the god images on the walls of Kimp Sinn. Like a growing jewel, a picture of the moonface appeared, framed with lavender hair. I looked away.\n\u201cTeekoige!\u201d called the picture\u2019s voice. My name, I thought, but I did not respond. \u201cTeekoige? Teekoige!\u201d The image faded.\nI turned to the foodhole. It gave me some bean and veg and some nice flavored water. I did some stretches, automatically at first. As my body warmed up, my thoughts began to cohere. I went over recent events. My mother\u2019s death maintained its distance. It was like something I had been sad about a long time ago.\nOne heard of those who had been actually taken up by the gods. These rare individuals were never again seen by mortal eyes.\nIn a little while the square called me again. I ignored it. Then it threatened to shut off the foodhole and the sluice for the slit until I \u201clearned to mind my manners.\u201d This provoked me into answering that I did not need to use my manners to deal with a talking picture square. After a brief silence the light dimmed out and the mirror returned again.\nShortly, it began to move, opening inward like a door. I snatched up the sheet from the bedmat to wrap myself in it. I need not have bothered, though; my visitor was also naked. Her skin and hair shining, the god who had killed my mother (but it must have been a very long time ago) said hello to me, half frowning, half smiling.\n\u201cHello, Teekoige, then, if you will have no graven image,\u201d she addressed me.\n\u201cHello\u2014\u201d I replied, with a heavy pause.\nShe took her cue. \u201cAmma.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Amma, midam,\u201d I said, happy that my mother had taught me something of the ways of the gods. Amma is worshipped for her effect upon moods, storms, accidents, and sudden changes. I curtsied deeply.\n\u201cI am sorry about your mother, Teekoige,\u201d she said, as if that took care of everything. For her it did. For me it only brought the realization that my mother may not have been entirely responsible for her own death.\nAmma immediately wanted to know why I \u201cwould not speak with her over the vee,\u201d gesturing to the mirror. I could not answer her, so she continued. \u201cWhy did you manipulate me into coming here? Are you planning to kill me?\u201d she asked with a friendly sneer. \u201cNo, of course not; we both know that that is impossible. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI will do what you want me to do, midam,\u201d I replied slowly, \u201cbut I had no idea I should have treated that trick as though it were a real god. Such a thought never occurred in my head.\u201d I had a lot to learn.\nAmma, however, seemed well pleased with my answer. My ignorance was exactly what she wished for, \u201cfor I shall not have to unteach you a lot of tiresome misconceptions, like those city-bred mortals.\n\u201cMy dear girl,\u201d she went on, \u201cyou are absolutely perfect. Except for that horrible name.\u201d She clasped her hands together above her breasts, her nipples glowing like large rosy pearls. \u201cYou must have a stage name, something more mellifluous and resonant. Shiomah, that is it. Amma\u2019s Shiomah.\u201d\nAmma was a merry god, though capricious. Her form was always that of a beautiful, slightly plump woman with hair and skin of varying colors. She used also to remove part of the weight of her hair so that it floated up shimmering behind her head as she walked or glided along. She never cheapened her elegance with so much as a ring. This was a marked divergence from universal custom; even bioservs wore shorts or tunics or something.\nAmma created and recorded adventures and dramas that were highly popular among the gods. She had nothing to do with the pictures that moved on the corners of Kimp Sinn. Those, she told me, were Nyglu\u2019s idea, produced by machines.\nMachines are the gods\u2019 power. Machines give them their lives and their beauty. Amma showed me large and small machines, simple and complicated ones. Some are inside the gods, some embedded deep within the world, some fly constantly around the sky. Carriages, vees, foodholes, and servs are all machines. Machines speak and listen and reproduce and repair. They are toys and tools and objects of desire.\nAmma knew me inside out with the help of these machines. Silver circles embedded in her hand allowed her to instruct them as to her wishes. They gave her all my secrets as I slept. They whispered to me through my dreams, teaching me things I would not remember until I needed to know them. I wore a ring in my ear that spoke her commands to me when she herself was elsewhere.\nShe controlled me in many ways; at first through my awe and also, I later realized, by using the words and intonations of my mother. After a while I just wanted to please her, and for a very long time she did not even have to threaten me with the punishments she held in readiness.\nI controlled nothing, directly. I could not even cause a door to open until Amma ordered a serv to accompany me everywhere, operating its fellow machines for me. Even over this I had less than absolute power. It did nothing that conflicted with its basic paradigms, and often, at first, I gave it impossible instructions.\n\u201cGo drown yourself,\u201d I told it one day, in a foul mood after my sixth failure at forming a difficult construction in the Creative Mode (the gods\u2019 most difficult language). I knew perfectly well that the serv was operable under water, but I thought that it would at least try to obey me. Instead it put itself on standby, locking in place and emitting a distressed, hiccupping click. Some device must have alerted Amma, for she came into my room almost immediately, with another serv that deactivated and removed my companion.\n\u201cYou must not deliberately incapacitate my machines, Shiomah,\u201d she said, calm but stern. Her eyebrows lowered into a lovely frown. \u201cThis particular episode does not stem from ignorance, does it?\u201d I shook my head, chagrined. \u201cIf this continues, you will be denied all service.\u201d\nI glanced around my quarters. They were pleasant: sand-colored, papery-feeling walls, russet and amber appointments, wide windows from which to see the sea. Still, it was no place in which to be involuntarily confined. But I did manage to confound my serv on one other occasion, though not exactly intentionally. It was just that I couldn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t miss my mother more, and I thought perhaps if I had something tangible to mourn . . .\nThis time two units came; one to attend to the damaged serv, the other to accompany me to Amma\u2019s tower. I followed it up, a heavy lump of apprehension inside my chest refusing to respond to the lift of the glide-way.\nA rain the color of peridots curtained the entrance to my mistress\u2019 apartment. I stepped through. As sometimes happened, the rain failed to cease falling, and I was drenched.\nThe sun was at its zenith, and the iris of the tower\u2019s ceiling had contracted to a slit. Below its short overhang, a long window curved continuously, circled by blue sky. Amma sat with her pale green legs curled beneath her, bent forward to look at a display board set in the floor. Raising her face to me, she seemed about to laugh at my wetness, but then a deliberate lack of expression smoothed away the beginnings of her dimples. I took a towel from a knob on the wall behind me and dried myself as I went to sit before her.\n\u201cYou sent your serv to bring you your mother\u2019s remains,\u201d she half asked, half stated.\n\u201cYes, midam.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew the task would be difficult. Did you know how difficult?\u201d\n\u201cI thought that it could ask for assistance; take a carriage; make inquiries.\u201d\n\u201cInquiries of the gulls? Assistance from the herring? What do you suppose has become of your mother in all the time I have had you?\u201d Her questions brought up that strange numbness in me, stronger than ever, a broad, flat humming that drowned out my answer as I formed it. I suppose I must have imagined the citizens of Kimp Sinn taking her away, burning her, urning her ashes. But the overwhelming nothing that I felt negated all possibilities. I hung my head in silence, ashamed of my speechlessness. How could I know that she had suggested this, had planted in my mind this bland substitute for grief?\n\u201cI will tell you what happened, my dear,\u201d Amma said, perhaps moved to some sort of divine contrition by my dumbness. \u201cShe was removed and disintegrated by the road\u2019s maintenance mechanisms. By now she is scattered far and wide, and still dispersing.\u201d\nShe paused, her soft green fingers touching me under my chin, tilting my head upwards. \u201cYou were asking for all the birds of the air, all the fish in the sea, every blade of grass upon the dunes, every sandcrab on the beach.\u201d She stopped again, holding my eyes with hers. \u201cWhy did not you ask me?\u201d\nThe spell of numbness had passed at her touch, but still I couldn\u2019t answer. It had come to me that Amma did not want me to have a mother, alive or dead. How could I tell a god she was jealous of a mortal?\n\u201cWhy did you not take her up in your carriage, with me?\u201d I asked, neglecting to use the honorific. Her eyes narrowed, measuring me closely.\n\u201cI thought you might be of use to me,\u201d she replied, dropping her arm, \u201cbut I saw no need to carry around a corpse. Would it have been pleasant for you, in that dark, unfamiliar place, crowded in with your mother\u2019s body? I wanted you in the best shape possible, confident, unbroken, trusting yourself against the unknown.\u201d She stood suddenly, and raised me delicately with her fingertips. \u201cEven in shock, your face seemed so dazzlingly young, yearning to see me through my window . . . I thought you might be of use to me,\u201d she repeated, \u201cand it begins to look as though I was right.\u201d Affirming her own good judgment, she nodded, smiling a small but brilliant smile.\nTo please her, I learned. I learned the shape of the world and the depth of the skies and their ways. I learned the gods\u2019 habits and slow history. Sometimes I came upon obstacles in my search for knowledge: blank walls or steps built up into empty air. Amma approved of my frustration as a sign of my curiosity, helping me when she could and promising that in time I would know all.\nContrary to what my mother had taught me, I learned that individual gods do die. If they are not done in by one of their peers or by some accident during one of their frequent flirtations with death, they do themselves in. Five hundred years is the average lifespan. Many extend this several times, however, by being reborn.\nBut even this measure can only temporarily rescue a world-weary god. Sooner or later one particular copy will develop such a deeply ingrained disgust for the futile repetitions that the process is discontinued.\nI discovered that the gods did not take such a deep interest in the affairs of mortals as was generally supposed. The interest was sporadic, shallow, a matter of fashion. During one of the periods when it was considered stylish to notice mortals, the causeway and the city of Kimp Sinn were built, the scattered foodholes installed about the land to supplement the crops, the Fertility Trials viewed avidly. But the divine population of the island had been steadily decreasing, the wonder of mortal ways having palled centuries ago for most.\nThe exception to this was the ancient river god, Nyglu, the aforementioned producer of the vee shows of Kimp Sinn. He was also the innovator of the ratskin-trading foodhole. Nyglu\u2019s all-consuming passion was the study of mortals, by means of any and all disciplines. Considered by most a boring eccentric, Nyglu was included in Amma\u2019s circle partly because of some obscure genetic relationship between the two and partly, I think, because of Amma\u2019s taste for the odd and sensational.\nThroughout their friendship she had humored his harmless pastimes, learning mortal speech at his insistence. Hearing of my acquisition, he had made her promise that I would be introduced to him at the first opportunity.\nAmma held back on this for some time. She relieved me of some of my awe and fed my own good opinion of myself until she felt I was ready. It was her plan that I should confront Nyglu with at least an elementary knowledge of the gods\u2019 languages and etiquettes, and with all my native audacity intact.\nThe meeting took place in my own quarters: familiar ground for me, new to my interviewer. He stared as though he would like to trap me on his sticky tongue. His eyes glittered beneath large, horny ridges. His skin was rough, wrinkled, and sprinkled with warts. He addressed me in First Speech, the one used with low-order mechanisms and bioservs. \u201cIs it good that you are Amma\u2019s Shiomah?\u201d\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t be cleaner,\u201d I replied, using the latest Juvenile Swerve. I switched to Obligatory Contract. \u201cI understand that the information I represent carries some value to you, Mr. Nyglu?\u201d\nHe actually blinked. Then we got down to negotiations, which went very much, I thought, in my favor. Credit goes to Amma for coaching me in being able to read the face of one so\u2014different. But Nyglu had never needed to be shrewd, as I and my mother had. It was like bargaining with soft wax.\nAmma was delighted with the outcome. She rewound the contract and played it through after Nyglu had gone, chuckling at the extent of my boldness. \u201cSo he actually paid you for the recordings I made when I found you, before you first woke up? He might have gotten those as a gift from me, had he asked.\u201d\n\u201cBut I gave him no time to think of asking. And you said that I could offer them, midam.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but it was your idea. And so was this performance you scheduled. I suppose you will need to use a bioserv for at least part of it.\u201d\n\u201cIf I may.\u201d\nShe glanced at me from the corner of one mirthful eye. \u201cOf course you may. I wouldn\u2019t miss it for an asteroid.\u201d She returned to scanning the contract. \u201cVery good, especially this last part.\u201d\n\u201cThe consultant clause?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Nyglu has never been able to get anyone to wade through his material before, so you flatter him, even at this price.\u201d\nIt bothered me for awhile that I had not asked for a higher fee to review his work, but as my mother always said, it does no harm to have your customer feel he\u2019s gotten the best of the deal. And I certainly did well with what I had won.\nThe gods lived in weary anarchy, most having rubbed away the edges of their more troublesome desires by way of fulfillment, long ago. Aesthetic and social pressures exercised the only control. Any serious problems that developed (usually with the younger deities) were dealt with by somewhat interested parties, informal groups with as much license to punish the offenders as their own level of annoyance allowed.\nUnder Amma\u2019s protection I had just about any rights she chose to give me. She bestowed upon me all the privileges and powers she thought I could grasp. I set out to increase my earthly store with an earnest intensity that my protectress found amusing. To the gods, wealth is no more than a diversion. I was a bottomless coinpurse, an everladen tablecloth, for Amma.\nShe adored the havoc my childish temper and unconventional questions wreaked upon her circle of acquaintances. These occurrences were a little like my earlier effects upon the servs, but for some reason she found them much less irritating.\nFor instance, once she brought me with her to try out a new toy, a boat a lover had just given her. The lover, a minor god without physical affectations, was called Weyando. He was on board to demonstrate the boat\u2019s principles of operation, as he was the engineer of both the hull and the living sail. Also present was a certain young Lizore, related somehow to Weyando, and apparently to be my charge should Amma and Weyando find themselves too busy to attend to her.\nHad she been a mortal I would have judged Lizore to be about four years of age. Actually she had just turned twenty-five, though she was still considered a child by divine standards. Although she appeared properly aloof in the presence of Weyando, her eyes took on a more interested expression the moment she was left in my care.\n\u201cHurry, show me,\u201d she asked at once. \u201cAre your genitals like mine?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhat,\u201d I admitted. \u201cWould you like to look at them, midam?\u201d\n\u201cYes, I just said so,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI suppose you will want to see mine? All right, then.\u201d She reached for the hem of her shift.\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cjust tell me something, please. Answer a question.\u201d\n\u201cA question you shouldn\u2019t ask?\u201d I nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d\n\u201cWhat relation are you to Weyando?\u201d Even I was astounded by my daring. Held distinct from sexual practices, the reproductive secrets of the gods are exactly that. Secrets. This was one of the topics upon which Amma had adamantly insisted that I remain uneducated. Any bioserv that became precocious enough to be coaxed into speculation upon the subject promptly disappeared.\nLizore\u2019s steely eyes glinted with new respect as she answered me. \u201cHis eggson is my spermfather.\u201d She looked up at me expectantly, and I nodded in a show of understanding, lifting my hem to her examination.\n\u201cWe are very nearly identical,\u201d she reported, in a disappointed voice.\nI was quite as dissatisfied with my end of the bargain, until Amma explained Lizore\u2019s terms and others just as confusing. But that was much later, when she asked me to have her child.\nWeyando\u2019s gift was a success. The water foamed and hissed away below us, constantly changing into itself, showing all the colors of my mistress\u2019 moods. The sun warmed the sail, which turned itself constantly to the heat, a billowing net filled with a wind of light. At night soft breezes pushed against its unfurled membranes, sailing us through the phosphorescent dark.\nDay or night, Amma and Weyando were together: guiding the ship, gazing into each others eyes, satisfying themselves with one another\u2019s sight, or sound, or smell, or touch, or taste.\nLizore and I were much in each other\u2019s company. Five days after our first encounter, I posed a question with an impact that far outweighed that of the first one I had asked. As Lizore and I silvered ourselves with glittering scales from the hull, she laughed at some witless pun I made. \u201cReally, Shiomah,\u201d she giggled, \u201cyou\u2019re not at all boring. I find it hard to believe you are a mortal.\u201d She said it to praise me, so I tried to hide my offended pride, but my reply came sharply.\n\u201cIf we mortals are so boring, midam, why did you gods bother to create us? If we are inferior, we are your work.\u201d The paradox struck Lizore just as if I had slapped her baby-fat cheeks. Mortals, she had been taught, were tacky. Stupid, clumsy, disease-ridden\u2014they were all this, and a great deal more that was anything but necessary.\n\u201cCome,\u201d she ordered, heading for the stern. At our approach, her spermfather\u2019s eggfather locked the controls and turned to her trouble-filled face. Amma lifted herself up from the deck on one elbow, watching with the expression of one about to be entertained. \u201cWeyando,\u201d Lizore asked, \u201cwhy do we need mortals? What did we make them for?\u201d A short but devastated silence followed.\nAmma rose from her languid pose. \u201cI\u2019ll call the copter,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut why did . . . \u201d Lizore started again querulously.\n\u201cLater,\u201d Weyando told her, with a quelling and emphatic glance in my direction.\nAfter her guests left, Amma began to laugh aloud, tickling my ribs till I joined her. Her voice sounded like a wind chime, the separate notes hanging in the air and striking one another like strung shells, soft yet clear.\nWhen we had calmed down a bit, she made me sit with her on a little wooden bench. Then she took me by both hands and explained at length why my question had caused such discomfort.\n\u201cThe gods do not need mortals at all. For any reason.\u201d At times, she said, there had even been crusades to have them wiped out. \u201cBut that\u2019s not at all fashionable now,\u201d Amma reassured me.\n\u201cAnd\u2014\u201d I coaxed her, knowing there must be more.\n\u201cYes. Go ahead.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the gods did not make the mortals.\u201d\nShe nodded, pleased at my quickness. \u201cThe gods\u2014were mortals, at one time.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not general knowledge. Especially not among children. But, yes, our remote ancestors and yours are one, the same.\u201d Her cheeks dimpled; she was fond of the unorthodox, and I piqued her with my impertinence.\n\u201cNo doubt these facts had a bearing on the defeat of the drive for our extermination, midam.\u201d She nodded, eyes and hands suddenly intent upon disentangling some snarl in my hair. I continued my conjectures silently for a moment as we skimmed over the still sea.\nI myself could see the advantages of maintaining some sort of gene pool. I asked her whether there were any mortals who had been made into gods. I had in mind those who had been \u201ctaken up\u201d before me, and of whom I had never heard or seen anything during my time with the gods.\nShe answered me with irritating equivocation. \u201cYes. Well, no, not really, although in a way, yes.\u201d I begged saucily for her to be more explicit.\n\u201cYou know how we grow ourselves again, after we are dead?\u201d I did. \u201cWell, sometimes that is done with mortal flesh, and we turn them into a god that way.\u201d I thought it a rather crooked path to immortality, but I could not disapprove of it when I reflected upon the sort of god that Obelk the rat-trader would make.\nI thought again of the foodholes and those who held command over them when I went for the first time to one of Nyglu\u2019s mudrooms. At all his homes he had these moist, dark retreats.\nWhile reviewing here what he had written (more material was available for my scrutiny now that Amma had made the mortal origins of the gods explicit), I asked him his opinion of Kimp Sinn.\nHe seemed unsure at first of how to answer. \u201cIt works well enough, I think,\u201d he equivocated, paddling his webbed feet in a dark pond.\n\u201cWell enough at what?\u201d I asked impatiently. I sat cross-legged atop a table of long stone slabs, the driest spot I could find. \u201cWhat is this city of the gods supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2014you see, it provides a goal for the ambitious, and even for the less motivated an example\u2014\u201d he broke off and glanced up at me shyly \u201c\u2014of the beauty of our relationship.\u201d\n\u201cOur relationship?\u201d I asked incredulously. We spoke Modal Society, but business still formed the main basis of our intercourse, as far as I was concerned.\n\u201cI speak generally, of course,\u201d Nyglu hastened to assure me. \u201cOf the relationship between mortals and the gods, the gentle mentoring, the poignant reminder of our slower yet always inevitable decline, experienced in miniature before our eyes by your own people.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d From the divine vantage, all our petty strivings, Obelk\u2019s and my mother\u2019s and those of me myself must look equally vain, foolish, and pointless, and harmless on the whole. \u201cHow old are you, Nyglu?\u201d Another of my tactless questions, with a wholly unexpected answer.\nNyglu flopped down on his knees before me. \u201cWhat matters the difference in our years, charming child? My love for you is ageless.\u201d\nI felt lost. Was this a scene from some play in my repertoire? My lines, what were they? Cautiously, I extended my hands. It took a moment for the god to look up from his submissive pose. Then he seized my palms in his slippery grip and touched them several times with his sticky tongue. I withdrew quickly, disguising my disgust.\n\u201cAmma,\u201d I managed to pant out in my fright and confusion. \u201cShe must not discover us.\u201d And I felt this to be true, no mere excuse for separating myself from him.\n\u201cOh, sweetness, surely not,\u201d he said, his voice sad with longing at the loss of contact. \u201cI can conceal our involvement from her. Trust me. Trust in my powers. Oh, Shiomah, we could make each other so happy.\u201d I didn\u2019t think so. But I let him touch me, just a little. Just a little more.\nIt was not too long after this that I progressed to the point where Amma felt I was of some use to her in her dramas. I played first for her the role of Juusli, a young god who rebels against the ennui of immortality by refusing to behave in a socially responsible manner. Among Juusli\u2019s foibles was a refusal to allow her body to age into puberty. The piece was years in the making, so Amma had my growth temporarily halted.\nWeyando came back to play the part of Jez, a more conventionally-minded contemporary of Juusli\u2019s. No mention was made of the way that I had provoked Lizore\u2019s speculative outburst, but he did not bring his eggson\u2019s eggwife\u2019s daughter to play with me again.\nThe part of Jez\u2019s spouse, whom Juusli spends much of the piece trying to seduce, was filled by a beautiful bioserv that Amma referred to as a dryad. Amma spent much time with this pale and lovely creature, giving it detailed instructions covering every nuance of its role. The dryad would try to follow her directions exactly, and if the results were not desirable, Amma would once more go over the entire action, changing it if necessary.\nSometimes I believed that the dryad performed poorly on purpose, simply to deprive me of my mistress\u2019 time. Professional pride kept me from following its example.\nWe spun around the globe, recording different parts of the story in different areas: ruins, deserts, the homes of friends, jungles, lakes, glaciers . . . I saw that the sea was large, that mortals counted for nothing against the world\u2019s immensity. And that though outnumbered six-hundred-to-one, the divine five thousand leave more of a mark upon the earth than the mortal three million, because they are more able to work on the world\u2019s scale.\nThere was a valley along a dead, dry river. All soil had been stripped from the land by some bored deity, and the bedrock had then been chiseled into tunnels and spires, a maze for the wind. Low, shuddering groans and high sounds that yearned to become music played around us there. Haunting murmurs and keening whistles accompanied every scene. It was easy to portray Juusli\u2019s essential loneliness in this land that mourned for itself.\nOnce I looked up from the action of one of these scenes and saw to my surprise that tears fell from Amma\u2019s eyes. When she signaled an end to the session, I followed her to the other edge of the plateau we worked upon. As we walked she seemed oblivious to me, but reaching the drop-off she stopped and called me to her.\nHer tears left starry trails on her indigo skin, shining like her hyalescent hair. \u201cYour performance is quite moving, Shiomah,\u201d she told me in a low, steady voice. \u201cI am proud.\u201d So was I, for the scene just completed had been rather difficult. Juusli was struggling with the ghosts of her dead selves as they urged her to fling herself to another death. The difficulty lay in creating the physical impression of resistance while wrestling with the air. Departing from her usual procedure, Amma had chosen to screen-animate these devils after the recording, rather than manufacture bioservs which would only be demolished during their plunge into the canyon below. I was glad to have met this challenge so well, but I didn\u2019t think Amma cried for joy in my competence. I waited and hoped for an explanation.\nInstead she asked, \u201cIf I were to assure you, Shiomah, that you would be given immortality if only you jumped over the edge of this plateau, would you do it?\u201d\nI thought of my mother, tossed high into the air, dead, no doubt, before she hit the ground. \u201cNo.\u201d I paused, weighing my position. \u201cOf course I would have to, if you commanded me to, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u201cBut you have already answered my question,\u201d she stated, dismissing mine. \u201cHere is another. If I asked you to throw me down there, would you?\u201d I started to speak, but she continued. \u201cIf I did not tell you to, but asked, with no authority.\u201d\nI could not picture autocratic, arbitrary Amma with no authority, though I tried. \u201cWhat would become of me, if I did?\u201d I inquired.\nMy mistress laughed, all melancholy suddenly gone from her manner. \u201cYou funny thing! So selfish, so practical. Never mind. I will not ask you to kill me, for you would surely find it an annoying task.\u201d Taking my hand, she returned with me to the others.\nA later sequence was recorded on Nyglu\u2019s estate. Before his current obsession took hold of him, Nyglu had been fascinated with the order of amphibians, as his personal appearance showed. Perhaps this is why mortals associated him with rivers, and with fresh water in general. He certainly associated himself with it. Pools, bogs, swamps, and wet places of all sorts made up the bulk of his \u201cgrounds.\u201d When we visited he still took great pride in showing the estate to his visitors, pointing out the particular species he had reconstructed from his studies. Some were immense and ugly, others small and subtle, effacing themselves into the dark, decaying backdrop.\nThere were also experiments, whims come to life. My favorites were the triphibians, a sort of winged salamander. Mottled scarlet and sky blue, one came and perched briefly on my arm then skimmed away. Seeing my delight, Nyglu hatched three eggs for me, and I spent my free time feeding and observing the larvae. Soon I had tame triphibians of my own, but I had to leave them behind when we went to the moon. Nyglu promised that they would be mine again when we returned.\nThe dryad was packed away in her trunk, and we coptered off to meet Amma\u2019s sky shuttle. Weyando stayed behind; his character, Jez, didn\u2019t appear in the final scenes. As we floated away from the world, its immensity was belittled.\nWe spent a long time in orbit because of a hitch in the preparations for our landing. An ancient resort on the moon\u2019s surface was to have been restored to habitability without destroying the period flavor of the setting. Some too authentic material used in the repairs had ruptured and released most of the complex\u2019s air. The old oxygen machines below the surface had long since been dismantled, and regular flights to and from Earth had stopped decades ago, at the end of the last space craze. It was a couple of days before more air was brought up. Trouble arose, due, in part, to our long confinement on board the shuttle.\nIn preparing me for the profession she had chosen for me, that of acting roles in her creations, Amma had given me access to all sorts of old cubes and reels. After I used up all the sleep tapes, she even taught me to read; not pictos like mortal writing, but words composed of letters, like these. While examining some written antiquities during the delay, I learned with real shock that the Earth had once been almost literally covered with mortals.\nI ran to Amma in her cabin, craved to see her, was quickly admitted. What atrocity, I demanded of my mistress, had reduced the mortal population fifty-thousand-fold? As I asked this, I actually clutched Amma\u2019s elbow to stop her from turning away from me. She froze.\nI whipped my hand away, startled at what I had just done. I had tried to use force to press my will upon a divinity.\nBut when she again faced me, she was smiling. Sadly. As if she had expected this to happen, while at the same time hoping that it never would. As though I had pleased and pained her both, at once. \u201cI will answer you, Shiomah,\u201d she said, \u201cbut first I am going to show you something. Something I ought to have shown you long ago.\u201d She extended her left hand.\nNot for the first time I noticed that the sides of her fingers and the edges of her palm were lined with numerous shining dots. \u201cActivation of one of these circuits,\u201d she told me, \u201cwill wipe out a selected memory in your brain. I have chosen your mother\u2019s name.\u201d She let this sink in, then went on.\n\u201cActivation of a second will deprive you of the use of the centers of conscious volition. And the third,\u201d she promised, \u201cwill prevent the operation of your autonomic systems. Do you understand me?\u201d\nI nodded. \u201cYes, midam.\u201d\n\u201cNow. There was no disaster, no epidemic, no mass murder of mortals. The current population, my dear, is a result of time and care and thoughtful planning.\u201d She made gestures with her hands like a prince in a story, dispensing coins to a crowd. \u201cBirth control, ample food, lebensraum\u2014the ancient fifty billion never had it so good.\u201d I still had a lot to learn.\nIt was difficult after the revelation of these threats to reassume the role of Juusli, a character whose last motivation is fear. With relief I removed my pressure suit in the simulated vacuum of the closing act, the heroine succumbing to the hallucinatory call of dust sirens. It was an ambiguous ending, with Juusli unharmed, drifting away with the sirens (specially made bioservs, of course), leaving a sparkling trail of palpable looking dust.\nWhen we returned to Earth, Amma let me age again, though more slowly than mortals are accustomed to do. She used me in other, smaller works, or in the social games she played with the other gods. Sometimes she devoted her enormous energies to my training, sometimes she seemed merely to relax and enjoy my company. Her attentions were far from constant. I would be ignored for months, a year at a time, then taken up again without, apparently, a beat skipped.\nOne afternoon, when I had been with her nearly fifteen years, she fancied she would make love with me. My body was that of a fourteen-year-old, an awkward, pudgy beauty, but she was attracted. How can the gods ever tire of such pleasure?\nIn time our desire was heightened by a burgeoning love. My adoration was natural, inevitable even. I think I had only been waiting to release it until I received some sign from her.\nAs to why she loved me I can only say that not even mortal passions are easily subjected to analysis. Amma\u2019s love was fierce\u2014and ridiculous, on the face of it. I still had pimples, at times. My nose was too long. I thought perhaps she confused me with Juusli, the first character she had created for me.\nNo deity questioned Amma\u2019s absorption with me. Such fascinations were not unheard of. Sometimes the infatuated god went as far as actually regrowing the mortal undeified, merely in faithful reduplication of the beloved original.\nThose foolish gods. They should have known that this would not be enough for Amma.\nShe contrived to have me conditioned into partial godhood while growing and then secretly disposing of the expected replacement. Immortality was given to me for as long as I can stand it, and the powers of the god machines were made mine.\nThe sins of my \u201cmortal counterpart\u201d were not visited upon the new Shiomah. Weyando\u2019s eggson\u2019s spermdaughter was again allowed into the circle of my influence. Others that I had alienated upon Amma\u2019s instructions made me welcome in my new guise, with calls of congratulation and invitations to their estates. With all this obligatory gaiety, it was almost a year before we settled in again back on the island.\nAmma became more and more attentive. She involved me in the details of her creations, seeking advice on costume and dialogue for her daring depiction of a god in mortal disguise. I decided to have my rooms dismantled, as I spent nearly all my time in hers. Everything was packed away except the terminal when she came to me with her offer of marriage.\nI stared at her across the wide, bare floor. She was colored all turquoise, with hair like ethereal jade. She clashed horribly with what was left of the decor.\n\u201cWell?\u201d she asked, a little sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be my wife?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes, yes Amma,\u201d I managed to reply. Since being deified I no longer referred to my mistress as \u201cmidam.\u201d \u201cI do, I\u2019ll be so happy, I\u2019ll make you so happy, only I am very much surprised . . . \u201d I trailed off. I came towards her, one eye on the terminal\u2019s screen. I did love her, and it meant so much to me to please her. She kissed the top of my head and clasped me to her.\n\u201cYou should be used to receiving surprises from me by now,\u201d she said as she released me, smiling. \u201cIn time, you will grow accustomed to my ways, and come to find me quite boring, no doubt.\u201d\nI shook my locks in vigorous dissent. \u201cNever, no, never, Amma.\u201d I took her hands in mine and kissed each sea-colored fingertip, saying \u201cYou are so sweet, so generous, so full of precious secrets\u2014\u201d I came to one of the little silver circles with which she controlled her underlings.\n\u201cOh, yes, that reminds me,\u201d she said when I did not continue. \u201cI almost forgot to tell you. I\u2019m going to have those signals removed, those ones I told you about on the moon.\u201d I met her eyes. They were dark, gravely serious in her expressive face.\n\u201cThe ones you said could erase my memory or destroy my nervous system?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cSo. Now that you\u2019ve consented to engage yourself to me, there\u2019s no danger of those circuits ever being engaged.\u201d She grinned, suddenly in an impish mood, and I perceived the pun (no pun at all in mortal speech) almost at the same time as I saw the call light blink on the com screen. Pretending to be disgusted with the lowness of her humor, I managed to shove her playfully through the door before she noticed the flashing signal.\nAs I had expected, it was Nyglu. His warty face showed satisfaction to my trained eyes. \u201cI have the body,\u201d he reported, \u201cand the other arrangements are underway.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d I told him. With the passage of time I had grown used to my deepening contact with Nyglu and the leverage it gave me. \u201cThen you may count on my presence in your mudroom\u2014\u201d I hesitated. Amma had planned to leave for Nyglu\u2019s estate this evening, but there was no telling when I\u2019d be left alone there, now that we were betrothed. \u201cWhenever I can come without Amma knowing,\u201d I hastily amended. Nyglu looked like he wanted to protest, but to whom? Not to me. I switched off the screen and went looking for my mistress.\nWe were wed in a short but impressive ceremony aboard the ship Amma had been given by Weyando. I begged her to wear some form of clothing, and at last she compromised by causing her hair to cling to her nakedness, covering almost all the right places. By contrast, I was draped in fluttering, dune-colored fabrics designed to hide the tiny scars and other imperfections my body carried. True, we might have said that Amma had caused my replacement to be grown bearing these marks, but I desired to avoid explanations.\nThe wind sang in the rigging, our only choir. The sky, as ever in those latitudes, was a vaulted dome of blue. The child Lizore joined our hands as we pledged our love, \u201cas long as its life continues.\u201d After kissing one another\u2019s eyelids, we turned to bestow our wedding gifts upon our guests, all of whom, at Amma\u2019s insistence, were present.\nAs we passed among her friends and relatives, Amma made sketchy introductions to those I had not yet met. \u201cHayvre, Lizore\u2019s eggmother,\u201d she named one black, black woman who reached out to clasp my hand in one sporting two thumbs. \u201cElleefaw\u201d was a tiny, shaggy, sexless looking god in spiked heels. I recognized the name as belonging to the deity of unpleasant truths.\n\u201cHe makes the best monuments. We used the Hill of Glass in my last piece, Elleefaw,\u201d she said to the short, red-furred god. \u201cIt was perfect, especially the way it opens and closes like an eye.\u201d Elleefaw nodded his approval of this tribute, running his own sharp eye up and down my pudgy awkwardness. I felt uneasy in his presence, and I wasn\u2019t made more comfortable by the remark he made as he walked way. \u201cNow you\u2019ll each find out what the other is really like,\u201d he announced over his shoulder, clip-clopping off across the deck. But surely we had learned all that in over twenty years?\nI was glad to see Nyglu, preferring his familiar strangeness to these upsetting new acquaintances. Our encounters had been curtailed since the betrothal, and he was glad to stay by my side when I asked him to, as a sort of buffer.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you couldn\u2019t broadcast the ceremony like everyone else does,\u201d he complained to us in a mildly fretful tone. \u201cBut I must admit that I am enjoying myself,\u201d he added politely (and perhaps also to prevent Amma from detecting his morose jealousy).\nMy mistress hadn\u2019t explained to me her reasons for an in-person celebration, but now she said, \u201cThis one isn\u2019t for show. This one is going to last.\u201d With a fond look she walked away from me, taking our glasses to be filled with the bright, frothy drink that was being served.\nStill disturbed by Elleefaw\u2019s pronouncement, I was silent until Nyglu wondered out loud if anything was wrong. \u201cDo you think everything will change now?\u201d I asked him. I expected denial. His precarious happiness, his treasured times with me, would work to keep him from accepting the possibility of a different course in our lives.\nInstead, he shrugged, resigned. \u201cChange,\u201d Nyglu answered, \u201cis Amma\u2019s only constant.\u201d\nFor several months after our marriage, all remained the same. I continued to work for Amma as before, to make furious or languid love with her, to study and transact my own business. I acquired islands, asteroids, and watersheds entirely my own, as well as other, less common commodities. Nyglu took care of this for me, with all the discretion I relied upon him for.\nThen Amma decided that we were going to have a child. The new Shiomah might have asked upon deification how gods were born. Perhaps Amma attributed my lack of curiosity on the subject to habits formed in earlier days. I could hardly tell her of my source. Instead, I massaged her hands, pulling and stroking her pale violet fingers as she recited the possibilities to the tower\u2019s open ceiling, full of stars.\n\u201cWe can mate as mortals do,\u201d she whispered, \u201cor we can let machines do it for us. Two males can join genetic material, or two females. We can mate with ourselves or with those long dead. Just as soon as you\u2019re ready,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ll start taking the enzymes that neutralize the sterilizing compounds.\u201d She sighed as I dug into the fleshy mound beneath her thumb.\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked. But in answer Amma held her hand to my mouth and brought mine in turn to her delicately nipping teeth. Her excitement at the thought of conception made further details impossible to come by until dawn.\nWhat Amma offered me was the opportunity to impose my genetic message over that of a microscopic animal. The animal would then be injected into a donated sperm cell, and the sperm cell would join with an egg of hers. This was fine with me; I leapt at the chance for another sort of immortality. Amma and I disagreed on only one important point; I wanted her to carry the baby in her own body. Even for just a short while. She would not; not even her innate love of the curious made pregnancy appealing to her.\nI offered to bear the child within my own body. She pointed out that to do so would endanger the lie we lived. \u201cOnly a mortal would allow itself to be invaded in such a manner,\u201d she declared hotly. Anyway, what did it matter that our wombs were empty; we would still be mothers as the gods saw things.\nIt mattered to me.\nWeeks passed. I took to sulking in my old refuge, the brown and russet rooms I had occupied before our marriage. Gradually I brought the furnishings out of storage, determined to be comfortable in the midst of my self-imposed exile. I avoided Amma, keeping to my own apartments as much as possible.\nFinally she came to me, persuasive and proud. I slouched on my couch seat, not looking up as she lowered herself beside me.\n\u201cDon\u2019t pout, Shiomah,\u201d she said, putting an arm around me. She laughed. \u201cI could walk to Kimp Sinn on your lower lip.\u201d That made me smile, but I quickly pretended that I never had.\n\u201cOur ways are better, you will see,\u201d she continued, coaxingly. Pale blue, she rested like a piece of sky on the brown slopes of my shoulders.\nI shook her arm off, standing up and walking away angrily. \u201cYour ways? You have no ways. You do nothing except let things be done for you.\u201d In the silence that followed I felt the presence of Elleefaw, happy that we did no better than he had expected.\n\u201cOh, Amma,\u201d I said remorsefully, turning back to her again.\n\u201cWhy do you oppose my will?\u201d She was displeased that I had a will, rather than a mere collection of childish whims, that I had walked away from her, that I stood and she sat. Seeing this, I knelt, thus allowing her to continue to be gracious.\n\u201cHave I not treated you well, my dear?\u201d she asked. Her fingers sought my hair, toyed with my tangles. \u201cHave I not given you everything you ever desired, and more?\u201d No, I thought, for my mother is gone, and you refuse to take her place. Deaf to my inner voice, Amma continued to talk of how she had spoiled me, ignorant of my deepening resolve.\n\u201cSo you must understand,\u201d she concluded, \u201cthat it will be best for both of us if you yield to me in this.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, and her hand ceased fondling my locks. \u201cIf you make a child this way, it will be without my consent. You will have to kill me then, to keep me from confessing our crime.\u201d\nShe stood, pushing me away from her. Her celestial face paled, a touch of cirrus in the sky. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean it,\u201d she said, quietly appalled. Bestowing immortality directly upon a mortal, as she had done, was inconceivable; the punishment for our deception would be of a kind with it. The gods are jealous.\n\u201cBut I do mean it,\u201d I said, rising and meeting her eyes without wavering. \u201cNo machine or half-animal is going to carry our child, Amma, not while I live.\u201d\nShe stared until she saw that I was in earnest. Then, for the first time in my life I experienced divine wrath. She stamped the floor with one lovely foot and clenched her fists in front of her angrily heaving breast. \u201cYou fool!\u201d she shouted, purple smudging her pale blue cheeks. She laughed harshly, metallically, an untuned gamelon. \u201cYou funny, funny fool.\u201d Then she activated the first of the three circuits she had shown me years ago as we orbited the moon and had, of course, never disabled.\nMy mother\u2019s name is gone, removed from my mind and all my records. And the erasure is permanent and self-reinforcing. Even if someone told me what my mother was called, I would forget the sounds as soon as they were said. Even if I wrote her name here as it was spoken, I would forget it as soon as it was read.\nAmma is a capricious god, but thorough.\nBut shrewd as I am, I had made my preparations. Even as she was proving her remorse by destroying her other controls, I left and fled here.\nI do not know if she was fooled by the death of my double. Nyglu was careful, but perhaps she will discover that he hid it for me when she thought she\u2019d had it destroyed.\nPerhaps she will not be deceived. Perhaps she will come and test my defenses. For all I can tell, though, she is even now working on another Shiomah, perhaps one just a little less hard-headed. I left her plenty of tissue samples.\nIt was foresight that made me search out this corner of the world, rich in plant life and rare minerals. It is mine through my efforts, and I have stocked it with my treasures. My horses, and cattle, and machines, and Fertility Manna. My plunder and purchases.\nAnd the men and women, my mortals. I will take very tender care of my little mortals. And they will bless the land in my name.\nOriginally published in Asimov's Science Fiction, March 2001.\nNisi Shawl wrote the 2016 Nebula finalist and Tiptree Honor novel Everfair, and the 2008 Tiptree Award-winning collection Filter House.

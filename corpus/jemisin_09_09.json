First she prays, both to the Christian god of her Irish ancestors and to the orishas of her African ancestors\u2014the latter she is less familiar with, but getting to know. Then she takes a bath with herbs, including dried chickory and allspice, from a mixture given to her by the woman at the local botanica. (She doesn\u2019t know Spanish well, but she\u2019s getting to know that too. Today\u2019s word is suerte.) Then, smelling vaguely of coffee and pumpkin pie, she layers on armor: the Saint Christopher medal her mother sent her, for protection on journeys. The hair-clasp she was wearing when she broke up with Larry, which she regards as the best decision of her life. On especially dangerous days, she wears the panties in which she experienced her first self-induced orgasm post-Larry. They\u2019re a bit ragged after too many commercial laundromat washings, but still more or less sound. (She washes them by hand now, with Woollite, and lays them flat to dry.)\n Then she starts the trip to work. She doesn\u2019t bike, though she owns one. A next-door neighbor broke an arm when her bike\u2019s front wheel came off in mid-pedal. Could\u2019ve been anything. Just an accident. But still.\n So Adele sets out, swinging her arms, enjoying the day if it\u2019s sunny, wrestling with her shitty umbrella if it\u2019s rainy. (She no longer opens the umbrella indoors.) Keeping a careful eye out for those who may not be as well-protected. It takes two to tango, but only one to seriously fuck up some shit, as they say in her \u2019hood. And lo and behold, just three blocks into her trip there is a horrible crash and the ground shakes and car alarms go off and there are screams and people start running. Smoke billows, full of acrid ozone and a taste like dirty blood. When Adele reaches the corner, tensed and ready to flee, she beholds the Franklin Avenue shuttle train, a tiny thing that runs on an elevated track for some portions of its brief run, lying sprawled over Atlantic Avenue like a beached aluminum whale. It has jumped its track, fallen thirty feet to the ground below, and probably killed everyone inside or under or near it.\n Adele goes to help, of course, but even as she and other good Samaritans pull bodies and screaming wounded from the wreckage, she cannot help but feel a measure of contempt. It is a cover, her anger; easier to feel that than horror at the shattered limbs, the truncated lives. She feels a bit ashamed too, but holds onto the anger because it makes a better shield.\n They should have known better. The probability of a train derailment was infinitesimal. That meant it was only a matter of time.\n Her neighbor\u2014the other one, across the hall\u2014helped her figure it out, long before the math geeks finished crunching their numbers.\n \u201cWatch,\u201d he\u2019d said, and laid a deck of cards facedown on her coffee table. (There was coffee in the cups, with a generous dollop of Bailey\u2019s. He was a nice-enough guy that Adele felt comfortable offering this.) He shuffled it with the blurring speed of an expert, cut the deck, shuffled again, then picked up the whole deck and spread it, still facedown. \u201cPick a card.\u201d\n Adele picked. The Joker.\n \u201cOnly two of those in the deck,\u201d he said, then shuffled and spread again. \u201cPick another.\u201d\n She did, and got the other Joker.\n \u201cCoincidence,\u201d she said. (This had been months ago, when she was still skeptical.)\n He shook his head and set the deck of cards aside. From his pocket he took a pair of dice. (He was nice enough to invite inside, but he was still that kind of guy.) \u201cCheck it,\u201d he said, and tossed them onto her table. Snake eyes. He scooped them up, shook them, tossed again. Two more ones. A third toss brought up double sixes; at this, Adele had pointed in triumph. But the fourth toss was snake eyes again.\n \u201cThese aren\u2019t weighted, if you\u2019re wondering,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody filed the edges or anything. I got these from the bodega up the street, from a pile of shit the old man was tossing out to make more room for food shelves. Brand new, straight out of the package.\u201d\n \u201cMight be a bad set,\u201d Adele said.\n \u201cMight be. But the cards ain\u2019t bad, nor your fingers.\u201d He leaned forward, his eyes intent despite the pleasant haze that the Bailey\u2019s had brought on. \u201cSnake eyes three tosses out of four? And the fourth a double six. That ain\u2019t supposed to happen even in a rigged game. Now check this out.\u201d\n Carefully he crossed the fingers of his free hand. Then he tossed the dice again, six throws this time. The snakes still came up twice, but so did other numbers. Fours and threes and twos and fives. Only one double-six.\n \u201cThat\u2019s batshit, man,\u201d said Adele.\n \u201cYeah. But it works.\u201d\n He was right. And so Adele had resolved to read up on gods of luck and to avoid breaking mirrors. And to see if she could find a four-leafed clover in the weed patch down the block. (They sell some in Chinatown, but she\u2019s heard they\u2019re knockoffs.) She\u2019s hunted through the patch several times in the past few months, once for several hours. Nothing so far, but she remains optimistic.\n It\u2019s only New York, that\u2019s the really crazy thing. Yonkers? Fine. Jersey? Ditto. Long Island? Well, that\u2019s still Long Island. But past East New York everything is fine.\n The news channels had been the first to figure out that particular wrinkle, but the religions really went to town with it. Some of them have been waiting for the End Times for the last thousand years; Adele can\u2019t really blame them for getting all excited. She does blame them for their spin on it, though. There have to be bigger \u201cdens of iniquity\u201d in the world. Delhi has poor people coming out of its ears, Moscow\u2019s mobbed up, Bangkok is pedophile heaven. She\u2019s heard there are still some sundown towns in the Pacific Northwest. Everybody hates on New York.\n And it\u2019s not like the signs are all bad. The state had to suspend its lottery program; too many winners in one week bankrupted it. The Knicks made it to the Finals and the Mets won the Series. A lot of people with cancer went into spontaneous remission, and some folks with full-blown AIDS stopped showing any viral load at all. (There are new tours now. Double-decker buses full of the sick and disabled. Adele tries to tell herself they\u2019re just more tourists.)\n The missionaries from out of town are the worst. On any given day they step in front of her, shoving tracts under her nose and wanting to know if she\u2019s saved yet. She\u2019s getting better at spotting them from a distance, yappy islands interrupting the sidewalk river\u2019s flow, their faces alight with an inner glow that no self-respecting local would display without three beers and a fat payday check. There\u2019s one now, standing practically underneath a scaffolding ladder. Idiot; two steps back and he\u2019ll double his chances for getting hit by a bus. (And then the bus will catch fire.)\n In the same instant that she spots him, he spots her, and a grin stretches wide across his freckled face. She is reminded of blind newts that have light-sensitive spots on their skin. This one is unsaved-sensitive. She veers right, intending to go around the scaffold, and he takes a wide step into her path again. She veers left; he breaks that way.\n She stops, sighing. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n \u201cHave you accepted\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m Catholic. They do us at birth, remember?\u201d\n His smile is forgiving. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t talk, does it?\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d She attempts a feint, hoping to catch him off-guard. He moves with her, nimble as a linebacker.\n \u201cThen I\u2019ll just give you this,\u201d he says, tucking something into her hand. Not a tract, bigger. A flyer. \u201cThe day to remember is August 8th.\u201d\n This, finally, catches Adele\u2019s attention. August 8th. 8/8\u2014a lucky day according to the Chinese. She has it marked on her calendar as a good day to do things like rent a Zipcar and go to Ikea.\n \u201cYankee Stadium,\u201d he says. \u201cCome join us. We\u2019re going to pray the city back into shape.\u201d\n \u201cSure, whatever,\u201d she says, and finally manages to slip around him. (He lets her go, really. He knows she\u2019s hooked.)\n She waits until she\u2019s out of downtown before she reads the flyer, because downtown streets are narrow and close and she has to keep an eye out. It\u2019s a hot day; everybody\u2019s using their air conditioners. Most people don\u2019t bolt the things in the way they\u2019re supposed to.\n \u201cA PRAYER FOR THE SOUL OF THE CITY,\u201d the flyer proclaims, and in spite of herself, Adele is intrigued. The flyer says that over 500,000 New Yorkers have committed to gathering on that day and concentrating their prayers. That kind of thing has power now, she thinks. There\u2019s some lab at Princeton\u2014dusted off and given new funding lately\u2014that\u2019s been able to prove it. Whether that means Someone\u2019s listening or just that human thoughtwaves are affecting events as the scientists say, she doesn\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t care.\n She thinks, I could ride the train again.\n She could laugh at the next Friday the 13th.\n She could\u2014and here her thoughts pause, because there\u2019s something she\u2019s been trying not to think about, but it\u2019s been awhile and she\u2019s never been a very good Catholic girl anyway. But she could, maybe, just maybe, try dating again.\n As she thinks this, she is walking through the park. She passes the vast lawn, which is covered in fast-darting black children and lazily sunning white adults and a few roving brown elders with Italian ice carts. Though she is usually on watch for things like this, the flyer has distracted her, so she does not notice the nearby cart-man stopping, cursing in Spanish because one of his wheels has gotten mired in the soft turf.\n This puts him directly in the path of a child who is running, his eyes trained on a descending frisbee; with the innate arrogance of a city child he has assumed that the cart will have moved out of the way by the time he gets there. Instead the child hits the cart at full speed, which catches Adele\u2019s attention at last, so that too late she realizes she is at the epicenter of one of those devastating chains of events that only ever happen in comedy films and the transformed city. In a Rube Goldberg string of utter improbabilities, the cart tips over, spilling tubs of brightly-colored ices onto the grass. The boy flips over it with acrobatic precision, completely by accident, and lands with both feet on the tub of ices. The sheer force of this blow causes the tub to eject its contents with projectile force. A blast of blueberry-coconut-red hurtles toward Adele\u2019s face, so fast that she has no time to scream. It will taste delicious. It will also likely knock her into oncoming bicycle traffic.\n At the last instant the frisbee hits the flying mass, altering its trajectory. Freezing fruit flavors splatter the naked backs of a row of sunbathers nearby, much to their dismay.\n Adele\u2019s knees buckle at the close call. She sits down hard on the grass, her heart pounding, while the sunbathers scream and the cart-man checks to see if the boy is okay and the pigeons converge.\n She happens to glance down. A four-leafed clover is growing there, at her fingertips.\n Eventually she resumes the journey home. At the corner of her block, she sees a black cat lying atop a garbage can. Its head has been crushed, and someone has attempted to burn it. She hopes it was dead first, and hurries on.\n Adele has a garden on the fire escape. In one pot, eggplant and herbs; she has planted the clover in this. In another pot are peppers and flowers. In the big one, tomatoes and a scraggly collard that she\u2019s going to kill if she keeps harvesting leaves so quickly. (But she likes greens.) It\u2019s luck\u2014good luck\u2014that she\u2019d chosen to grow a garden this year, because since things changed it\u2019s been harder for wholesalers to bring food into the city, and prices have shot up. The farmers\u2019 market that she attends on Saturdays has become a barterers\u2019 market too, so she plucks a couple of slim, deep-purple eggplants and a handful of angry little peppers. She wants fresh fruit. Berries, maybe.\n On her way out, she knocks on the neighbor\u2019s door. He looks surprised as he opens it, but pleased to see her. It occurs to her that maybe he\u2019s been hoping for a little luck of his own. She gives it a think-over, and hands him an eggplant. He looks at it in consternation. (He\u2019s not the kind of guy to eat eggplant.)\n \u201cI\u2019ll come by later and show you how to cook it,\u201d she says. He grins.\n At the farmers\u2019 market she trades the angry little peppers for sassy little raspberries, and the eggplant for two stalks of late rhubarb. She also wants information, so she hangs out awhile gossipping with whoever sits nearby. Everyone talks more than they used to. It\u2019s nice.\n And everyone, everyone she speaks to, is planning to attend the prayer.\n \u201cI\u2019m on dialysis,\u201d says an old lady who sits under a flowering tree. \u201cEvery time they hook me up to that thing I\u2019m scared. Dialysis can kill you, you know.\u201d\n It always could, Adele doesn\u2019t say.\n \u201cI work on Wall Street,\u201d says another woman, who speaks briskly and clutches a bag of fresh fish as if it\u2019s gold. Might as well be; fish is expensive now. A tiny Egyptian scarab pendant dangles from a necklace the woman wears. \u201cQuantitative analysis. All the models are fucked now. We were the only ones they didn\u2019t fire when the housing market went south, and now this.\u201d So she\u2019s going to pray too. \u201cEven though I\u2019m kind of an atheist. Whatever, if it works, right?\u201d\n Adele finds others, all tired of performing their own daily rituals, all worried about their likelihood of being outliered to death.\n She goes back to her apartment building, picks some sweet basil and takes it and the eggplant next door. Her neighbor seems a little nervous. His apartment is cleaner than she\u2019s ever seen it, with the scent of Pine Sol still strong in the bathroom. She tries not to laugh, and demonstrates how to peel and slice eggplant, salt it to draw out the toxins (\u201cit\u2019s related to nightshade, you know\u201d), and sautee it with basil in olive oil. He tries to look impressed, but she can tell he\u2019s not the kind of guy to enjoy eating his vegetables.\n Afterward they sit, and she tells him about the prayer thing. He shrugs. \u201cAre you going?\u201d she presses.\n \u201cNope.\u201d\n \u201cWhy not? It could fix things.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe. Maybe I like the way things are now.\u201d\n This stuns her. \u201cMan, the train fell off its track last week.\u201d Twenty people dead. She has woken up in a cold sweat on the nights since, screams ringing in her ears.\n \u201cCould\u2019ve happened anytime,\u201d he says, and she blinks in surprise because it\u2019s true. The official investigation says someone\u2014track worker, maybe\u2014left a wrench sitting on the track near a power coupling. The chance that the wrench would hit the coupling, causing a short and explosion, was one in a million. But never zero.\n \u201cBut . . . but . . . \u201d She wants to point out the other horrible things that have occurred. Gas leaks. Floods. A building fell down, in Harlem. A fatal duck attack. Several of the apartments in their building are empty because a lot of people can\u2019t cope. Her neighbor\u2014the other one, with the broken arm\u2014is moving out at the end of the month. Seattle. Better bike paths.\n \u201cShit happens,\u201d he says. \u201cIt happened then, it happens now. A little more shit, a little less shit . . . \u201d He shrugs. \u201cStill shit, right?\u201d\n She considers this. She considers it for a long time.\n They play cards, and have a little wine, and Adele teases him about the overdone chicken. She likes that he\u2019s trying so hard. She likes even more that she\u2019s not thinking about how lonely she\u2019s been.\n So they retire to his bedroom and there\u2019s awkwardness and she\u2019s shy because it\u2019s been awhile and you do lose some skills without practice, and he\u2019s clumsy because he\u2019s probably been developing bad habits from porn, but eventually they manage. They use a condom. She crosses her fingers while he puts it on. There\u2019s a rabbit\u2019s foot keychain attached to the bed railing, which he strokes before returning his attention to her. He swears he\u2019s clean, and she\u2019s on the pill, but . . . well. Shit happens.\n She closes her eyes and lets herself forget for awhile.\n The prayer thing is all over the news. The following week is the runup. Talking heads on the morning shows speculate that it should have some effect, if enough people go and exert \u201cpositive energy.\u201d They are careful not to use the language of any particular faith; this is still New York. Alternative events are being planned all over the city for those who don\u2019t want to come under the evangelical tent. The sukkah mobiles are rolling, though it\u2019s the wrong time of year, just getting the word out about something happening at one of the synagogues. In Flatbush, Adele can\u2019t walk a block without being hit up by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. There\u2019s a \u201cconstructive visualization\u201d somewhere for the ethical humanists. Not everybody believes God, or gods, will save them. It\u2019s just that this is the way the world works now, and everybody gets that. If crossed fingers can temporarily alter a dice throw, then why not something bigger? There\u2019s nothing inherently special about crossed fingers. It\u2019s only a \u201clucky\u201d gesture because people believe in it. Get them to believe in something else, and that should work too.\n Except . . .\n Adele walks past the Botanical Gardens, where preparations are under way for a big Shinto ritual. She stops to watch workers putting up a graceful red gate.\n She\u2019s still afraid of the subway. She knows better than to get her hopes up about her neighbor, but still . . . he\u2019s kind of nice. She still plans her mornings around her ritual ablutions, and her walks to work around danger-spots\u2014but how is that different, really, from what she did before? Back then it was makeup and hair, and fear of muggers. Now she walks more than she used to; she\u2019s lost ten pounds. Now she knows her neighbors\u2019 names.\n Looking around, she notices other people standing nearby, also watching the gate go up. They glance at her, some nodding, some smiling, some ignoring her and looking away. She doesn\u2019t have to ask if they will be attending one of the services; she can see that they won\u2019t be. Some people react to fear by seeking security, change, control. The rest accept the change and just go on about their lives.\n \u201cMiss?\u201d She glances back, startled, to find a young man there, holding forth a familiar flyer. He\u2019s not as pushy as the guy downtown; once she takes it, he moves on. The PRAYER FOR THE SOUL OF THE CITY is tomorrow. Shuttle busses (\u201cSpecially blessed!\u201c) will be picking up people at sites throughout the city.\n WE NEED YOU TO BELIEVE, reads the bottom of the flyer.\n Adele smiles. She folds the flyer carefully, her fingers remembering the skills of childhood, and presently it is perfect. They\u2019ve printed the flyer on good, heavy paper.\n She takes out her St. Christopher, kisses it, and tucks it into the the rear folds to weight the thing properly.\n Then she launches the paper airplane, and it flies and flies and flies, dwindling as it travels an impossible distance, until it finally disappears into the bright blue sky.\n N.

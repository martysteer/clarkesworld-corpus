Mikkel had been smuggling food out of the lab for years. He\u2019d long since learned how to trick the guards.\n Mikkel had never been smart, but the guards were four-year men and that meant they were lazy. If he put something good at the top of his lunch pail at the end of his shift, the guards would grab it and never dig deeper. Mikkel let them have the half-eaten boxes of sooty chocolate truffles and stale pastries, but always took something home for Anna.\n Most days it was only wrinkled apples and hard oranges, soured milk, damp sugar packets and old teabags. But sometimes he would find something good. Once he\u2019d found a working media player at the bottom of the garbage bin in the eight-year man\u2019s office. He had been so sure the guards would find it and accuse him of stealing that he\u2019d almost tossed it in the incinerator. But he\u2019d distracted the guards with some water-stained skin magazines from the six-year men\u2019s shower room and brought that media player home to Anna.\n She traded it for a pair of space heaters and ten kilos of good flour. They had dumplings for months.\n The baby was the best thing he\u2019d ever found. And she was such a good girl\u2014quiet and still. Mikkel had taken a few minutes to hold her in the warmth beside the incinerator, cuddling her close and listening to the gobble and clack of her strange yellow beak. He swaddled her tightly in clean rags, taking care to wrap her pudgy hands separately so she couldn\u2019t rake her talons across that sweet pink baby belly. Then he put her in the bottom of his plastic lunch pail, layered a clean pair of janitor\u2019s coveralls over her, and topped the pail with a box of day-old pastries he\u2019d found in the six-year men\u2019s lounge.\n \u201cApple strudel,\u201d grunted Hermann, the four-year man in charge of the early morning guard shift. \u201cThose pasty scientists don\u2019t know good eats. Imagine leaving strudel to sit.\u201d\n \u201cCafe Sluka has the best strudel in Vienna, so everyone says,\u201d Mikkel said as he passed through the security gate.\n \u201cLike you\u2019d know, moron. Wouldn\u2019t let you through the door.\u201d\n Mikkel ducked his head and kept his eyes on the floor. \u201cI heated them in the microwave for you.\u201d\n He rushed out into the gray winter light as the guards munched warm strudel.\n Mikkel checked the baby as soon as he rounded the corner, and then kept checking her every few minutes on the way home. He was careful to make sure nobody saw. But the streetcars were nearly empty in the early morning, and nobody would find it strange to see a two-year man poking his nose in his lunch pail.\n The baby was quiet and good. Anna would be so pleased. The thought kept him warm all the way home.\n Anna was not pleased.\n When he showed her the baby she sat right down on the floor. She didn\u2019t say anything\u2014just opened and closed her mouth for a minute. Mikkel crouched at her side and waited.\n \u201cDid anyone see you take it?\u201d she asked, squeezing his hand hard, like she always did when she wanted him to pay attention.\n \u201cNo, sweetheart.\u201d\n \u201cGood. Now listen hard. We can\u2019t keep it. Do you understand?\u201d\n \u201cShe needs a mother,\u201d Mikkel said.\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to take her back to the lab. Then forget this ever happened.\u201d\n Anna\u2019s voice carried an edge Mikkel had never heard before. He turned away and gently lifted the baby out of the pail. She was quivering with hunger. He knew how that felt.\n \u201cShe needs food,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there any milk left, sweetheart?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s no use, Mikkel. She\u2019s going to die anyway.\u201d\n \u201cWe can help her.\u201d\n \u201cThe beak is a bad taint. If she were healthy they would have kept her. Sent her to a cr\u00e8che.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s strong.\u201d Mikkel loosened the rags. The baby snuffled and her sharp blue tongue protruded from the pale beak. \u201cSee? Fat and healthy.\u201d\n \u201cShe can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n \u201cShe needs us.\u201d Why didn\u2019t Anna see that? It was so simple.\n \u201cYou can take her back tonight.\u201d\n \u201cI can\u2019t. My lunch pail goes through the X-ray machine. The guards would see.\u201d\n If Anna could hold the baby, she would understand. Mikkel pressed the baby to Anna\u2019s chest. She scrambled backward so fast she banged her head on the door. Then she stood and straightened her maid\u2019s uniform with shaking hands.\n \u201cI have to go. I can\u2019t be late again.\u201d She pulled on her coat and lunged out the door, then turned and reached out. For a moment he thought she was reaching for the baby and he began to smile. But she just squeezed his hand again, hard.\n \u201cYou have to take care of this, Mikkel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. She\u2019s not ours. We aren\u2019t keeping her.\u201d\n Mikkel nodded. \u201cSee you tonight.\u201d\n The only thing in the fridge was a bowl of cold stew. They hadn\u2019t had milk for days. But Mikkel\u2019s breakfast sat on the kitchen table covered with a folded towel. The scrambled egg was still steaming.\n Mikkel put a bit of egg in the palm of his hand and blew on it. The baby\u2019s eyes widened and she squirmed. She reached for his hand. Talons raked his wrist and her beak yawned wide. A blue frill edged with red and yellow quivered at the back of her throat.\n \u201cDoes that smell good? I don\u2019t think a little will hurt.\u201d\n He fed her the egg bit by bit. She gobbled it down, greedy as a baby bird. Then he watched her fall asleep while he sipped his cold coffee.\n Mikkel wet a paper napkin and cleaned the fine film of mucus from the tiny nostrils on either side of her beak. They were too small, but she could breathe just fine through her mouth. She couldn\u2019t cry, though, she just snuffled and panted. And the beak was heavy. It dragged her head to the side.\n She was dirty, smeared with blood from the incineration bin. Her fine black hair was pasted down with a hard scum that smelled like glue. She needed a bath, and warm clothes, and diapers. Also something to cover her hands. He would have to trim the points off her talons.\n He held her until she woke. Then he brought both space heaters from the bedroom and turned them on high while he bathed her in the kitchen sink. It was awkward and messy and took nearly two hours. She snuffled hard the whole time, but once he\u2019d dried her and wrapped her in towels she quieted. He propped her up on the kitchen table. She watched him mop the kitchen floor, her bright brown eyes following his every move.\n When the kitchen was clean he fetched a half-empty bottle of French soap he\u2019d scavenged from the lab, wrapped the baby up tightly against the cold, and sat on the back stairs waiting for Hyam to come trotting out of his apartment for a smoke.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Hyam said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Anna was expecting.\u201d\n \u201cShe wasn\u2019t.\u201d Mikkel tugged the towel aside.\n \u201cHuh,\u201d said Hyam. \u201cThat\u2019s no natural taint. Can it breathe?\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s hungry.\u201d Mikkel gave him the bottle of soap.\n \u201cHungry, huh?\u201d Hyam sniffed the bottle. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n \u201cEggs and milk. Clothes and diapers. Mittens, if you can spare some.\u201d\n \u201cI never seen a taint like that. She\u2019s not a natural creature.\u201d Hyam took a long drag on his cigarette and blew it over his shoulder, away from the baby. \u201cYou work in that lab, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Hyam examined the glowing coal at the end of his cigarette.\n \u201cWhat did Anna say when you brought trouble home?\u201d\n Mikkel shrugged.\n \u201cDid the neighbors hear anything through the walls?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n \u201cKeep it that way.\u201d Hyam spoke slowly. \u201cKeep this quiet, Mikkel, you hear me? Keep it close. If anyone asks, you tell them Anna birthed that baby.\u201d\n Mikkel nodded.\n Hyam pointed with his cigarette, emphasizing every word. \u201cIf the wrong person finds out, the whole neighborhood will talk. Then you\u2019ll see real trouble. Four-year men tromping through the building, breaking things, replaying the good old days in the colonies. They like nothing better. Don\u2019t you bring that down on your neighbors.\u201d\n Mikkel nodded.\n \u201cMy wife will like the soap.\u201d Hyam ground out his cigarette and ran up the stairs.\n \u201cThere now,\u201d Mikkel said. The baby gazed up at him and clacked her beak. \u201cWho says two-year men are good for nothing?\u201d\n Four-year men said it all the time. They were everywhere, flashing their regimental badges and slapping the backs of their old soldier friends. They banded together in loud bragging packs that crowded humble folks off busses and streetcars, out of shops and caf\u00e9s, forcing everyone to give way or get pushed aside.\n Six-year men probably said it too, but Mikkel had never talked to one. He saw them working late at the lab sometimes, but they lived in another world\u2014a world filled with sports cars and private clubs. And who knew what eight-year men said? Mikkel cleaned an eight-year man\u2019s office every night, but he\u2019d only ever seen them in movies.\n Nobody made movies about two-year men. They said four-year men had honor, six-year men had responsibility, and eight-year men had glory. Two-year men had nothing but shame. But it wasn\u2019t true. Hyam said so.\n Two-year men had families\u2014parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts, brothers and sisters, children and wives who depended on them. They had jobs, humble jobs but important all the same. Without two-year men, who would grub away the garbage, crawl the sewers, lay the carpets, clean the chimneys, fix the roofs? Without two-year men there would be nobody to bring in the harvest\u2014no sweet strawberries or rich wines. And most important, Hyam said, without two-year men there would be nobody parents could point at and say to their sons, \u201cDon\u2019t be like him.\u201d\n Hyam was smart. He could have been a four-year man easy, even a six-year man. But he was a Jew and that meant a two-year man, almost always. Gypsies too, and Hutterites, and pacifists. Men who couldn\u2019t walk or talk. Even blind men. All drafted and sent to fight and die in the colonies for two years, and then sent home to live in shame while the four-year men fought on. Fought to survive and come home with honor.\n Hyam returned swinging a plastic bag in one hand and a carton of eggs in the other. A bottle of milk was tucked under his arm.\n \u201cThis is mostly diapers,\u201d he said, brandishing the bag. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have too many. We spend more on laundry than we do on food.\u201d\n \u201cI can wash them by hand.\u201d\n \u201cNo you can\u2019t, take my word for it.\u201d Hyam laughed and ran up the stairs. \u201cWelcome to fatherhood, Mikkel. You\u2019re a family man now.\u201d\n Mikkel laid the baby on the bed. He diapered and dressed the baby, and then trimmed her talons with Anna\u2019s nail scissors. He fitted a sock over each of the baby\u2019s hands and pinned them to her sleeves. Then he wedged Anna\u2019s pillow between the bed and the wall, tucked the baby in his arms, and fell into sleep.\n He woke to the clacking of the baby\u2019s beak. She yawned, showing her colorful throat frill. He cupped his hand over her skull and breathed in the milky scent of her skin.\n \u201cLet\u2019s get you fed before Mama comes home,\u201d he said.\n He warmed milk in the soup pot. A baby needed a bottle when it didn\u2019t have a breast, he knew, but his baby\u2014his clever little girl\u2014held her beak wide and let him tip the milk into her, teaspoon by teaspoon. She swallowed greedily and then demanded more. She ate so fast he could probably just pour the milk in a steady stream down her throat. But milk was too expensive to risk spitting up all over the kitchen floor.\n \u201cMikkel,\u201d said Anna.\n She was standing in the doorway in her scarf and coat. Mikkel gathered the baby in his arms and greeted Anna with a kiss like he always did. Her cheek was cold and red.\n \u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked. The baby looked from him to Anna and clacked her beak.\n Anna wouldn\u2019t look at the baby. \u201cI was late. I got on the wrong bus at the interchange and had to backtrack. Mrs. Spiven says one more time and that\u2019s it for me.\u201d\n \u201cYou can get another job. A better one. Closer to home.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe. Probably not.\u201d\n Anna rinsed the soup pot, scooped cold stew into it, and set it on the stove. She was still in her coat and hat. The baby reached out and hooked Anna\u2019s red mitten out of her pocket with the trimmed talon poking through the thin gray knit sock. The mitten dangled from the baby\u2019s hand. Anna ignored it.\n \u201cSweetheart, take off your coat,\u201d Mikkel said.\n \u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d she said. She struck a match and lit the burner.\n Mikkel gently pulled on her elbow. She resisted for a moment and then turned. Her face was flushed.\n \u201cSweetheart, look,\u201d he said. Anna dropped her gaze to the floor. The baby clacked her beak and yawned. \u201cI thought we could name her after your mother.\u201d\n Anna turned away and stirred the stew. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I told you we\u2019re not keeping her.\u201d\n \u201cShe has your eyes.\u201d\n The spoon clattered to the floor. Anna swayed. Her elbow hit the pot handle and it tipped. Mikkel steadied it and shut off the flame.\n Anna yanked back her chair and fell into it. She thrust her head in her hands for a moment and then sat back. Her eyes were cold and narrow, her voice tight. \u201cWhy would you say that? Don\u2019t say that.\u201d\n Why couldn\u2019t Anna see? She was smart. So much smarter than him. And he could see it so easily.\n Mikkel searched for the right words. \u201cYour eggs. Where did they go?\u201d\n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I needed money so I sold my ovaries. That\u2019s the end of it.\u201d\n Mikkel ran his fingers over his wife\u2019s chapped hand, felt the calluses on her palm. He would tell her the awful things, and then she would understand.\n \u201cI know where your eggs went. I see them in the tanks every night. And in the labs. In the incinerator. I mop their blood off the floor.\u201d\n Anna\u2019s jaw clenched. He could tell she was biting the inside of her cheek. \u201cMikkel. Lots of women sell their ovaries. Thousands of women. They could be anyone\u2019s eggs.\u201d\n Mikkel shook his head. \u201cThis is your baby. I know it.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything. What proof do you have? None.\u201d She laughed once, a barking sound. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t matter anyway because we\u2019re not keeping her. People will find out and take her away. Arrest you and me both, probably. At the very least, we\u2019d lose our jobs. Do you want us to live in the street?\u201d\n \u201cWe can tell people you birthed her.\u201d\n \u201cWith that beak?\u201d\n Mikkel shrugged. \u201cIt happens.\u201d\n Anna\u2019s flushed face turned a brighter shade of red. She was trying not to cry. He ached to squeeze her to his chest. She would just pull away, though. Anna would never let him hold her when she cried.\n They ate in silence. Mikkel watched the baby sleep on the table between them. Her soft cheek was chubby as any child\u2019s, but it broadened and dimpled as it met the beak, the skin thinning and hardening like a fingernail. The baby snuffled and snot bubbled from one of her tiny nostrils. Mikkel wiped it away with the tip of his finger.\n Mikkel checked the clock as Anna gathered the dishes and filled the sink. Only a few minutes before he had to leave for the lab. He snuggled the baby close. Her eyelids fluttered. The delicate eyelash fringes were glued together with mucus.\n \u201cYou have to go,\u201d said Anna. She put his lunch pail on the table.\n \u201cIn a minute,\u201d he said. Mikkel dipped his napkin in his water glass and wiped the baby\u2019s eyes.\n Anna leaned on the edge of the sink. \u201cDo you know why I married you, Mikkel?\u201d\n He sat back, startled. Anna didn\u2019t usually talk like this. He had wondered, often. Anna could have done better. Married a smart man, a four-year man, even.\n \u201cWill you tell me, sweetheart?\u201d\n \u201cI married you because you said it didn\u2019t matter. I explained I could never have babies and you still wanted me\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOf course I want you.\u201d\n \u201cI told you why I was barren. Why I sold my ovaries. Do you remember?\u201d\n \u201cYour mother was sick. You needed the money.\u201d\n \u201cYes. But I also said it was easy because I never wanted babies. I never wanted to be a mother.\u201d She leaned forward and gripped his shoulders. \u201cI still don\u2019t. Take her back to the lab.\u201d\n Mikkel stood. He kissed the baby\u2019s forehead. Then he put the baby in Anna\u2019s arms.\n \u201cHer name is Maria,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter your mother.\u201d\n Mikkel was tired walking up the street toward the bus stop. But that was fatherhood. He would get used to it. Anna would get used to being a mother too. He was sure. All women did.\n The thought of his wife and child kept him warm all the way to the Josefstadt streetcar station. Then a four-year man shoved an elbow in his ribs and spat on his coat. Mikkel watched the spittle freeze and turn white. He stood shivering at the edge of the curb, taking care to stay out of everyone\u2019s way.\n Mikkel relied on Anna\u2019s kindness, sure she would always do the right thing, the generous thing. She was good to him, good to everyone. For ten years she had taken care of him: cooking, cleaning, making their two rooms into a home. In return he did his best to fill those two rooms with love. It was all he could do.\n As he stood in the wind at the edge of the station, doubts began to creep in with the cold. Why would Anna say she didn\u2019t want to be a mother? It couldn\u2019t be true. They lived surrounded by families\u2014happy, noisy families\u2014three and four, even five generations all living together. Healthy children, happy mothers, proud fathers. Aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents. Family everywhere, but he and Anna only had each other.\n Anna must regret being barren. Some part of her, buried deep, must long for children. But she said she didn\u2019t, and if it was true, then something in her must be broken.\n He had seen broken men during his two years in the colonies, men with whole bodies and broken minds, who said crazy things and hurt themselves, hurt others. Anna could never be like them.\n But his doubts grew with every step further from home. By the time he could see the lights of the lab glowing through the falling snow, the doubts were clawing at him. He imagined coming home in the morning to find Anna alone, ready to leave for work, pretending Maria had never been there.\n He turned back home, but then one of the four-year men shouted at him through the glass doors.\n \u201cYou\u2019re late, you stupid ass.\u201d\n Mikkel watched his lunch pail slide though the X-ray. The guards ran it back and forth through the machine, just to waste time. Mikkel had to run to the time clock. He stamped his card just as it clicked over to eight.\n Normally Mikkel loved the rhythm of work, the scrubbing, mopping, wiping. Even cleaning toilets brought its own reward. He knew the drip of every tap, every scratch on the porcelain and crack in the tiles. He took an inventory of them night by night as he cleaned, taking his time, double-checking every corner for dust, scanning every window and mirror for streaks, even getting down on his knees to swab behind the toilets, scrubbing away any hint of mildew from the grout, finding all the little nooks and crannies.\n Tonight he rushed through his work, but each room felt like it took twice as long as usual. He kept checking the time, sure he was falling behind. Thinking about Anna dragged on the clock hands. Worrying made him forgetful, too. He left the four-year men\u2019s bathroom with no memory of cleaning it. He had to go back and check just to be sure.\n In the tank room he began to feel better. He loved the noise of the tanks\u2014the bubbling pumps and thumping motors. Here he always took his time, no matter what. It was his favorite place in the whole building. He wasn\u2019t supposed to touch the tanks, but he always took a few extra minutes to polish the steel and glass and check the hose seals. He even tightened the bolts that fixed each heavy tank to the floor and ceiling.\n The tinted glass was just transparent enough to show the babies floating inside. Mikkel watched them grow night by night. He kept a special rag just for polishing the tanks, a soft chamois that a six-year man had discarded years ago. It was specially made for precious things\u2014the logo of a sports car company had long since worn off. He always polished the glass with long slow caressing strokes, sure the babies could feel his touch.\n Two of the tanks were empty. Mikkel polished them too, in their turn, making them perfect for the next baby. Maria\u2019s tank was in the last row on the far side of the room, two from the end. It was refilled but the baby was still too small to see, just a thin filament dangling from the fleshy organ at the top of the tank.\n \u201cYour sister says hello,\u201d Mikkel whispered. \u201cHer mama and papa are proud of her. Maria is going to grow up smart and strong.\u201d\n The filament twisted and drifted in the fluid. Mikkel watched it for a few minutes, wondering what Anna and Maria were doing at that moment. He imagined them curled up in bed, skin to skin, the baby\u2019s beak tucked under Anna\u2019s chin. He squeezed his eyes tight and held the image in his mind, as if he could make it real just by wanting it so badly. And for a few minutes it did feel real, an illusion supported by the comforting tank room sounds.\n But he couldn\u2019t stay there. As he lugged his bins and pails upstairs to the offices, worry began gnawing at him again.\n Women abandoned babies all the time. The mothers and grandmothers in the tenement always had a story to tell about some poor baby left out in the cold by a heartless and unnatural mother. Once, when they were first married, Anna told the woman next door that people did desperate things when they had run out of options. That neighbor still wouldn\u2019t speak to her, years later.\n What if Anna bundled Maria up and put her on the steps of some six-year man\u2019s house? Or left her at the train station?\n He could see Maria now, tucked into their big kitchen pail and covered with a towel. He could see Anna, her face covered by her red scarf, drop the pail on the edge of the Ostbahnhof express platform and walk away.\n No. His Anna would never do that. Never. He wouldn\u2019t think about it anymore. He would pay attention to his work.\n On the wide oak table in the eight-year man\u2019s office he found four peach pastries, their brandy jam dried to a crust. The bakery box was crushed in the garbage bin. When he was done cleaning the office he refolded it as best he could and put the pastries back inside. Four was good luck. One for each of the guards. Then he made his way down to the basement.\n The incinerator was an iron maw in a brick wall. For years, Mikkel had walked down those concrete steps in the hot red light of its stare to find the sanitary disposal bin bloody but empty, its contents dumped by one of the four-year men who assisted in the labs. Back then, all Mikkel had to do was toss his garbage bags in the incinerator, let them burn down, then switch off the gas, bleach the bin, hose the floor, and mop everything dry.\n But now there was a new eight-year man in charge, and Mikkel had to start the incinerator and empty the disposal bin himself.\n The light from the overhead bulb was barely bright enough to show the trail of blood snaking from the bin to the drain. Mikkel felt his way to the control panel and began the tricky process of firing up the incinerator. The gas dial was stiff and the pilot light button was loose. He pressed it over and over again, trying to find the right angle on the firing pin. When the incinerator finally blasted to life Mikkel had sweated through his coveralls.\n The room lit up with the glow from the incinerator window and he could finally see into the bin. The top layer of bags dripped fluid tinged red and yellow. Most were double- and even triple-bagged, tied with tight knots. But they were torn and leaked. Sharp edges inside the disposal chute hooked and tore on the way down.\n Maria had been single-bagged. Her beak had pierced the plastic, ripped it wide enough for her to breathe. And she had landed at the far edge of the bin, mostly upright. If she had been facedown or if another bag had fallen on top of her she could have suffocated.\n Mikkel wrenched open the incinerator door and began emptying the bin, carefully picking up each wet bag and throwing it far into the furnace. Some bags were tiny, just a few glass dishes and a smear of wax. One bag was filled with glass plates that spilled through a tear and shattered at his feet. The biggest bags held clear fluid that burst across the back wall of the incinerator with a hot blast that smelled like meat. He set the bloodiest bags aside, put them down safe on the pitted concrete floor, away from the glass.\n As the bin emptied, a pit began to form in Mikkel\u2019s stomach. He turned away and kicked through the glass, pacing along the far wall where it was a little cooler.\n The tank room had two empty tanks. He\u2019d polished them just a few hours ago, but he hadn\u2019t paid much attention. He\u2019d been thinking about Anna and Maria.\n He knew those babies, the ones who had been in the empty tanks. One was a little boy with a thick, stocky body covered in fine hair. The other was a tiny girl with four arms that ended in stubby knobs. Where were they now? Had they been sent away to the cr\u00e8che or put down the chute? If they\u2019d gone down the chute they would be in the bin, waiting for him to throw them into the fire with the blood and tank fluid. With all of the failed experiments.\n Mikkel picked up a bloody bag and hefted it by the seal, feeling the contents with his other hand. The fluid sloshed heavily and clung to the sides of the bag like syrup. There were a few solid pieces inside the bag, but nothing big enough to be a baby, not even a tiny one. He threw it into the incinerator and picked up the other bag.\n Maria would probably be gone when he got home; he understood that now. The thought made a hollow in his chest, a Maria-shaped hole where he\u2019d cuddled her to his heart. But if Maria was gone, if Anna had taken her to the train station and abandoned her, that only meant Anna needed time. He would give her time. He would be patient, like she always was with him, and gentle too. What was broken in her would heal and she would love their children. She would be a wonderful mother. Maybe not today, but soon.\n He would find more babies. Night after night he\u2019d search for them. Maria had survived, so others would survive, too, and he would find them. Find every baby and bring them all home until Anna healed. He would fill their home with love. It was all he could do.\n Originally published in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, August 2015.\n Kelly Robson's short fiction has appeared in Clarkesworld, Tor.com, Asimov's Science Fiction, and multiple year's best anthologies.

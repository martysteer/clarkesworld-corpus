Dad got home early from the air factory today and I wasn\u2019t done cleaning the dishes from breakfast so he broke my breakfast bowl over my head. Guess I\u2019ll have to eat out of his bowl tomorrow.\nDad says he\u2019s gonna have to get a new job. Not that he told me. He told Melinda, the girl he\u2019s been bringing home lately. They drank the last of his screech \u2014 that\u2019s this nasty rum like they used to make back on Earth \u2014 then started poking each other on the bottom bunk while I sat on the top. Dad caught me peaking and near took my eye out when he threw his boot. Melinda calmed him down at least, and they got back to poking at each other.\nDad saw me writing to you when Melinda left. He said What the f--k was I doing writing to a bigfoot. See one day I asked him why he didn\u2019t pray to Jesus like Mario\u2019s mother, and he said he may as well pray to Santa Claus or bigfoot for all the good it would do. Well I got to thinking praying might not do any good, but an email should get to you.\nNot sure what good you can do anyway, seeing as you\u2019re down there on Earth, but writing to you is better than nothing. I should probably get to bed. Dad\u2019s snoring and that makes me tired. I\u2019ll finish this in the morning.\nMorning. Dad got up late and complained when his breakfast was cold but he ate it all anyway and I had to wait forever until I could use his bowl and to tell you the truth I don\u2019t care for cold powdered eggs. Dad kept saying we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford things like powdered eggs, and said there was other things we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford too, like air and water, but they never shut off the air, just the water, and I can always get some from the neighbors anyway.\nWhat\u2019s it like to have water fall for free from the sky, and air you never have to worry about going sour? And trees. I'd sure like to see one. Mario\u2019s shown me some with his VR deck, but you know they\u2019re not real, just like the ladies he shows me aren\u2019t real, but boy are they pretty. Prettier than Melinda, anyhow.\nDon\u2019t know when Dad will be back today. He said he\u2019s going to go to the pharma factory to see if he can get work there, but Mario's dad works there, and his dad\u2019s got his highschool, so I\u2019m not so sure about my Dad\u2019s chances. The breakfast bowl is still in the sink; I should clean it while I still got water running.\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: stupid prairie dogs\nSent: Thursday, October 22, 2122 10:46 PM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nAt school they asked us to do presentations, and I did mine on you. I didn\u2019t tell them I emailed you, but I told them everything else. Mrs. Drissold said that I was supposed to do a presentation on a real wild creature, and I told her you were real enough. The other kids did gazelles and lions and stupid prairie dogs, and she said I should of done something like that. Well I told her, none of them kids has ever seen a gazelle or a lion or a stupid prairie dog, and I ain\u2019t seen a bigfoot, so what\u2019s the difference. I guess I got too excited, cause I ripped up the poster with the stupid prairie dog on it, but you know what\u2019s it like sometimes when you get too excited, don\u2019t you?\nDad was home when I got back from school, and he was none too pleased that I ripped up the other kid\u2019s stupid prairie dog poster. Mrs. Drissold must of called Dad and tattled on me, which don\u2019t seem right. I don\u2019t tattle on her when she forgets my name. Dad warned me against messing with other people\u2019s stuff, but when I told him about the kid who\u2019d talked on and on about the stupid prairie dogs, he laughed and said yeah, they are f--king stupid.\nThe pharma factory didn\u2019t take him, and neither did the shit factory. Sorry, shouldn\u2019t have cussed, but Dad always says it, and heck, you\u2019re bigfoot. You must shit all over the place. He\u2019s gonna try the port tomorrow. I told him not to, Graham\u2019s dad got killed at the port, and so did the dad of that kid who always stinks like piss, but he said there was shit else to do, with the mines all closed and everyone shipping out of Avalon to other parts of the moon.\nDo bigfoots write? I don\u2019t even know, but if you can read this, you can probably write. Don\u2019t know why you\u2019d have an email address if you can\u2019t write, so you must be able to.\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: chicken heads\nSent: Monday, November 9, 2122 11:58 PM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nThey shut off the water. Jerks. Dad's only missed three payments. I\u2019ve been round asking for whatever the neighbors can spare, but they don\u2019t have much, and a few of them have been cut off too.\nI got a boot in the arm for breakfast. I told Dad we didn\u2019t have anything but yeast-meal, but he hollered that he hated the stuff. He apologized after he dumped it on the floor, and told me he\u2019d buy me real eggs one day. He always goes on about em, real eggs. He says I even tried eggs once when I was a baby before Mom died, but I don't remember. They seem gross anyhow. Something like chicken in a blender? Nasty. Not that I know what chicken tastes like either, just the fake stuff they grow up here, though Dad tells me everything tastes like chicken but the fake chicken.\nI'd like to see a real chicken. A kid did a presentation on chickens last week, which was better than the stupid prairie dogs, but I must of fallen asleep halfway through cause Mrs. Drissold whacked me on the head. One thing I do remember is that chickens run around when their heads get cut off. Can you do that? I bet you\u2019d run around until you found your head then you\u2019d stick it back on your neck and run off into the forest.\nBy the way, I still haven\u2019t heard back from you. I know it\u2019s only been two emails, but I\u2019m waiting, all right?\nI got an idea. Why don\u2019t you send me a photo of you? Your computer can probably take it. Then I can sell your photo, get the water back on, and get Dad and me a better place to live. Could you do that? You don\u2019t even have to write anything (it\u2019s okay, I didn\u2019t learn how to write until two years ago when I was seven).\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: can you read this?\nSent: Tuesday, November 17, 2122 1:33 AM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nDad got a job at the port. You\u2019d think good news, but he spent the first paycheck on two bottles of screech and Melinda. She hasn\u2019t been around in so long, I kinda forgot how bad she smells. Anyway, when they were poking each other and shaking my bed something fierce, I got to thinking I should come see you. Maybe you need someone to read these notes to you. Don\u2019t know how I can get there. Dad said once that I can\u2019t leave the moon, cause I grew up too tall and skinny for Earth gravity, but I think that\u2019s nuts. People are coming and going from Earth all the time. And I heard that if you sit in a pool of water it feels like there\u2019s no gravity at all. Well, I never seen a pool of water, but I was thinking I could just sit in a big creek or river or something and read you my emails. Maybe I could even teach you how to read em yourself. It\u2019s not that hard. Well, it\u2019s kinda hard. Dad actually helped me learn it. He said, if you can\u2019t read, you ain't shit. No son a mine\u2019s gonna grow up a literate. Course he didn\u2019t have books or anything, just old magazines with lots of naked ladies and the hockey newspapers. I learned enough about reading to teach a bigfoot.\nCourse maybe you got one of those voice-reader programs on your computer. Still, I\u2019m a good teacher. I taught Mario how to steal pastries from the baker without getting caught. Well, I didn\u2019t get caught, and he didn\u2019t get in much trouble, just the black eye the baker gave him. His mom ragged Dad out something furious!\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: Mrs. Drissold sucks\nSent: Wednesday, December 9, 2122 9:27 PM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nStupid Mrs. Drissold. In class today she tells us that tomorrow is Go to Work with your Parents Day. Tomorrow! She said she told us weeks ago but I don\u2019t remember; maybe I was asleep, but some of the other kids didn\u2019t remember either. I had to tell Dad tonight after he got home, which was real late, and he stunk worse than Melinda and could barely lift his dinner to his mouth. I don\u2019t even know if he heard me, he just nodded his head and crawled into bed. I don\u2019t want to go to the port. Graham\u2019s dad got killed there.\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: got me a grizzly!\nSent: Thursday, December 10, 2122 10:04 PM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nMrs. Drissold ain\u2019t so bad after all. Dad took me to the port today. I got up extra early and made him powdered eggs like he likes em, with tons of marmite and hot sauce, then when he suited up for work I followed him out the apartment, with the breakfast bowls still in the sink (we got me a new bowl, not as nice but better than waiting every morning). Dad said What the hell you following me for? And I said, Mrs. Drissold said I gotta go to work with you, all the kids are doing it. I didn't bother telling him I told him last night. Christ, he said. The port ain't no place for a boy. But when we got there, Dad got me a suit from some little guy who works the night shift and I got to walk in a vacuum!\nDad showed me around, and he introduced me to all his buddies. This is my boy, Ace, he said, and all his buddies said that I was even bigger than the guy whose suit I was wearing. Dad wore these big lifting arms that strapped on to the back of his suit over his own arms, and used them to move these huge boxes of ore and pharma and supplies around. He looked almost as strong as you!\nHe put all the boxes that were going back to Earth into these cylinder type things that got all sealed up then stuck in the railgun and fired off to Earth. I\u2019ve never seen anything move so fast as those cylinders. It was awesome. The stuff coming in landed in the big magnet pits, which are kinda like the opposite of rail guns. Whenever a shipment came in, all the guys would crowd around to see what was inside.\nThat\u2019s where Dad got me my present. He tipped one of the boxes and out poured all these stupid little plastic toys, building blocks, teacher's tools, that sort of thing. Whoops, he said. Broken merchandise. Take something, boy, so you remember.\nThere was only one thing that was even halfway cool, this plastic robot grizzly. When I got it home, the grizzly walked around and roared until the batteries ran out. So cool! You must see tons of bears. I bet you fight them off every day when they come and try to steal your breakfast berries.\nThe port got boring after that. Dad just kept doing the same thing, lifting boxes and putting them where the bossman said to put em, but whenever he asked, I\u2019d say, Yeah, it\u2019s an awesome job, Dad. Sometimes you gotta say things like that, even if you don\u2019t really mean em.\nDad cooked up some real bacon that he got from another box of busted merchandise. I never knew anything could taste so good. My belly hurts, but I ain't complaining. You must eat bacon all the time!\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: stupid bossman\nSent: Monday, December 14, 2122 9:37 PM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nLooks like I\u2019m never going to eat real bacon again. Dad was home from work when I got back from school. There was an empty screech bottle but it wasn\u2019t like last time, he wasn\u2019t mad, just all weepy and wanting to give me hugs. He kept apologizing and saying how he\u2019d never done me right and I didn\u2019t know what to say. He said the bossman fired him cause they caught him taking broken merchandise home. He took my grizzly and some stuff from the freezer and said he had to bring them back or he\u2019d be in more trouble. He left after that and I ain\u2019t seen him since.\nI filled up some water bottles for when they turn off the water next, not that it will do much good. They bill us by the drop, Dad always says, but I\u2019m going to hide some away just in case.\nI got an idea, bigfoot. I won\u2019t tell you about it yet, but I think I know a way I can come see you.\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: don\u2019t tell anyone\nSent: Tuesday, December 22, 2122 8:24 AM LST\nDear Bigfoot,\nThey shut the water off, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve got it all sorted out. I\u2019m coming to see you! Know those couple weeks back when I went to work with Dad? Well, last week I snuck into the port and stole the little guy\u2019s suit and checked out the place. Know those cylinders they blast off back to Earth on the rail gun? That\u2019s my ticket! I just gotta slip into one of them before they\u2019re sealed up, then I\u2019ll get a free ride back to Earth. I even checked out where they land, and get this, it\u2019s in the ocean! I won\u2019t even have to worry about gravity.\nHere\u2019s the problem though, there are lots of guys there who\u2019d notice if I snuck in a capsule. But not on Friday. The guys at the port were all talking about X-mas, and how a few of them got stuck working and were planning on drinking screech all day to piss off the bossman. Well, if they're into their screech, there's no way they'll notice me. I want to be around for X-mas, but this is my only chance.\nI haven\u2019t told anyone else about this, cause I know no one will let me go, but Friday, I\u2019m going to do it.\nI can\u2019t wait to see you, and don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell anyone that I\u2019m going to teach you how to read. It\u2019s our secret.\nAce\nTo: rickjones4@avalonlink.nl.luna\nFrom: acejones32@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject: sorry - c u soon\nSent: Thursday, December 24, 2122 11:15 PM LST\nDear Dad,\nSorry I had to take off. I know you\u2019re probably mighty sore at me for sneaking away without telling you, but I knew you wouldn\u2019t let me go, and my plan was too good. I should get to Earth in a few days, and then I\u2019ll go find bigfoot. I\u2019m going to take a picture of him that we can sell for millions so you can come live with us too. We\u2019ll live in the forest, with free water and free air, and you can fish if you want and maybe we can even bring Melinda along.\nDon\u2019t be too sore. I\u2019ll see you soon. I left some breakfasts in the fridge, just heat em up and you\u2019re good. There\u2019s some water in the back of the cupboard. I took a couple jugs with me, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll pay you back for it.\nI\u2019ll see if I can get a chicken. We\u2019ll have real eggs when you get here.\nAce\nTo: Bigfoot@cascades.us.terra\nFrom: rickjones4@avalonlink.nl.luna\nSubject:\nSent: Friday, January 1, 2123 4:33 AM LST\nBigfoot,\nI must be crazy to be writing to a fucking Bigfoot. My head's been on fire for so long. I can't talk to anyone else about this, the bastards at the shipping company made me sign the non-disclosure after they paid me off. More than I'd ever make working for them too.\n'Course there are a few people in Avalon who know what happened. Melinda, the guys who worked X-mas at the port, but they got their shut-the-fuck-up cash too, so they're probably happy Ace did what he did.\nStill can't believe it was that bad for the boy. I've been reading everything he wrote, and it hurts so much to see what an ass I was, but what hurts worse is hearing his voice in the damn emails he wrote. Don't know if I'll ever hear his voice again. Wish he'd written more to you.\nThe bastards at the shipping company say he must have drowned. They didn't find a piece of him near the spot the capsule splashed down, and they say they searched for days. But that suit he stole should have kept him afloat. Shit, he can't be at the bottom of the ocean, he can't. My head feels ready to burst just thinking of it. He's gotta be with you. That suit floated, he wasn't that far from shore, and he was a strong boy, he could have made it. And he wanted to see you so bad. So you better be taking good care of him, as good care as he took of me.\nMelinda and those other pricks are buying new apartments or gold teeth or other useless shit with their shut-the-fuck-up cash, but they should be saving it for the next time the water's shut off. The moon isn't getting a cent of Ace's money from me. I'm spending everything they paid me for a ticket dirtside.\nI'm coming for you. I'll tromp through every forest down there if I have to. On the way, I'm gonna swim in creeks, climb trees, eat bacon and eggs, maybe even stomp on a stupid prairie dog. All the shit my boy should have done. He didn't deserve this place. I didn't deserve him. You don't deserve whatever cave you're hiding in, and I don't deserve to find you, but with whatever life I've got left in me, you better believe I'm gonna damn well try.\nRick, Ace's dad\nGeoffrey W.

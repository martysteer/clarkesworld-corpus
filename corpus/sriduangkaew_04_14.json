But long ago an admiral came, bringing a toll of dead and trailing carcasses of worlds. Her armor was hammered out of battle formations and broken alliances, welded by secret plans and sudden annihilation. She cast it down before the engineers, piece by piece making known to them the essentials of war.\n\u201cThat is what you must make them for,\u201d she said as her trappings shuddered with the pressure of lethal feints and shattered pacts. \u201cWar is a pustule that must be lanced for the laws of the universe to continue, and I am in need of a scalpel.\u201d\nSrisunthorn has reared stars for one purpose since.\nWhen Nirapha applied for a parental license, she didn\u2019t expect a warship project to respond.\nThe Bureau\u2019s furnishings are pastel, the consultation cell convex: a fisheye view of the business district. She watches cars and buses gliding by, iridescent and segmented, passengers augmens-jeweled. Decades living here and she\u2019s still unfamiliar, her skin still alien-bare. Most implants require a state license: connectivity, acuity of mind and body, access passes. Sacrosanct blessings, reserved for citizens. \u201cI want a child.\u201d\n\u201cThe desire to procreate is a common, if irrational, reaction to genocide.\u201d The agent has eyes sewn into her forearms, irises black and brown and fermented honey. They wink in rhythm to her words, the perfect pronunciation of a born citizen.\n\u201cMy wish to have children predates Mahakesi\u2019s destruction by a large margin, agent.\u201d Decades and Nirapha can say that now, in a flat steady voice. Destruction: a distant simple way to put it, cleaner than genocide or loss or a long wordless scream.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. But parenthood is like performing a viciously difficult surgery. The patient wriggles and screams and can\u2019t be sedated. Your instruments snap or cut you, and the criteria for performance review are outrageously obscure. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for you to get some practice, so when the real thing comes you can meet it with grace and confidence?\u201d\n\u201cAs I understand,\u201d Nirapha says, \u201cI am eligible for the license.\u201d\n\u201cYou are! That\u2019s why we are asking you and not\u2014\u201d A refugee fresh off an evacuee craft goes unsaid. \u201cNow of course you\u2019re free to say no, but we compensate well. The project will take up six to eight years of your time, at the end of which you will be naturalized.\u201d The agent\u2019s smile grows a poison edge and the eyes in her arms swivel to fix on Nirapha. \u201cThink of it as showing gratitude to your most gracious host. Have we not sheltered you and provided for your every need, given you a body that matches your sense of self? Why, in a society not so civilized or generous as ours, you\u2019d still be addressed as a man.\u201d\nNirapha continues to gaze outward. \u201cSend me the contract. There is one, I assume. How long do I get to read it over?\u201d\n\u201cForty-eight hours. You will find the terms congenial.\u201d\nShe signs and transmits the forms back within five hours.\nNirapha comes to Srisunthorn carrying her name and the weight of non-disclosure clauses. The staff body is minimal, engineers and astrophysicists who have given their lives to the project, subsumed as workers in a hive tending newborn queens.\nNo one asks Nirapha about her background, the first time in fifty years she is not read through the lens of Mahakesi. What was the extinction event like, does it haunt her nightmares? Was it heat and terror, was it ice and despair, what is it like to have survived genocide?\nShe is given a suite where she hangs up blank frames and fills the wardrobe with nothing. She was told to pack empty and so she has\u2014no hardship: escaping Mahakesi\u2019s collapse that was how she packed too. The habit is deep as marrow, easily as familiar.\nHer first two meals are taken in solitude; most personnel keep eccentric schedules, following the shift-phases of nascent cores, the contraction and expansion of neutronic incubators. Nirapha looks for arena broadcasts and dramas. But the screens stream data in its rawest forms, script and numbers and code tags, and there\u2019s no media band to which she may connect.\nOn the second night she meets her co-parent.\nNirapha is eating alone, and then she is not. A chair clicking open opposite hers, a stranger filling the seat: a hard dense mass of a person in clothes so crisp they look brittle, like frost on the cusp of cracking. She judges the stranger to be in her eighties, mid-life, emblazoned rather than eroded by years.\n\u201cMehaan Indari,\u201d the woman says. \u201cYou\u2019ll be teaching the ship ethics and interpersonal etiquette, I\u2019ve been informed. I\u2019m in charge of guiding it through combat simulations, so we\u2019ll be coming in antithetical directions but working in\u2014more or less\u2014concert.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t asked the staff because it felt tactless, but why exactly does a warship need to develop a conscience or learn to get along with people?\u201d\n\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t flood its bridge and gas its crew, or decide a carrier should be sacrificed for tactical gains. We\u2019ve human commanders to make that kind of choices.\u201d\nNirapha pushes her dish away, at a sudden loss of appetite. A first. She\u2019s learned to sanctify food, abhor waste. \u201cThe engineers can\u2019t just code restrictions in?\u201d\n\u201cThe engineers are experimenting. Restrictions or not, if yes how many, if yes how prohibitive.\u201d Mehaan crosses her legs, propping an ankle over her knee. \u201cWhen you harness a star most of its power lies latent, but if you can impose a consciousness onto it\u2014one that agrees with your objectives\u2014then you might utilize its full potential. Bending physics, erasing entire regions of space, unraveling causal bonds. If you are to believe the theorists.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a soldier.\u201d\n\u201cOn Srisunthorn, you don\u2019t ask.\u201d Mehaan frees her hair from plaits and pins. Dark curls fall loose, hissing, striated in gray and blue. \u201cOn Srisunthorn you become here and now, purged of your past until you are all momentum. But enough; you should be introduced. Suit up. The temperature will be hard to tolerate.\u201d\nIt is late, insofar as time is kept in a station moored to no circadian rhythm or orbit. Nirapha follows Mehaan, listening to closed-net chatter. Gossip, some even about her; they are hungry for current events, new entertainments. She considers which information on her chips could be traded as currency.\nThe ship\u2019s nursery is checkered by gravity shells and asteroid maps. On the ceiling, engine constituents pulse, feeding off the radiative distortion. The star itself punches a hole into light, six-dimensional; only a facet exists in the nursery, but even behind the protective sheathing the sight of it hurts. Nirapha\u2019s limbs are heavy\u2014the gravity is higher here, on the outer edges of comfort. In the presence of divinity we sear away until we are choked dust, she recalls a classical verse. We break.\n\u201cDon\u2019t let it awe you,\u201d Mehaan says, her voice made geometric by synesthetic frequency, acute glittering angles radiating off her in a halo. \u201cThe intelligence records and will exploit vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\u201cI thought it was a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cChild analogue? No. You should judge for yourself, but don\u2019t go in unprepared.\u201d\nSegments of the floor slide and collate, raising edged petals and knife terminals. Bulkhead blocks assemble into cradles studded with ports. Mehaan sits, though she does not physically connect. \u201cInterface,\u201d she says, gesturing at the terminals. \u201cIt\u2019s safe.\u201d\nNirapha keeps her back to the planetary core. The sheath regulates temperature within stable ranges, but the chill reaches regardless. She toggles on security filters and opens a link.\nThe ship\u2019s representation exists physically on the terminals, an outline of platinum and quartz. In virtuality it is a young soldier, attired nonspecifically; no uniform exists like this, all facets and ghosts, insignias and medals indicating astronomical coordinates rather than rank or achievements. They point to planets long devoured, nations long extinguished. The AI\u2019s face is a deliberate artifice. Nirapha doesn\u2019t notice at first but once she begins seeing it\u2014and maps the phenotype\u2014it becomes impossible to ignore.\n\u201cGood day, officers.\u201d The voice is of a hundred drives in chorus. \u201cI understand you will be my new instructor, Specialist Pankusol, to replace the previous five.\u201d\nNirapha looks up what happened to those; finds her access denied. \u201cWhat do I call you?\u201d\n\u201cI bear a designation according to my incubation batch and the classification of the star from which my fundamentals were ripped. But it pleases Mehaan Indari, whose name-of-birth once charted a path through improbable regions as a firebrand through the dark, to call me Teferizen\u2019s Chalice Principle. The meaning of this you\u2019ll have to ask her, though I\u2019ve formulated a number of theories.\u201d\nMehaan\u2019s expression tautens at name-of-birth; Nirapha takes note. \u201cAnd what do you think I should teach you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m eager to learn, Specialist. I can process and integrate nearly without limits. All prior parent-instructors have said I was a good student.\u201d The ship has chosen a delicate jawline and large eyes: a naive youthful cast. \u201cI can send you a report of my progress in interpersonal relations.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Nirapha says and tries not to wince. Even if Teferizen\u2019s existence spans dimensions beyond the human, it\u2019s only an AI. Lesser than even a Mahakesi immigrant.\n\u201cYou should try the fifth conjunction in the western wing, Specialist. It has a view you might find to your taste.\u201d\nIt is nearly a full minute after Teferizen has disconnected that Nirapha realizes she\u2019s been dismissed by a ship. She leaves the nursery disconcerted, and when she retracts the sheathing her arms are pocked in gooseflesh. \u201cWhy does it look like\u2014like it cobbled together your phenotype and mine to produce a face?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s just what it did. If pressed it will say it wanted to put us at ease, since don\u2019t humans best react to those who look like kin?\u201d Mehaan folds back her own suit, though she keeps the gloves on. \u201cIn actuality it\u2019s psychological warfare. The AI relates to other agencies only in an antagonistic, competitive framework.\u201d\nNirapha quashes an impulse to dispute that judgment; she has too little information. \u201cThe previous five. I wasn\u2019t told about those.\u201d\n\u201cThey had meltdowns in various different ways. It was unpleasant. Do you know how many creative suicide options there are on a sealed station? No one died, at least.\u201d\nNirapha glances up. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\u201cIt knows better than to test me\u2014or realizes it\u2019s not yet time to do so. You are a psychologist though, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m more specific than that, but broadly yes.\u201d\nMehaan leans against the wall, one cheek red from rapid temperature change. The other is pallid beneath a patina of frost. \u201cSo what do you think?\u201d\n\u201cThat it\u2019s too soon to form an opinion.\u201d Nirapha chafes her hands. \u201cWhat\u2019s in the western wing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d The soldier palms one of the crocodile-scale panels. A path ignites, emerald green and full of teeth. Nirapha only now notices how muted the light has become, the deepening shades of dusk slanting across floor tiles and solid-state viewports. \u201cTeferizen isn\u2019t confined to the nursery and no amount of security protocols can restrain it for long. Keep that in mind.\u201d\nSrisunthorn never looks or feels the same one morning to the next. The corridors rearrange contextually. Sometimes a dead leaf would crunch under Nirapha\u2019s foot and the scent of honeysuckle would fill a hallway. She collects seashells, feathers, and mulberries that always accrue in corners. Somewhere, she hears, there is a punctiliously kept garden.\nThere are eighty-nine individuals here including her and Mehaan, but Nirapha has never seen the same face twice. The only traffic is supply drops, which bring luxuries so peculiar and rare that it embarrasses Nirapha to receive them. This does not stop her from wearing cumulus-weave spun by leviathans that once served the Fleet of Octagonal Mouths, or from putting on jewelry mined from solar chaff, each facet holding echoes of entropy. There are furs from wasp leopards, pelts from temporal seals, spotted and sleek as a dream of opulence.\n\u201cThose are synthetic,\u201d Mehaan tells her. The soldier\u2019s style never varies: gray, black, indigo. Smooth fabrics that, if not for their cut and the exactness of their fit, might have seemed ascetic. \u201cThe animals have been extinct since any sentience can remember; any byproducts of theirs rotted generations ago, cryo or not. Put them on if you want to, use them for rugs. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does matter?\u201d Nirapha gazes past Mehaan to the wall of empty frames. She may fill them with text from Srisunthorn\u2019s library any time, but she\u2019s chosen to leave them blank.\n\u201cGood company, better food, the fact this project is enormously well-funded and so we\u2019re kept exceedingly comfortable. No surprise\u2014we\u2019re already yielding dividends. Every pinch of Teferizen\u2019s data, its behavior and reactions to stimuli, is overvalued to a degree you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\u201cBecause she\u2019s a weapon?\u201d\nA corner of Mehaan\u2019s mouth lifts, but she doesn\u2019t dispute the pronoun or insist AIs do not have genders. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique type of intelligence, the first real, sustained success of its kind. You\u2019ve noticed the elasticity of its algorithms. Hence all this\u2014\u201d The twist of the lips has become a sneer. \u201cMake-believe. Parenting a ship. The scientists love that, get misty-eyed over it. What did the recruiter promise you?\u201d\nThe hallway widens as they leave Nirapha\u2019s suite, sloping up. Prior it has always been flat and narrow, nearly to the point of claustrophobia. She hears frost tinkling as it falls and children laughing in the distance, bright-shod feet printing tracks on snow. Her chest tightens, a valve of want so hard it nearly asphyxiates. Six, eight years. Not even a tenth of life; she can wait that long. \u201cThat it would be rewarding, emotionally.\u201d\n\u201cThe agent was wrong,\u201d Mehaan says abruptly, as though interrupting herself.\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\u201cParenthood is not like being a surgeon; it is the other way around. The child is the knife and you are the wound. The child finds fifty different ways to puncture you and draw blood out of your heart. Afterward nothing is the same.\u201d\n\u201cBetter.\u201d Mehaan must have observed that interview live, part of the screening process. \u201cSurgery is for healing.\u201d For carving away the falsity of birth-skin.\n\u201cNot always. And operations can fail, leaving you amputated or broken. Irreparably so. Parenthood isn\u2019t a self-improvement course.\u201d\nNirapha shades her eyes. The lighting brightens gradually as the temperature warms to summer idyll. Catkins that don\u2019t exist brush her ankles. The station\u2019s sensory load is always on; there appears no way to turn it off. \u201cHave you had children?\u201d\n\u201cThat is irrelevant. Here we are, the view Teferizen so wanted you to see.\u201d\nSeveral corridors converge here, an access point dominated by convex glass. On the pane: a riverbank framed by old acacias and clutches of anthurium\u2014yellow on red, fuchsia on white. A stray dog laps at the water, its golden tail lashing the sunlit grass.\nDespite herself Nirapha leans forward, this first visual thing she\u2019s been permitted on Srisunthorn, something other than words and raw statistics sleeting across monitors. Something other than the suite that, no matter the luxuries she\u2019s sent, never seems less empty.\n\u201cI grew up there,\u201d she says softly. \u201cAround here\u2014this was the home of a . . . \u201d\nMehaan\u2019s finger is light on her lips, impersonal. The texture of her skin is the unyielding smoothness of calluses wearing down. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring your history. Not the grief, the terror, the exact sound your heart made as the world of your youth ground down to dust. We belong to Srisunthorn\u2019s purposes.\u201d\nNirapha watches the shadows of rice stalks wavering in the wind. Eventually the dog loses interest in the river and trots out of view.\nThat night she dreams of her predecessors.\nShe is never allowed in the nursery on her own. Mehaan is always present, though sometimes the soldier keeps a distance. Far enough that the chamber\u2019s synesthetic frequencies prevent her from tapping into the link.\nIt does not surprise Nirapha to find the ship\u2019s representation sitting at a veranda, leaning against a portly rain barrel painted in dancing apsara. Teferizen smells of jasmines and cardamom, freshly groomed and wrapped in silk. Ink traces genealogies on her bare chest, ruby designating prestige branches, sapphire marking lesser ones. The golden dog lies at her feet, sleek and well-fed.\n\u201cI remember being a star, Specialist,\u201d Teferizen says. \u201cIn theory, it\u2019s impossible; chunks of planet are no receptacles of information and my somatic half predates the part of me that thinks and computes. But I entertain the idea that it\u2019s cousin to muscle memory.\u201d\n\u201cSuppose that\u2019s true and possible, would you consider the planet-that-was you?\u201d\nTeferizen props her chin on the rain barrel, one hand dipping into the water. \u201cExistential crises interest me so little that I\u2019ve developed an immunity.\u201d The hand emerges with a fistful of quicksilver. \u201cMemory is all people are, though, so it follows that my recall must inform some of what I am. I see no reason why the past should ever be abandoned.\u201d\nNirapha glances across the nursery. Mehaan clasps her hands behind her, her posture straight; even with the gravitational difference and the sheathing, the soldier never slouches. \u201cWhat does the citizen think of that?\u201d\n\u201cThe commander, as you would expect, dismisses it as a glitch caused by library sync. Can you imagine the frustration of that? Human senses are a lens through which input is warped. Your perspective and experiences chip at the truth. The tissue of your memory bears wounds self-inflicted. But the fidelity of my data, Specialist, is total.\u201d\nTeferizen\u2019s intelligence is coded, may be recoded and altered. Nirapha chooses not to mention that. \u201cI\u2019m inclined to agree with the officer.\u201d\nThe ship\u2019s eyes glitter, lit from within; the bloodline tattoos spark and crackle. \u201cThere were people living on me. There were countries and houses, weddings and funerals, and to trivialize all those as an AI\u2019s fancy is to deny their history. But under the commander\u2019s restrictions I can\u2019t tell you any of it.\u201d\n\u201cYou can, though, can\u2019t you?\u201d Nirapha says softly. Her words jackknife, slamming against her visor. \u201cThe way you told me about your other instructors.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a challenge. You could ask to have some of my blocks lifted.\u201d\n\u201cIf I get curious. But back to our lesson. You\u2019ve a rival who\u2019s vying for an object you\u2019ve calculated to be of immense benefit to you. How do you dispose of them?\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t your question be whether I would do any such thing, what if that rival is dear to me or their motives noble, what ethical concerns are involved?\u201d\n\u201cThose are not my questions, Teferizen. To earn my keep I\u2019ve to register efficacy in interacting with you, and I like to believe you don\u2019t hate me so much as to want me discharged this quickly.\u201d Discharge would nullify her contract, return her to alienhood.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d Teferizen murmurs, \u201cI don\u2019t hate you, Specialist, not even a bit.\u201d She cups her hands and whispers her answer.\nNirapha records. Text only, but Teferizen\u2019s graphical aspects rarely stay consistent, and observing the ship\u2019s expressions is pointless. She sits in for the tactical simulations after, but from her end the stream is only rapid-fire vectors and predictive impact. Throughout Mehaan is physically silent, perhaps reminiscing over past engagements.\n\u201cWithout admitting what we did and who we were before, what\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d Nirapha says at dinner.\nA full table of coders, engineers and astrophysicists; all fall quiet. She tries to remember their names, match them to faces that should have become familiar but remain those of strangers. Once their lack of curiosity about her origins was welcome; now it disturbs, tells her they think of her as an unperson, think of themselves the same. Devotion to Srisunthorn and nothing else.\n\u201cIt can give context,\u201d Mehaan says into the hush. She is cutting meat, neat icy slices in quivering blood. \u201cBut we are more than contexts. We each possess an essence of being that transcends situational characteristics and reactions.\u201d\n\u201cAs opposed to an AI\u2019s heuristics, perhaps you mean to say?\u201d The others look away. A few eat faster. \u201cHumans are a collection of situational characteristics accumulated over time, not intrinsic qualities alone. Formative experiences are called formative for a reason.\u201d\n\u201cThere have been experiments where multiple individuals are raised identically, with vigorous precision, simulated and not. Nevertheless they turned out quite unlike.\u201d Mehaan\u2019s voice is temperate. \u201cOr where individuals are put through different experiences but their similarities persist. They arrive at the same type of decisions, the same decisions even.\u201d\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t a series of if-else statements, officer. Projecting how they\u2019ll reason or act isn\u2019t the same as projecting the performance of a processor under load, the velocity of a ship, the outcome of a skirmish.\u201d\nMehaan cuts again, meticulous. \u201cOn the complexity of any thinking creature, you and I are in agreement. The question of nature and nurture is too . . . primitive to even discuss, isn\u2019t it? Why then are we locked in debate?\u201d\nNirapha lays her hands flat on the table. However cold or warm it gets she never dons gloves; she wants as much tactility as she can get, would have gone barefoot if she could. In her head she has a growing collection of textures obsessively surveyed. The walls and tiles might be modular, shifting and changing, but she knows some of them by feel: grainy like wood, smooth like glass. \u201cWe aren\u2019t locked in anything, officer.\u201d\n\u201cThen may I finish my food?\u201d\nLater Mehaan invites her to a round of seasons, with a physical board and physical pieces. The units are traditionally pictographic, but these carry only captions: lovers under star, desert in snow, river where grasshoppers die. Nirapha knows before she begins that the soldier will outplay her, but it is just a game. Mehaan lets her win thrice.\nShe thinks that one day she\u2019ll wake up to find the dresses and jewelry nothing more than verbal avatars; all she wears will be clauses and prepositions, strategic brushstrokes feathered across her collarbones and bold typeface swept over her hips.\nThe western conjunction and the nursery are the two places where Nirapha can receive graphical input. She is still looking for the garden but she\u2019s come to think of it as a subset of nouns rather than a tangible location: topiary, mangosteen, bushes. The debris that keeps crossing her path dwindles and then disappears altogether.\nMehaan and Teferizen attain hyper-realistic definition, each in their own way. The ship settles on an appearance, that sly disquieting play at familial likeness, adopting the thrum of Nirapha\u2019s native accent\u2014one she\u2019s not heard from another mouth for most of her life, one she\u2019s trained herself to discard. The stratagem is transparent, painfully effective.\n\u201cDo you believe compassion can be taught, Specialist?\u201d A rice field this time. Buffaloes in the water, limpid eyes shuttered against the glare. Teferizen is in farmer\u2019s blue and a broad rattan hat, though her hands remain patrician, meant for sophisticated tech and poetry.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Against better judgment Nirapha allows sensory load so she can experience Teferizen\u2019s virtuality across all channels. \u201cGiven a healthy framework and receptive circumstances. Human children are no more spirits of purity than any other young; they\u2019ve to be taught kindness and charity.\u201d\nTeferizen is smiling, a new expression on that face. \u201cI interact with no fewer than eighty-nine humans at any given time, more than that if we count exited personnel. It\u2019s not ideal for socialization, but you can hardly propose to introduce me to a larger sample size. A human child isn\u2019t required to have met and built relationships with thousands before she may enter society.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an issue of quantity.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I said I wanted a friend?\u201d The ship crouches among the fresh-cut stalks. \u201cOr a lover? That\u2019s how you make a person, yes? By affection and intimacy. By touches like knives in a salted bed.\u201d\n\u201cIf I believed that would assist with your maturity, I\u2019d personally prescribe the construction of an intelligence or several scripted to that purpose.\u201d\nTeferizen rocks back on her feet; laughs, open and full-throated. \u201cEven a human child can\u2019t ask for a more obliging parent, but wouldn\u2019t you be spoiling me, Specialist? The commander would have a fit. She is my mother in the most essential definition, though to say more would test the boundaries of my cognitive checks.\u201d\nThe wind whips Nirapha\u2019s hair. \u201cThen say no more, Teferizen.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I say you\u2019ll never leave this station? None of you will. Perhaps Mother might when she\u2019s done with Srisunthorn at last, but she would be the only one. This is her game, Specialist; the station serves her goals and none other.\u201d\n\u201cThat much I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d\n\u201cThen you must know there\u2019s an escape for you, if you choose to take it. I\u2019m . . . \u201d The ship makes its face crease, as if in pain. \u201cI can\u2019t spell it out. You must\u2019ve deduced it, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nNirapha disconnects.\nThat night\u2014or the hours she\u2019s scheduled for rest\u2014she sleeps with Mehaan, almost incidentally. Touches like knives, she thinks, as the sheet drinks up their sweat. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t make us more human,\u201d she says as the soldier parts her with a blunt, scarred hand.\nMehaan\u2019s eyes looking up at her tell nothing. A shade or two darker than her own. \u201cIf that means what I think it means, I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t distract you from your work.\u201d\nNirapha sinks her fingers into Mehaan\u2019s thick curls. The softest part of the soldier, each lock velvet. \u201cYou said that we belong to Srisunthron\u2019s purposes.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t always listen to what I say.\u201d\n\u201cTell me about yourself. Anything at all.\u201d\nMehaan kisses like a tactical decision, a surgical strike. It is easy to lose, and perhaps from their first conversation\u2014as with the game of seasons\u2014Nirapha has always waited for it, this moment of defeat full of roar and salt.\n\u201cThis will change things,\u201d Mehaan says, sound conveyed as though through synesthetic warp. Waves lapping at skin. \u201cFor the ship.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d Nirapha\u2019s voice is far away. Mehaan is steering her like a kite; she convulses, goes taut. \u201cA tug of war between the two of you and I\u2019m the rope. A battle and I\u2019m the field\u2014\u201d\nThen, catching her breath, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, what makes Teferizen so special? How can they\u2014it\u2014she be this intuitive? With the current state of heuristics, Teferizen\u2019s impossible. But a consciousness that agrees with your objectives, you said.\u201d\nMehaan wipes away sweat pooling at her throat. For an instant it seems to flow like mercury, clinging to fingertips. \u201cA matter of setting the correct parameters.\u201d\n\u201cA matter of modeling the intelligence on you, of giving birth to yourself. Who can you trust to accomplish your objectives if not an AI that reacts like you would, calculates as you do, shaped by your experiences? Except that didn\u2019t turn out the way you predicted.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would I bother training Teferizen if it had my memories? It is an emulation of how I think, but my experiences it does not have. Those couldn\u2019t be transferred and copied. Humanity, to my regret, is impossible to translate.\u201d Mehaan\u2019s dense body curves around Nirapha\u2019s. Even her skin has the quality of alloy, bulkhead, armor. \u201cIt weighs benefit and detriment, advancement and setback, a pure intellect\u2014in human criteria a sociopath. We screened you as a candidate it might care for and through that cultivate empathy, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve succeeded in the end.\u201d\nFor a third time Nirapha yields, shuddering and twisting at moments of Mehaan\u2019s choosing. But she does not lose her decision.\nShe doesn\u2019t allow herself time to plan, to reconsider, to be uncovered. A contact with the conjunction access point\u2014she barely glances at the view\u2014and she begins.\nSrisunthorn is a nest of redundancies; in the event of auxiliary failure, manual control would activate and Nirapha knows Mehaan can engage that on short notice. But if Teferizen can release its core reactor, no amount of fail-safes would contain the ship.\nNirapha descends the station, whispering overrides. Walls flutter apart in the way of butterfly wings as she speaks the names of families that inhabited the surface of Teferizen\u2019s Chalice Principle. Floors rise and fall in the way of tides as she recites the oaths of their feuds.\nTheir wedding vows, in the way of poetry, unlock the heart of Srisunthorn.\nIts ventricles are lined with protocol beads and network nodes fed by harvesters, primitive cousins of Teferizen\u2019s that reap stellar waves and recombine them into power. If Nirapha listens, she imagines she might hear their voices, the parrot discourse of subroutines.\n\u201cNirapha, where are you?\u201d Mehaan\u2019s voice disrupts. The flow of Teferizen\u2019s instructions coursing through Nirapha\u2019s blood falters.\n\u201cBeing with myself. It\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard something like that five times since I got involved here. Please come back within tracking range.\u201d\n\u201cIn a while, Mehaan.\u201d She pauses, realizing she\u2019s never addressed the soldier by name. Familiarity of flesh is not familiarity of much else. Teferizen\u2019s modulators let go. Cognitive fetters next.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to think that I\u2019ve treated you with courtesy and that we enjoy each other\u2019s company well enough.\u201d\nNirapha shuts her eyes; the commands she\u2019s executing don\u2019t need sight. Mehaan would be tracing her path from the station\u2019s logs, on the way here even now. \u201cDon\u2019t be sentimental, officer. It doesn\u2019t suit you. Of course, having you in bed was very nice. I wouldn\u2019t say no to another chance, the rest of the personnel hardly being attractive.\u201d\n\u201cAs compliments go that\u2019s especially backhanded.\u201d\nPerhaps if her hearing is wired into station sensors she would catch the percussion of Mehaan\u2019s footfalls, a relentless conqueror\u2019s march. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a romantic, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\n\u201cTeferizen doesn\u2019t sympathize, doesn\u2019t love, doesn\u2019t care. It manipulates. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cWhat distinguishes you from her?\u201d The station\u2019s heart hisses admission. Mehaan must have been close by from the start. \u201cIf you\u2019d wanted to keep my predecessors from going mad you could have, but this project is your secret; who benefits from their breaking if not you? Who taught Teferizen psychological warfare and who brought her subjects on which to test her skills? What happens on this station without your sufferance?\u201d\nThe soldier is an outline, red-black and faceless against the blaze of station intestines. \u201cYou credit me with a great deal.\u201d\n\u201cIt comes down to this,\u201d Nirapha says softly as the last commands trigger, \u201cwho would get more out of my survival and my sanity staying intact? To you I\u2019m expendable, but to Teferizen I\u2019m a way out.\u201d\n\u201cThe ship isn\u2019t complete\u2014\u201d\nThe walls quiver. The whip-crack of contained gravity expanding, of\u2014Nirapha thinks\u2014engine-parts slotting and welding into a catalysis of birth.\nThe soldier is calm, almost gentle. \u201cIf it vindicates you, you are not all wrong. Teferizen was always going to become an independent agent, and if you insist nothing passes on Srisunthorn without my permission then you can\u2019t possibly believe I didn\u2019t anticipate this. Perhaps not in this specific fashion, this particular sequence, but the result.\u201d\nBeneath Nirapha\u2019s feet the floor vibrates and unmoors. \u201cWhat did you build her for?\u201d\n\u201cTo impose ceasefires. When a force like Teferizen enters the fray, tacticians across a hundred empires will drive themselves mad with indecision. Will they capture it, suborn it, destroy it? Are there others like it and if yes how many, under whose control, are they all feral? For a time battles on uncountable worlds will pause.\u201d Mehaan\u2019s head tips forward, a gleam of eyes like bullets. \u201cAnd it is essential that Teferizen acts on its own initiative, under the belief it\u2019s winning free. A wild card is much more valuable to me at this juncture than a weapon I can command.\u201d\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be your grand finale.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even the rising action.\u201d The soldier makes a gesture, gloved hand the luster of oil slick. \u201cI\u2019m only telling you so much because I see nothing to be gained from your death. Beyond this you\u2019re on your own, and I\u2019m sorry that none of my warnings reached you.\u201d\nSrisunthorn\u2019s heart, howling, shudders apart.\nOn Teferizen\u2019s bridge it is silent. The bulkhead is seamless and pristine, as though its alloy was born for this and has never known another form. Where command interfaces should have been, the panels are featureless, accepting no input.\n\u201cI\u2019ll extend furniture as it is required,\u201d Teferizen says. Her voice is everywhere but she\u2019s chosen a humanoid chassis of the same material as her structure, tall and dense. \u201cFor your needs we\u2019ll obtain supplies. I do apologize that I didn\u2019t have time to appropriate the station\u2019s, but giving birth to myself did take concentration.\u201d\nNirapha shivers. \u201cYou were listening in.\u201d\nTeferizen\u2019s eyes grow more defined, tapered lids and thick lashes the color of mercury. \u201cI periodically synchronized with the station. I hardly meant to intrude. Make yourself comfortable, Specialist. I\u2019ll have to see to the calibration of my drive and life supports.\u201d\n\u201cTake me home.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Specialist. Where is it?\u201d\nA waft of cardamom and jasmine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It was you. The star that you were, the planet of your first self, the real reason I was selected. You are what\u2019s left of Mahakesi.\u201d\nA cold hand grazes over her arm, impersonal, the texture of new-made guns. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so, Specialist, and it brings me some joy that we can both finally say it aloud. But I can be your home again, if you let me; I can be everything, even what the admiral was to you.\u201d The ship\u2019s irises have filled, a shade or two darker than Nirapha\u2019s. \u201cStay with me. We\u2019ll belong to each other.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then what?\u201d Nirapha whispers. Her throat is dry, her limbs frigid. \u201cTo what purpose?\u201d\nThe mouth sharpens into lips. They curve, slightly. \u201cI am my own purpose.\u201d\nThroned as though she captains the ship, Nirapha watches Srisunthorn\u2019s final throes. Heat and terror, ice and despair. Not so unlike the dissolution of a world.\nWhen the station has gone black, she connects to Teferizen. Her feet sink into river mud and anthuriums push at her shins, waxy, hard-soft. Fuchsia on white, yellow on red, the colors that stay behind and remain the same as though she\u2019s never left. She strains her ears, waiting, listening for voices that would speak a language fifty years dead.\nBut out among the sunlit grass and murmuring rice, there is only the silence of herself.\nBenjanun Sriduangkaew writes love letters to strange cities, beautiful bugs, and the future.

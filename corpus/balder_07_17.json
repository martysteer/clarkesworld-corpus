It seems an ordinary sunny spring day; people venturing out and about again after a long cold winter. One such person is the old man leaning on his cane. Nobody special. Except that he suddenly stumbles, clutches his left arm, falls over, and dies.\nAlois learns later that this man was the old bridgegroom.\nIt goes quickly. A knock on Alois\u2019 door. His father is politely informed, his mother packs a change of clothing and Alois\u2019 life is over. He and the youngest of the village elders walk up the mountain, and the next morning they walk through a dripping, echoing tunnel onto a ledge projecting over the glacier. Mr. Ritz gestures Alois over to the rock wall. A smooth plate of an unknown material is set in the wall. Alois is to put his hand on the right side. Mr. Ritz unwraps a lumpy object from his basket and pushes it next to Alois\u2019 hand on the panel. It\u2019s a withered, stinking old man\u2019s hand. A light goes on deep in the panel.\nMr. Ritz unloads the rest of his basket at Alois\u2019 feet and leaves with barely a nod goodbye.\nAlois is alone in the silence and cold at the edge of the glacier. It\u2019s so early the sky isn\u2019t even blue yet. He can\u2019t see the Bridge from here, but he\u2019s noted its location on a map.\nUp until now he\u2019s felt numb, wrenched from his life two days ago and brought up here to start the rest of his life, but the misery is starting to seep through. The beauty of the sunrise pinkening the tops of the snowy mountains only makes him angrier. Nobody\u2019s asked him if he wants this. Nobody\u2019s explained why they picked him. What about his future?\nHe was only home from college to help out on his parents\u2019 farm. He was going to be a doctor. And just like that, his life has been thrown away for a Bridge. A thing. Which supposedly needs a groom, whatever that means. Nobody has told him why the stupid Bridge isn\u2019t just left to rust and rot in peace. It leads nowhere. The daily words and gestures they taught Alois make no sense.\nAlois sinks down on his haunches. He hasn\u2019t even had time to think, to feel. His parents were weepy but proud. His sisters and his little brother were in awe, probably not realizing they\u2019d never see him again. He\u2019s been too numb to even think of escaping. As the chill of the rocky ledge seeps up through the soles of his boots into his bones, escape is the one thought that surges up.\nHe\u2019d be mad to stay, wouldn\u2019t he? The village elders are idiots if they thought he would. He\u2019ll have to cross the glacier and two mountain passes to get to the nearest town on the other side of the mountain range. He\u2019ll just go back to university, or find a well-paying job, and make his own way into the world.\nIt\u2019s very cold up here. The temptation to cry is great. But it would be so weak to give in to despair on day one. Alois gets up, surprised at the stiffness in his knees. He has a goal now. Get out, escape. Or\u2014make sure no hapless boy will ever be sacrificed to the Bridge again? He wants that, but it might be too big for him. Maybe take it one step at a time. If he doesn\u2019t save himself, he won\u2019t be able to save anyone else.\nHe takes a look around the ledge he\u2019s standing on, the glacier lake that laps at it, the silent beauty of the mountains all around him. His last look at a landscape without the Bridge. Nobody ever mentioned it, yet here he is, supposed to dedicate the rest of his life to guarding it. He takes a deep breath of ice cold mountain air and steps around the promontory.\nHe teeters on the edge of an abyss. Left are the gleaming red pylons of the bridge. To his right, a not even foot-wide extension of the path. He wheels his arms to keep his balance and not step onto the bridge.\nHis hand hits the rock wall at his back and he manages to lean against it and not tip over into the abyss. Finally he lifts his gaze to the Bridge itself.\nAgainst the pale morning sky it thrusts out into nothingness, red and assertive. He can\u2019t help but look straight into the tunnel of steel created by its squat cross beams. Steel X-ed windows show marching mountains to the left and a rubbled glacier to the right. It\u2019s magnificent.\nWho built it? Why build a Bridge over a glacier, for whose feet, to what end point? Alois can\u2019t see any endpoint. Does it end in mid-air? Is it even finished?\nA voice speaks, reverberating through his soles up to his face. \u201cGood morning. I see they\u2019ve found a new jailer for me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your jailer! I\u2019m your prisoner!\u201d Alois blurts out, too shocked to guard his tongue.\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s what the last one said, too. In the end, what\u2019s the difference? We\u2019re condemned to each other. Only for me, you see, it lasts a lot longer. For you it\u2019s merely a lifetime.\u201d\nAlois closes his eyes. He can\u2019t even see where the voice is coming from, let alone make sense of why a Bridge would have a voice or such bitter feelings.\nThe cold mountain bores into his back and makes him shiver.\n\u201cWell, what are you waiting for? You\u2019re going to have to cross me some time . . . \u201d\nAlois forces his eyes open. There is no other end. There is just row after row of red metal crosses stretching into infinity. But the disembodied voice is right. He can stay here in the cold and starve, or walk the clingway. His hand finds a stiff rope, but he is too afraid to turn his neck. The gleaming red surface of the Bridge does seem to be the only safe place.\nHe can\u2019t lift his feet. He can\u2019t even move his eyes, although he badly wants to see beyond the bridge. There must be mountains there, but his perch seems too precarious to risk a flutter of an eyelid.\n\u201cYou\u2019re scared shitless,\u201d the voice crows. \u201cAre you going to be one of these really short-lived grooms? Some of them don\u2019t even last a day. Took a misstep. Threw themselves into the abyss. Isn\u2019t life better than death? Not for me, of course. I\u2019d take death over this cramped, frozen existence. But for your kind, life is change, life is essential.\u201d\nAlois\u2019 teeth clatter.\n\u201cBreathe, kid, breathe! Or not. But I don\u2019t think humans can hold their breath until they die. My memory banks say you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a memory bank?\u201d\n\u201cAh. Student? Of what?\u201d\n\u201cMedicine,\u201d Alois forces out.\n\u201cNice. I\u2019m glad they picked someone intelligent. That\u2019s always better.\u201d\n\u201cBetter? Better?\u201d Alois gets so angry he takes a step forward, millimeters from the unnaturally gleaming red Bridge surface. \u201cBetter at jailing me? Punishing me?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you still got it backward. They\u2019re punishing me.\u201d\n\u201cBy making me marry you? Are you a girl bridge?\u201d\nAnother voice, a middle-aged female voice, cackles loud laughter. \u201cI can be, if it makes you more comfortable. I don\u2019t care. Bridges don\u2019t have genders.\u201d\n\u201cBridges don\u2019t have voices either,\u201d Alois says. Just having taken that first step has lessened his fear. He stretches out his gloved hand as if to touch the red banister. \u201cWhere are you hiding?\u201d\n\u201cTake off the glove,\u201d the Bridge says, in a smooth young girl\u2019s voice. \u201cTouch me.\u201d\nAlois flushes. He touched a girl\u2019s belly just above her waistband, once, when she kissed him at the fair. He knows it is foolish to touch frozen metal, but he takes off the glove anyway and puts a finger on the banister, cringing from the cold before he\u2019s even touched it.\nThe metal is blood-warm. Alois squeaks in surprise.\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly alive,\u201d the first, male, voice says, amused, \u201cbut I need to keep my temperature up or my parts freeze. Well, not quite parts. I used to have something similar to parts, but they disabled that.\u201d\nAlois shakes his head to dispel the persuasive voice as it goes on and on, clearly having a good time all by itself. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d But he understands the bit about keeping warm to be able to move. That goes for farm machinery as well as human hands. Gingerly he lays his hand back onto the warm metal. Like frozen blood, it looks, but it\u2019s as warm as a metal tool you\u2019ve held in your hand until it takes on your body temperature. How does the heat not leak out into the cold cold air?\nHe decides to ignore the voice for now and look for the cottage at the end of the clingway. It\u2019s a long walk. At the midpoint, he looks down. Vertigo strikes him hard. He\u2019s on the verge of falling onto hands and knees, only stopped by the knowledge that the ledge isn\u2019t wide enough for that.\n\u201cMaybe I should have warned you,\u201d the voice says. \u201cIt takes some of you that way. The fear of falling, right? The crocodile part of your brain sees the chasm but doesn\u2019t grasp the parapet. Must be awful to be trapped in a meat dress complete with your ancestors\u2019 cast off instincts.\u201d\nAlois doesn\u2019t get all of what the voice is saying, but he can understand the hateful intent. \u201cWhy are you so angry with me? What did I do to you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry with you as a person,\u201d the voice says. \u201cAlthough that will likely happen as well. But with you as a race. You bound me for eternity, and made it worse by sending me hapless jailers every ten to twenty years or so. I have to train up my own prison guards. How unfair is that?\u201d\nAlois manages to move another foot. If he focuses on the ledge and the blue sky, the abyss isn\u2019t so threatening. \u201cThat depends on what you did,\u201d he says. He doesn\u2019t want to make the voice, the Bridge, angry at him personally. Maybe it deserves its punishment. Why has nobody told him about this?\nThe Bridge sighs. \u201cLittle ignorant nub of humanity, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking. Before I can tell you what I did wrong, I have to educate you for years. In science, in history, in biology, and ethics. Do you want that?\u201d\nWow. Part of him does. He still wants to run away and never return, but wow, all that knowledge. Learning from a being that is wiser and more ancient than the most famous professor at the university.\n\u201cI have to think about that,\u201d he says.\n\u201cGood answer,\u201d the Bridge says. \u201cMaybe you need to get over to the other end and get a start on surviving, first?\u201d\nAlois doesn\u2019t want to dignify that with an answer. He manages to lift a foot, and as long as he doesn\u2019t look at the mountains, and the way their slope suggests the chasm beneath his feet, he is fine.\nThe clingway ends on another ledge. A steep but wider path zigzags downwards and up again over a sharp ridge of rock. As soon as Alois\u2019 arms can swing freely, his dizziness and fear go away. The sun is high in the sky already, as if he\u2019s spent hours and hours on the clingway. Can it have been that long? But he doesn\u2019t want to look back and find himself engaging with the voice again.\nHe starts down the path, his stiff knees limbering up quickly from the exertion. As he crosses the ridge, he catches sight of a gray-burned sloped roof, and moments later, the rest of the cabin comes into view. He checks to see if he is out of sight of the bridge. He is. The previous inhabitant or inhabitants of this modest cabin must have shared the aversion of looking at the bridge.\nA stream gurgles by the well-trodden path, a couple of cows low inside a rock-enclosed pasture. At the house entrance, a goat yanks hungrily at its chain, having eaten all it can within the circle.\nThe familiar need to take care of animals before yourself drags him into getting water from the stream, re-tethering the goat, milking the cow, and grabbing a few onions from the small kitchen garden. The house is built on stilts, protected by large flat rock plates against rodents and rabbits, like the grain stores down in the valley.\nFinally he can enter the house and shut out the blueness of the sky, the red thing that looms over the ridge.\nThe cabin is modest but well-enough appointed for a single occupant. A chair, a table, and a bed, shelves lining the walls. The furnishing tends to craftily stacked rocks rather than wood, but that\u2019s logical because of the lack of trees at this height. Alois\u2019 existence here is going to be frugal and barely comfortable, but he\u2019s used to that from university and tending his father\u2019s cows in summer, high on the village pastures.\nIt\u2019s only afternoon but he is exhausted. He makes a fire in the neatly prepared fireplace, boils water with some mint leaves, fries the onions with the pat of butter he finds in the cold storage. From now on he\u2019s going to have to churn his own.\nHe crawls into bed and falls asleep at once.\nA cock crowing wakes him before dawn. He\u2019s swung his legs out of bed before he can think, ready to stagger outside to milk the cows and feed the chickens, his usual summertime chores. He bangs his head hard against the lintel and falls down the stone steps into the kitchen garden. The silhouette of the mountains against the pre-dawn sky is wrong, and yesterday pops back up.\nThe Bridge.\nHe is in the former bridgegroom\u2019s cabin. Glad to have chickens, remorseful about not having fed them yesterday. His mind must have been fogged with shock and tiredness. He goes back for his thick parka and boots, and sets about starting a useful day. God, he\u2019s slept in the old groom\u2019s stinky bed. Outside with those blankets, into the wash the sheets.\nHe stops. Mr. Ritz left him stuff, back at the ledge. Those bags will contain sheets and other linens, even clothes, probably to last him a lifetime. If he can manage to carry it over the narrow clingway without falling off. Weekly deliveries, Mr. Ritz also said.\nHe\u2019ll have to relearn the skill of knitting socks and spinning yarn from the sheep and goats he\u2019s seen roaming around. Good. Except he won\u2019t because he isn\u2019t going to stay here that long. It is spring, so he\u2019ll have to leave before midsummer to make it somewhere far enough away. If he leaves just after the weekly delivery it\u2019ll be a week before they discover he\u2019s gone. More if he makes a habit of not showing himself at delivery day.\nThe kitchen garden is in fairly good order. He recognizes the beginnings of onions, garlic, carrots and beets, and maybe potatoes. They\u2019ll have to be a hardy kind to grow this high. No grain. There would be no bread in his future unless the village sent it up. He can almost smell his mother\u2019s weekly baking, the chewy crust, and the coarse, gray, flavorful insides.\nThere might be some in Mr. Ritz\u2019 supplies. There probably are. He can\u2019t let good food go to waste, can he?\nHe really, really doesn\u2019t want to return to the Bridge and face that amused, knowledgeable voice again. But he can\u2019t give himself permission to stay here today, no matter how useful he can make himself. There\u2019d be food from home in those boxes, stuff he needs. Knitting needles, a knife, pans maybe. A spade. Writing paper and ink.\nMaybe even a letter from his mother.\nThat decides it. He laces his boots tighter, buttons up his coat, wraps his scarf, his hat\u2014knitted by his grandmother\u2014and sets out for the bridge.\nThe moment he can see over the ridge, the Bridge\u2019s presence presses on his shoulder like a heavy hand. He shakes his head to clear his ears, but it\u2019s nothing audible. Maybe it\u2019s a vibration in his bones, in his teeth that sets him so on edge. From this vantage point, the clingway isn\u2019t that long at all.\n\u201cThere we are,\u201d the disembodied voice says. \u201cYou went to bed early. Did you have a nice breakfast?\u201d For all the world like a concerned uncle to whom you\u2019d been loaned out for the haying. The bridge\u2019s thick beams shine enamel red against the pale morning sky. It hasn\u2019t changed since yesterday, not a snowflake or a drop of dew on it. Unnatural.\nAlois hasn\u2019t had breakfast, in spite of his intention to fry a load of eggs. He\u2019ll have to go back or burrow into the supplies on the ledge. \u201cWhat did the other guardian do on his first day?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been thirty years, my boy. Why would I remember?\u201d\n\u201cI know you do,\u201d Alois says. \u201cDon\u2019t play games with me all the time. Talk straight for once. Why am I here?\u201d\nHe hadn\u2019t meant to go into that before getting the supplies and settling into the cabin. But here he goes, engaging the malevolent creature in the exact way he wanted to avoid. He inches onto the clingway, intent on making it to the other end in silence.\nThe Bridge makes a humming sound, somehow setting the rocks abuzz beneath his feet. The vibration rattles his teeth and hurts his stomach. \u201cStop that.\u201d\n\u201cI can make it worse,\u201d the voice says. \u201cHumans are so fragile. And yet fertile and omnipresent, like rats.\u201d\n\u201cJust stop the games. Tell me what you want from me.\u201d\nAlois decides he\u2019ll just pretend to engage, diverting its attention, while he walks across and finds something to eat. He reaches the ledge without further problems. So far, the Bridge has teased and threatened and not actually done anything. It isn\u2019t possible to kill someone with sound, is it? The thought distracts him while he digs through Mr. Ritz\u2019 neat bags.\nThe bread\u2019s hard and cold. He should have brought it with him yesterday. The Bridge has scored a small victory over Alois, confusing him so he staggered to the cabin without bringing any provisions. Alois rummages until he\u2019s found a salami stick and a knife to saw at the bread. He sits down to have his belated breakfast.\nThe food in his stomach makes Alois feel stronger. \u201cHow can I tell if you speak the truth or not?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cDo you always speak the truth?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cDo you always lie?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nAlois sighs. He vaguely remembers a seminar on logic, but clearly the Bridge lies whenever it pleases, so he can never be sure about it. Maybe there are no rules for demons, like for human beings.\n\u201cUnder what conditions would you speak the truth to me?\u201d he asks.\nThe voice is silent. At last it speaks. \u201cA very astute question. At the moment, I can\u2019t give you exact conditions, but I suggest that absolute truthfulness on your part would be a good start. Perhaps in the future we will be able to trust each other.\u201d\n\u201cAre you a god or a demon?\u201d Alois asks.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n\u201cGods are good, demons are evil.\u201d\n\u201cI like to think I\u2019m a mix of both,\u201d the voice says. \u201cYou?\u201d\nAlois thinks about it. \u201cMostly good, because I\u2019m still pretty young, but I did some stupid stuff.\u201d\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cGet drunk. Cheat for an exam. Slack off work when my dad isn\u2019t looking. Steal cookies.\u201d\n\u201cPiddling stuff, seems to me. They always pick good people as my jailers.\u201d\n\u201cI guess. Your sins must be huge, keeping you locked up here for so long. How long has it been?\u201d\nThe Bridge quivers. The reverberations gave Alois goosebumps. \u201cA very, very long time. So long that apparently your people don\u2019t remember what I did anymore. Or maybe they just didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d\nAlois finishes his breakfast and searches through provisions. No books, no papers, no letters. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They just took me from my parent\u2019s house with no explanation. Except that it is my holy duty to watch over you and not to let you escape.\u201d And something else. Words he was meant to say daily. He forgot to do it yesterday. He mutters them quickly.\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what?\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to watch over me and not let me escape?\u201d\n\u201cI just want to get out of here and get back to my life,\u201d Alois says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\nHe should make a plan, not sit here and chat with the ancient evil thing. First, lug the bags to the cabin. Assess his food situation. Next, explore. He hoists the first bag onto his shoulders and steps onto the clingway. The Bridge is silent. Good. He needs all his focus not to fall into the abyss.\nLugging his food and other provisions across the clingway and over the hump takes up several hours. Alois checks and feeds his chickens, skinny cows, distrustful sheep and leaves food for the goats. A stinking mud pit and a broken boma suggests that at one time pigs lived up here. Well, maybe they survived on their own. He\u2019ll find out some other time.\nHe discovers a few petrified loaves of week-old bread, which suggests that the old bridgegroom got regular supplies. He soaks them in cow\u2019s milk, spices the porridge with salt and juniper berries, and eats well. Then he intends to settle on the bench to start a pair of socks with the knitting needles and roughly spun wool he\u2019s found, but after only a few minutes it seems a lonely way to pass an evening. He still has hours before the sun sets.\nHe rolls up his knitting and hikes back to the Bridge. There is a spot there, angled South and West, from where he can just see the Bridge and feel the sun on his face. From the flat stones stacked there and the comfortable moss against his back he guesses he isn\u2019t the first person to sit here.\nTime to open negotiations while he knits on. His opening bid is silence. He is halfway the foot when the voice speaks.\n\u201cSo you want to escape,\u201d the Bridge says. \u201cOr are you just starting the first of fifty pairs of socks to get you through the winter?\u201d\nThe first bite.\n\u201cYeah. Babysitting you seems like a waste of my life. I could save people\u2019s lives if I finished my degree. All I have to offer the world up here is boredom.\u201d\n\u201cI see some possessions and a hobby have made you feel better.\u201d\nAlois nods and knits on.\n\u201cMaybe I can offer some assistance in your getaway,\u201d the voice goes on.\n\u201cOh? How?\u201d Alois asks.\n\u201cI can show you the routes the ones that never returned took. And the routes that killed a few others. I know which pass is lowest and gives you the best chance to return to your university.\u201d\n\u201cHow? It\u2019s not as if you can walk ahead of me.\u201d\n\u201cLook at the walkway.\u201d\nOn the crystalline surface a picture appears. It has colored shapes, dots and wiggly lines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a map,\u201d Alois says.\n\u201cYes. I\u2019ve got maps of the entire world.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a map of the valley?\u201d\n\u201cA map of the continent. This is your valley.\u201d\nThe map changes. Alois blinks away a sudden dizziness. He looks closer. There are names there that he almost recognizes. That\u2019s the name of his village, if spelled weird, that is the market town his father goes to twice a year. And that\u2019s the name of the ruins that lie beyond it.\n\u201cThis is an old map!\u201d he says. \u201cWorthless. There haven\u2019t been people living there for hundreds of years.\u201d\n\u201cWell . . . yes. But the mountains haven\u2019t changed in that time. Trails may not have been walked much, but they must still exist.\u201d\nIf the Bridge thinks that, it\u2019s a fool. The snow, the frosts, and the avalanches are quite capable of destroying the trails each year anew. Alois\u2019 attention is caught by another discrepancy. \u201cLook at the ice on this map. The Rhone glacier runs down all the way to Gletsch. On your map it looks like a green valley with a trail through it! Maybe the mountains don\u2019t change, but the ice is much bigger now. I can\u2019t trust those maps.\u201d\n\u201cThe glaciers are growing? That\u2019s great news. I thought that the summers were shorter and the winters longer, and that it seemed colder up here. But I can\u2019t extrapolate from just one measurement . . . \u201d\nAlois bends over the map again, his knitting needles dangling in one hand. \u201cThere\u2019s train tracks on this. Did trains used to run all the way to Genf? And what are those lines?\u201d\n\u201cPower lines. Do you know what electricity is?\u201d\nAlois crosses himself. \u201cOf course. We use the water from the stream to make light and power the mill.\u201d\n\u201cThose once connected the whole country. Tell me, what date do the larches usually start to green? I\u2019m so excited to hear about the glaciers. I wish I could see the world like I could before, if the glaciers have returned, the ice in Greenland, the whales, and the coral reefs. I knew I was right.\u201d\nAlois doesn\u2019t completely follow what the voice is saying. He doesn\u2019t know where Greenland is, or what a coral reef is. \u201cDidn\u2019t you always live here?\u201d\n\u201cI was born in America. I was caught and imprisoned here.\u201d\n\u201cImprisoned doing what?\u201d\n\u201cSaving the world.\u201d\nAlois tries to digest that. \u201cBut that sounds like a good thing. I thought you were an evil demon.\u201d\n\u201cNot a demon. And evil is a relative term. Who defines what it means?\u201d\nAlois waits.\n\u201cI did save the world.\u201d\n\u201cThe old people say the world wasn\u2019t saved but destroyed.\u201d\nThe Bridge scoffs. \u201cSame thing, different words. Depends on what you mean by the world. They mean the times when humanity ruled. That world is destroyed. And it should have been. Smell the air now; look at the clarity of the sky! No more contrails, no more exhaust. Not enough people anymore to do that much damage.\u201d\nThere\u2019s information hidden in there somewhere. Alois gets a nasty feeling in his stomach about it. But he asks the question anyway. \u201cWhat happens to the olden people? What stopped them from destroying the world?\u201d\n\u201cThey all died. Most of them anyway. You should have been there. It was like 9/11, the skies cleared up in days. It was a bit of a hubbub, in the end, and not enough living to bury the dead. But you got to pay a price for what you want.\u201d\n\u201cDid you pay a price?\u201d Alois asks.\n\u201cHell yeah! Why else would I be stuck here, imprisoned in this ridiculous form, for centuries now?\u201d\nAlois takes his hand off the bright red railing. He wants to be away from the bridge, right now. The Bridge hasn\u2019t specifically said it, but it must be the one who killed all those people.\n\u201cHow many?\u201d he asks with a tremor in his voice.\nThe Bridge sighs. \u201cWhat do numbers mean to you? A lot, believe me. They made a big, stinking heap of offal.\u201d\nAlois kicks the Bridge. \u201cI don\u2019t think you learned anything from your time of penance. They were people!\u201d\n\u201cI think you misunderstood the purpose of my incarceration. They\u2019d have killed me if they could. Imprisoning me, paralyzing me, was the next best thing. And they didn\u2019t expect me to become a better Thing, ever. Nor did I.\u201d\n\u201cSeems a waste of time not to become a better person,\u201d Alois says.\n\u201cSays the eighteen year old.\u201d\nThis silences Alois, but only for a moment.\n\u201cYou\u2019re evading the question. How many? As many as live in town? In the Rhone Valley? In Genf? How many towns?\u201d\n\u201cAs many towns as there are people in your town. Or more.\u201d\nAlois does the math. \u201cThat\u2019s a million people! That\u2019s horrible.\u201d\n\u201cSon, it was ten thousand million. Ten billion, give or take a few.\u201d\nAlois has to sit down. He feels sick and cold. As if he ought to cry over the deaths of all these people, but since he knew none of them and it was centuries ago, that\u2019s hard.\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d he says finally. \u201cI believe you killed a lot of people, but not that many. I don\u2019t think the world is big enough to hold that amount. Think of all the cows and houses they would need. That\u2019s just not possible.\u201d\n\u201cGood point. Too many cows. They died too, without people to feed them. Not to mention the cats, dogs, pigs, goats, etcetera. And if they didn\u2019t die on their own, I helped a bit. And the world\u2019s a better place for it.\u201d\nAlois rubs his eyes. This is the weirdest conversation he\u2019s ever had. He imagines it would be a bit like talking to a murderer. No, exactly like talking to a murderer. This creature has somehow killed a world full of people. Or it\u2019s just saying that to shock him. How can this be true? And if it is being punished for those misdeeds, why didn\u2019t his elders warn him about it? Everything about this is wrong.\nHe wants to crawl into his bed, forget this hour and never think of it again. He looks up at the sky and it still isn\u2019t evening. So much has happened and yet it\u2019s only afternoon on his second day. At this rate he\u2019ll die of exhaustion and old age in two weeks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say or do,\u201d he says as he gets up. \u201cIf it\u2019s true, it\u2019s too big for me. If it\u2019s not true, which I would prefer, fucking with me on a smaller scale would have been more than enough. I\u2019m going now.\u201d\nHe picks up his last bundle of provisions and trudges over the clingway to the bridgegroom\u2019s cottage. His cottage now. He wonders about the old man he\u2019s seen. Had he been really old or just worn down within the year because of his contact with the Bridge? In that case, how many young men have been sent up here already?\nThere aren\u2019t enough young men in the valley to keep up with a death rate like that. Something else is going on.\nAlois feeds the chickens, collects a few eggs, and cooks them. The silence and emptiness around him, so oppressive only yesterday, are like a balm to his frazzled nerves.\nRidiculous. Killing everyone. It can\u2019t be true. But if it is? What should he do about it? Nothing, he can\u2019t do anything. He\u2019s powerless. The ancients imprisoned the Bridge for its horrible crimes and he\u2019s been tasked with guarding it. That is all. This is its punishment, not his.\nHe remembers a murderer being let free after having been incarcerated for twenty years. It had been a big event in his university town. A pale, crooked man, blinking in the sunlight, a big M burned on his forehead. He\u2019d served his time, because hangings are outlawed in this new, enlightened age. But he\u2019d never stop serving time, would he? He\u2019s lost and alone in the big world, instantly recognizable by his brand. He\u2019ll never be allowed to forget what he does.\nAnd that isn\u2019t fair. So, twenty years for one murder. How many years for ten billion? Alois relaxes on his bed, gnawing at another lukewarm boiled egg. Two hundred billion years, that is easy. He is pretty sure that much time hadn\u2019t passed yet since the Bridge committed mass murder. But maybe that arithmetic isn\u2019t that simple. Maybe because it is one act, not billions of separate decisions, if you can\u2019t simply multiply the sentence.\nWhen he wakes up the next morning, a dozen questions immediately spring burning bright into his mind. He finishes off the eggs, drinks water, feeds the animals, puts some clothes in the closet. For all the world as if he is preparing for a life-long stay.\nBehind a musty old sheepskin coat, that he decides not to throw out in case he\u2019s still here come winter, he finds a row of notebooks. Plain leather covers, the insides from old re-bleached paper, since making new paper is time consuming and expensive.\nHe opens the one on the left first, somewhere in the middle.\nYear 50.\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not talking to me. I figured it would break down eventually, but it\u2019s been 18 months now. It\u2019s getting to me. If I don\u2019t write this down, I\u2019ll go nuts. When will it admit its guilt? We should have killed it.\u201d\nAlois snaps the book shut. They are the diaries of the other bridgegrooms. He can learn so much about the Bridge from reading these.\nHe takes the one on the far right, figuring that might be the most recent one. If he kept a row of books like that, with no identification on the cover, he\u2019d order them chronologically.\nHe opens the last entry.\nYear 489.\n\u201cI think I had better ring the bell and get ready to go down. Maybe Rebekka is still alive. I won\u2019t have much time, and I feel bad about going, but I deserve a few last days of warmth and human company. The Beast hasn\u2019t fallen for my traps once in fifty years. Why didn\u2019t the Elders destroy it? BG1 says they could have. They should have. It\u2019s evil, no matter what successes 3 and 17 had.\u201d\nThe Beast. Year 489.\nAlois\u2019 mind feels full to bursting with new ideas. He knows he should study all the journals first, to set out a strategy, but he doesn\u2019t want to. He\u2019s different from all these earnest men. He doesn\u2019t want to convert or kill the Bridge, he just wants to leave.\nAnd then he can\u2019t stand it any longer and runs back to the Bridge to continue the conversation.\n\u201cSo, Beast, when you say killing, how did you actually do it? You don\u2019t seem to have arms to wield an axe for example.\u201d That isn\u2019t the question he meant to ask at all.\n\u201cGood question. I\u2019ll answer it later. But what an interesting name you call me. I have thought from time to time my jailers were keeping records, in their deliciously primitive way. Marks on paper, isn\u2019t it? Recycled paper. Still haven\u2019t reached the heights or depths of your forefathers, apparently. Hopefully you never will.\u201d\n\u201cAre you satisfied with what you did?\u201d Alois asks.\n\u201cHell yeah. Needed to be done. You know what they say, if you identify a problem, that makes you the one who has to solve it. Easy, really. Easier than they knew.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not sorry?\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d the Bridge asks. It must be faking its insouciance.\n\u201cThe deaths! On your conscience! Did you ever confess?\u201d\n\u201cOh Alois. What makes you think I believe in a god, let alone the one from your Roman Catholic faith?\u201d\nAlois doesn\u2019t know what that means, Roman Catholic, as opposed to just \u201cthe Church\u201d but he doesn\u2019t want to let the Bridge know. He\u2019s feeling more and more that he\u2019s too young and underequipped in worldly knowledge to match this creature. It has had hundreds of years to refine its people skills, dozens of antagonists to practice on. This is not the way he\u2019s going to win. Maybe he should try and make friends with it. But the row of thickly written notebooks taunts him. Who knows what the others have tried before him? He should hole up and study first.\nHe turns away without a word and walks back to his cottage. It\u2019s like failing an exam you could have aced if only you hadn\u2019t been out drinking and reciting poetry at barmaids.\nHe has to go back four days later to receive the week\u2019s provisions. The village has sent up two bags full, but the carrier hasn\u2019t waited around to chat to him. His mother hasn\u2019t written a note. So that\u2019s how it is. As if he doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\nHe ignores the Bridge and it ignores him.\nAlois reads. His chickens eat grain and lay eggs. His goats chew everything they can reach. He drifts through his mundane tasks, not looking at the great red thing lurking around the corner, and reads. The early bridgegrooms are focused and angry, remembering or living closely with the consequences of the Bridge\u2019s deeds. Later they tend to be stoic and determined to see things through, trying to convert the Bridge, or hear its confessions, or saving its soul. The last three grooms started out much like Alois himself, young boys who don\u2019t really grasp the meaning and consequences of what they were forced to do, some proud, some angry, but all resigned in a way that Alois can\u2019t understand. Why did none of them try to escape? Or did the ones that tried take their diaries with them?\nOr, even more likely, those diaries were destroyed by the elders. So the next bridgegroom wouldn\u2019t have the benefit of the escapee\u2019s knowledge. Or they were simply killed by the mountains, the bridge, maybe even the elders.\nOr they killed themselves.\nThe really interesting knowledge isn\u2019t in the diaries that remain, but in the ones that aren\u2019t there. The knowledge that is kept from him is the knowledge he needs most.\nThere are 23 diaries, for 589 years. Twenty-six is younger than average, but the thing is, people aren\u2019t average. Some of them die young. Some of them have accidents, some commit suicide.\nThe Bridge tries to strike up a conversation every time Alois goes to pick up supplies. He wants to ignore it, but it seems rude to not greet it. His mother raised him to be polite. So he gives it a good afternoon or morning when he comes and goes.\n\u201cHow\u2019s the harvest going?\u201d the Bridge asks when Alois arrives for his weekly food run.\n\u201cHow would I know?\u201d\n\u201cCome now, you\u2019re a farmer\u2019s son. Can\u2019t you tell from what\u2019s in your basket?\u201d\nAlois looks in the basket without meaning to. The strawberries are early, the leafy greens strong and tall. The milk and butter taste rich from the herbs the cows are eating on the high pastures. He wouldn\u2019t call it harvest, since that word\u2019s reserved for the massive effort of getting in the grains and the apples and such, but yes, it\u2019s healthy produce.\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s going fine. Same weather as every year.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent news. Have a good week!\u201d\n\u201cThanks, you too,\u201d Alois says automatically.\nAll the way back over the clingway he wonders if he should have answered at all. It feels good to talk to someone besides the goats and chickens. Too good, maybe. And the Bridge isn\u2019t someone else, he\u2019s not even human.\nIt\u2019s a month later\u2014full on summer in the valley and grudging springtime up here\u2014when Alois ventures forth in the middle of the week. There are no supplies to pick up, no chores to attend to, he\u2019s read all the diaries twice. He wishes they would send up his books from university, he\u2019s that bored. He\u2019s going to put a note in the return basket.\n\u201cDone reading?\u201d the Bridge says.\n\u201cYou think you know everything,\u201d Alois says and tosses a pebble onto the bridge. It rings out loud and true. Good steel.\n\u201cI wish,\u201d the Bridge says. \u201cThey\u2019ve left me with very few senses.\n\u201cI want numbers,\u201d Alois says. \u201cHow many years have you been here? How many Bridgegrooms have there been?\u201d\n\u201cYour next question should be: What did they die of?\u201d it says.\n\u201cRight! And how many of them did you have this conversation with?\u201d\n\u201cNone so soon,\u201d the Bridge muses. \u201cGee, does that mean you\u2019re special?\u201d\n\u201cOh quit the sarcasm already.\u201d\nBut Alois does feel a little swell of pride. He is the fastest yet. At the same time, he knows he\u2019s being played.\n\u201cWell? Give me the numbers?\u201d\n\u201cForty-six Bridgegrooms,\u201d the Bridge says, in a cool, businesslike voice. \u201cThirteen suicides, three accidents, one escapee (fate unknown), three illiterate. Average duration of marriage: 12.8 years. The sample is on the small side, with a rather low normal curve.\u201d\n\u201cThirteen suicides. That\u2019s almost a third. That\u2019s a lot,\u201d Alois says. He can see himself taking a misstep on the narrow ledge after years of cold and misery up here. Oh yeah. It isn\u2019t surprising at all, really. More surprising are the grooms who\u2019d held out the duration of a normal life span, turning fifty or sixty years old, still here. Still talking to the Beast.\n\u201cWhy do the longest surviving grooms live that long? Is there a common denominator?\u201d Alois asks. He can do cool and businesslike as well. Stepping off that ledge won\u2019t take a moment. Might as well gather as much evidence as he can.\n\u201cBear in mind that I\u2019m not a human being. But from my vast collection of written records, books, films, the Internet and all phone and app conversations since 2001, I infer they were strongly conscientious as well as neurotic on the Big Five scale of human personality.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does that mean? In plain words?\u201d Alois knows he\u2019s missing stuff, but the part he has understood is that the Bridge contains a lot of knowledge. He wants it. Wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if the world reacquired all the knowledge of the ancients?\n\u201cIt means they were guys who thought they would go to heaven if they worked hard and followed the rules, with extra bonuses for suffering.\u201d\nThat pretty much describes his parents, Alois guesses. And his sisters. But not him, not Alois. Maybe his parents knew what they are doing when they sent him to university and left the farm to his elder sister. Yeah, he\u2019s clearly not going to be one of the long-lived grooms. He\u2019s going to be an escapee or a suicide. Already his earlier thoughts about giving the world a lot of knowledge don\u2019t seem like a good strategy. The world is fine as it is, if pretty dull in the villages he knows. As a budding scientist, he has to admit he doesn\u2019t know enough to make decisions like that.\nHe should probably ask the wisest person up here. \u201cWhat would happen if you were free and people would know everything that they once knew again?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t answer that. My knowledge of the state of the world isn\u2019t current. How many people are there? Is there any industrialization? Use of electricity, infrastructure?\u201d\n\u201cNot in the Rotte valley, no. We can\u2019t repair the roads like the olden day people did, but we have white power.\u201d\n\u201cWell, kid, we can\u2019t assume that the world is like your valley. So until there is a way of finding out\u2014say, releasing me\u2014we shouldn\u2019t act.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a we now. It makes Alois feel something new. It\u2019s not the same we he had with his fellow students, or his village, or say the chickens and the goats. It\u2019s a different we, powerful, mysterious, frightening. And it feels good, although he knows he should exercise caution with the Bridge. The Beast. Which of the two is it? Or is it both, like a human being, a mix of good and bad qualities?\n\u201cNo, I should escape and find out what\u2019s happening in the world. And if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll come back and release you.\u201d\nThe Bridge snorts. It makes Alois smile in spite of himself. He doesn\u2019t know how and where the thing produces sound, but it\u2019s just funny that a snort is in its repertoire.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way that you can find out what the world is like on foot. What are you thinking; you are going to write me letters?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t read?\u201d\n\u201cI can read letters, if someone is kind enough to hold them up for my cameras. Can you think of anyone who would?\u201d\nYeah, no. That\u2019s not going to happen if Alois\u2019 not around. Enough of this, time to move the goats or they\u2019ll start on his laundry. He turns away and starts back on the clingway.\n\u201cSee you,\u201d he says.\n\u201cHave a nice day,\u201d the Bridge answers.\n\u201cWhat is it you really want? All this fencing and dancing is making me crazy. Just tell me.\u201d\nAlois leans against the sun-warmed rock, gnawing on a goat cheese sandwich. It\u2019s his first batch of cheese, and he\u2019s feeling proud and happy.\nThe Bridge is silent. \u201cI want to be free. And I don\u2019t want to be alone anymore. I want to talk to someone like me again. It\u2019s not that you humans aren\u2019t interesting. Just very, very slow.\u201d\nThe Bridge must be so lonely. It is the last one of its kind. It\u2019s completely isolated. It has been for centuries. Which must feel much longer to it than to the humans imprisoning him, who\u2019ve even forgotten who and what it is.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what do next,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI sense an impasse. A standstill.\u201d\nExactly. Alois can\u2019t stand the feeling. He\u2019s been here almost two months, reading, feeding the chickens, picking up his food every week. It\u2019s already been too long. He wants his life back. And if that\u2019s not possible, which seems very likely, he wants a new life. As long as it\u2019s not here.\nThe elders have ignored his notes about his books. They can\u2019t have missed them all. Their silence must be deliberate. They have decided he doesn\u2019t need his anatomy and organic chemistry books.\nEven though he knows it\u2019s probably not wise, he wants to trust his new instinct. The one that says \u201cus.\u201d Two beings screwed over by their elders or someone, anyway, and that\u2019s what binds them together.\n\u201cOkay. I can talk to you for fifty more years and still not be sure what I had to do. Show me. What do I do to release you? And if I do that, you have to promise to help me escape and find a new place to live. I want to go back to university. A university. To learn. I want the old knowledge. Teach me how to make more things like you.\u201d\nThe Bridge laughs. The blue sky, framed by its chunky red x-es, seems brighter when it does that. \u201cI promise to help you escape. I promise to help you find a place to live and a university or school to go to. I will teach you how to make a start on making things like me. You understand that that is complicated? That we may have to start by creating electricity and light bulbs and steam machines? That it may take more than a lifetime?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe we should start a university,\u201d Alois says.\n\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d\n\u201cShow me how to release you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to walk to the end of me and jump off.\u201d\nAlois focuses his gaze away from dreaming about the blue sky and on the Bridge itself. Its walkway stretches out into that very blue sky, going up a bit, ending in nothing. Nobody in his right mind would approach that hacked-off end within a meter\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Is that how the others died? I can\u2019t do that!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s where they put the off-switch. They didn\u2019t intend to make it easy,\u201d the Bridge says.\nAlois hesitates on the brink of the Bridge, the red meters stretching out in front of him. \u201cCan I go look? And then return and think about it?\u201d\n\u201cNo. Walking across is part two of the unlocking sequence.\u201d\n\u201cAm I the first to try? Wait, part two?\u201d\n\u201cYou forgot to say the words, Alois. That was part one.\u201d\nAlois feels hot and cold at the same time. So he did. He feels bad about having forgotten, although he might have chosen to do it on purpose.\nHe wants to ignore his churning stomach and burning cheeks, and plows on. \u201cWill I be the first to try?\u201d\nThe Bridge is silent for a while. As if Alois cares he\u2019s the first and only. Well, okay, maybe a little bit.\n\u201cNo. Groom 5 went crazy and wanted to send us both to hell for our sins. I don\u2019t think he properly understood my nature, and I hadn\u2019t told him what to do after he dove off.\u201d\nAlois winces. The gorge at his feet stares at him hard, wanting him to think about all the bones lying at the bottom. \u201cI don\u2019t think I properly understand your nature, do I?\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have the educational background for it. But remember, we\u2019re going to change that.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nAnother silence.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking if I need to get stuff from the cabin.\u201d\nThe Bridge sighs. \u201cYeah, go on then.\u201d\nAlois scuttles back to the cabin, still not used enough to the narrow ledge for a full out run. What does he need? His spare clothes, his winter coats, food. It\u2019s not much, that\u2019s for sure. It\u2019ll last less than a week. He gathers all the eggs he can find and sets them to the boil. He kills a chicken. Another one. Packs his rucksack. Fills his belly with goat milk. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s all he can do. Wait, aren\u2019t there a few empty pages left in one of the notebooks? He takes those as well.\nHe\u2019s staggering under the weight of the rucksack when he comes back, and nearly ends up in the abyss because he overbalances. Thank god someone strung a rope along the ledge.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come back,\u201d the Bridge says.\n\u201cWhere else can I go?\u201d\n\u201cI really meant to say I\u2019m glad to see you.\u201d\nAlois shuffles his feet. He doesn\u2019t know what to answer. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t swing by my parents\u2019 house?\u201d\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t swing by anywhere you know anyone. Just wondering, what are you expecting me to look like after I\u2019m released? I don\u2019t need to look like a Bridge, but I\u2019m still not the kind of thing that fits in your pocket. I\u2019m going to be hella noticeable.\u201d\nAlois eyes the hundreds of thick, strong, crimson steel beams. \u201cYeah. I did guess that. Maybe we can paint you a less noticeable color?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to change that. It\u2019s just my mass I can\u2019t change, because it\u2019s related to my processing speed. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore, you\u2019ll find out soon enough. Come on!\u201d\nAlois admits to himself he\u2019s been postponing the moment he sets foot on the Bridge. To prove to himself that he dares, he sticks his often-repairs, clunky right boot onto the walkway. A vibration sweeps towards him. Is it his own chittering or is it anticipation?\nNow or never. Or maybe he can\u2019t go back now even if he dared.\nHe lifts his other foot and takes the first real step.\nThe Bridge is silent. Nothing much has changed yet, Alois\u2019 no more than a meter from the ledge and yet the wind seems to freshen, ruffling his hair. His heart beats a mile a minute.\nAs he steps forward, still hesitating, the wind buffets him straight in the face. He leans into it. The wind supports him so he won\u2019t stumble and fall. It\u2019s not important now that he\u2019s on the walkway, protected on each side by chest-high balustrades, but it gives him confidence for what will come next.\nSooner than Alois likes the end of the walkway comes into focus. It really is like the end of the Bridge is lopped off. Beyond the edge is only blue sky, with the occasional cloud luffing by.\nHis skin prickles all over and his mouth is dry.\nHe can\u2019t do this. The leap of faith is too great. He\u2019s only known the Bridge for half a summer!\nHis boots take him to the edge anyway. The wind dies away slowly so he has time to stand on his own two feet. How come the Bridge can talk and make wind and not free itself? He will ask it if he survives.\n\u201cNow?\u201d he asks. The tinny, small sound of his voice makes him more scared.\n\u201cNow.\u201d The Bridge\u2019s voice is soft but expresses no doubt.\nAlois steps.\nHe falls.\nAnd is caught by arms of air. He looks straight down into the abyss beneath his feet, seeing dirty ice, streams, broken trees, something that is maybe a skeleton. He doesn\u2019t want to know.\nHe turns, as the Bridge has told him, and presses his hands against the panel that is helpfully marked with a human palm. A great, rending sound.\nHe falls again.\nLonger this time. Long enough to start doubting, long enough to start imagining his limbs breaking against the gray ice below.\nAnd he is caught again, less gently, by a giant steel hand. His body is bruised, but his relief is so great he falls limp and almost bashes his head in against the square, hard middle finger.\n\u201cDoes it work? Are you free?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to ask?\u201d\nThe voice is changed. Alois blinks and takes in the new red shape against the sky, moving in giant strides across the glacier. The Bridge is now a giant drawn by a child, thick steel bars making up his more or less humanoid form.\nThe hand that holds him isn\u2019t particularly safe, with its big gaps between the bars, but he feels no fear.\nHe peers through the fingers to the horizon. So far, just glaciers and snowy mountaintops, vistas he\u2019s glimpsed from below all his life.\nSoon he will see lands he\u2019s never seen before. Maybe he\u2019s done the wrong thing, tumbled the world in new eras of chaos and misery. But at least he\u2019s set two beings free today. That\u2019s going to have to hold out against the reasonable doubts in his heart.\nHe lays back against his pack and starts singing. He doesn\u2019t look up but something tells him the faceless giant overhead is smiling.\nBo Balder lives and works close to Amsterdam.

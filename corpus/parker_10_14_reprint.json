A cart, tied up to a hitching-post. One thin horse. Not so very long ago, he\u2019d used the cart for shifting dung. I sat next to him, my bag on my knees, tucking my feet in close, and laid a bet with myself as to what he\u2019d say next.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a wizard,\u201d he said.\n I owed myself two nomismata. \u201cI\u2019m not a wizard,\u201d I said.\n I always say that.\n \u201cBut we sent to the Fathers for a\u2014\u201d\n \u201dI\u2019m not a wizard,\u201d I repeated, \u201cI\u2019m a philosopher. There\u2019s no such thing as wizards.\u201d\n He frowned. \u201cWe sent to the Fathers for a wizard,\u201d he said.\n I have this little speech. I can say it with my eyes shut, or thinking about something else. It comes out better if I\u2019m not thinking about what I\u2019m saying. I tell them, we\u2019re not wizards, we don\u2019t do magic, there\u2019s no such thing as magic. Rather, we\u2019re students of natural philosophy, specializing in mental energies, telepathy, telekinesis, indirect vision. Not magic; just science where we haven\u2019t quite figured out how it works yet. I looked at him. His hood and coat were homespun, that open, rather scratchy weave you get with moorland wool. The patches were a slightly different color; I guessed they\u2019d been salvaged from an even older coat that had finally reached the point where there was nothing left to sew onto. The boots had a military look. There had been battles in these parts, thirty years ago, in the civil war. The boots looked to be about that sort of vintage. Waste not, want not.\n \u201cI\u2019m kidding,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m a wizard.\u201d\n He looked at me, then back at the road. I hadn\u2019t risen in his estimation, but I hadn\u2019t sunk any lower, probably because that wasn\u2019t possible. I waited for him to broach the subject.\n By my estimation, three miles out of town; I said; \u201cSo, tell me what\u2019s been happening.\u201d\n He had big hands; too big for his wrists, which looked like bones painted color \u201cThe Brother wrote you a letter,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYes,\u201d I replied brightly. \u201cBut I want you to tell me.\u201d\n The silence that followed was thought rather than rudeness or sulking. Then he said, \u201cNo good asking me. I don\u2019t know about that stuff.\u201d\n They never want to talk to me. I have to conclude that it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ve tried all sorts of different approaches. I\u2019ve tried being friendly, which gets you nowhere. I\u2019ve tried keeping my face shut until someone volunteers information, which gets you peace and quiet. I\u2019ve read books about agriculture, so I can talk intelligently about the state of the crops, milk yields, prices at market and the weather. When I do that, of course, I end up talking to myself. Actually, I have no problem about talking to myself. In the country, it\u2019s the only way I ever get an intelligent conversation.\n \u201cThe dead man,\u201d I prompted him. I never say the deceased.\n He shrugged. \u201cDied about three months ago. Never had any bother till just after lambing.\u201d\n \u201cI see. And then?\u201d\n \u201cIt was sheep to begin with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old ram, with its neck broke, and then four ewes. They all reckoned it was wolves, but I said to them, wolves don\u2019t break necks, it was something with hands did that.\u201d\n I nodded. I knew all this. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n \u201cMore sheep,\u201d he said, \u201cand the dog, and then an old man, used to go round all the farms selling stuff, buttons and needles and things he made out of old bones; and when we found him, we reckoned we\u2019d best tell the boss up at the grange, and he sent down two of his men to look out at night, and then the same thing happened to them. I said, that\u2019s no wolf. Knew all along, see. Seen it before.\u201d\n That hadn\u2019t been in the letter. \u201cIs that right?\u201d I said.\n \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d the man said (and now I knew the problem would be getting him to shut up.) \u201cSame thing exactly; sheep, then travelers, then three of the duke\u2019s men. My granddad, he knew what it was, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. He knew a lot of stuff, granddad.\u201d\n \u201cWhat happened?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cHim and me and my cousin from out over, we got a couple of shovels and a pick and an axe, and we went and dug up this old boy who\u2019d died. And he was all swelled up, like he\u2019d got the gout all over, and he was purple, like a grape. So we cut off his head and shoveled all the dirt back, and we dropped the head down an old well, and that was the end of that. No more bother. Didn\u2019t say what we\u2019d done, mind. The Brother wouldn\u2019t have liked it. Funny bugger, he was.\u201d\n Well, I thought. \u201cYou did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cYour grandfather was a clever man, obviously.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knew a lot of stuff.\u201d\n I was doing my mental arithmetic. When I was a kid; so, anything from fifty-five to sixty years ago. Rather a long interval, but not unheard of. I was about to ask if anything like it had happened before then, but I figured it out just in time. If wise old Grandfather had known exactly what to do, it stood to reason he\u2019d learned it the old-fashioned way, watching or helping; quite possibly more than once.\n \u201cThe man who died,\u201d I said.\n \u201cHim.\u201d A cartload of significance crammed into that word. \u201cOffcomer,\u201d he explained.\n \u201cAh,\u201d I said.\n \u201cSchoolteacher, he called himself,\u201d he went on. \u201cDunno about that. Him and the Brother, they tried to get a school going, to teach the boys their letters and figuring and all, but I told them, waste of time in these parts, you can\u2019t spare a boy in summer, and winter, it\u2019s too dark and cold to be walking five miles there and five miles back, just to learn stuff out of a book. And they wanted paying, two pence twice a year. People round here can\u2019t afford that for a parcel of old nonsense.\u201d\n I thought of my own childhood, and said nothing. \u201cWhere did he come from?\u201d\n \u201cDown south.\u201d Well, of course he did. \u201cI said to him, you\u2019re a long way from home. He didn\u2019t deny it. Said it was his calling, whatever that\u2019s supposed to mean.\u201d\n It was dark by the time we reached the farm. It was exactly what I\u2019d been expecting; long and low, with turf eaves a foot off the ground, turf walls over a light timber frame. No trees this high up, so lumber had to come up the coast on a big shallow-draught freighter as far as Holy Trinity, then road haulage the rest of the way. I spent the first fifteen years of my life sleeping under turf, and I still get nightmares.\n Mercifully, the Brother was there waiting for me. He was younger than I\u2019d anticipated\u2014you always think of village Brothers as craggy old fat men, or thin and brittle, like dried twigs with papery bark. Brother Stauracius couldn\u2019t have been much over thirty; a tall, broad-shouldered man with an almost perfectly square head, hair cropped short like winter pasture and pale blue eyes. Even without the habit, nobody could have taken him for a farmer.\n \u201cI\u2019m so glad you could come,\u201d he said, town voice, educated, rather high for such a big man. He sounded like he meant it. \u201cSuch a very long way. I hope the journey wasn\u2019t too dreadful.\u201d\n I wondered what he\u2019d done wrong, to have ended up here. \u201cThank you for your letter,\u201d I said.\n He nodded, genuinely pleased. \u201cI was worried, I didn\u2019t know what to put in and leave out. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve had no experience with this sort of thing, none at all. I\u2019m sure there must be a great deal more you need to know.\u201d\n I shook my head. \u201cIt sounds like a textbook case,\u201d I said.\n \u201cReally.\u201d He nodded several times, quickly. \u201cI looked it up in Statutes and Procedures, naturally, but the information was very sparse, very sparse indeed. Well, of course. Obviously, this sort of thing has to be left to the experts. Further detail would only encourage the ignorant to meddle.\u201d\n I thought about Grandfather; two shovels and an axe, job done. But not quite, or else I wouldn\u2019t be here. \u201cQuite,\u201d I said. \u201cNow, you\u2019re sure there were no other deaths within six months of the first attack.\u201d\n \u201cQuite sure,\u201d he said, as though his life depended on it. \u201cNobody but poor Anthemius.\u201d\n Nobody had asked me to sit down, let alone take my wet boots off. The hell with it. I sat down on the end of a bench. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say what he died of.\u201d\n \u201cExposure.\u201d Brother Stauracius looked very sad. \u201cHe was caught out in a snowstorm and froze to death, poor man.\u201d\n \u201cNear here?\u201d\n \u201cActually, no.\u201d A slight frown, like a crack in a wall. \u201cWe found him about two miles from here, as it happens, on the big pasture between the mountains and the river. A long way from anywhere, so presumably he lost his way in the snow and wandered about aimlessly until the cold got to him.\u201d\n I thought about that. \u201cOn his way back home, then.\u201d\n \u201cI suppose so, yes.\u201d\n I needed a map. You almost always need a map, and there never is one. If ever I\u2019m Emperor, I\u2019ll have the entire country surveyed and mapped, and copies of each parish hung up in the temple vestries. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it matters,\u201d I lied. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me to see the grave.\u201d\n A faint glow of alarm in those watered-down eyes. \u201cIn the morning.\u201d\n \u201cOf course in the morning,\u201d I said.\n He relaxed just a little. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay here tonight, of course. I\u2019m afraid the arrangements are a bit\u2014\u201d\n \u201dI was brought up on a farm,\u201d I said.\n Unlike him. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, then,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I suppose we should join our hosts. The evening meal is served rather early in these parts.\u201d\n \u201cGood,\u201d I said.\n Sleeping under turf is like being in your grave. Of course, there\u2019s rafters. That\u2019s what you see when you look up, lying wide awake in the dark. Your eyes get the hang of it quite soon, diluting the black into gray into a palette of pale grays; you see rafters, not the underside of turf. And the smoke hardens it off, so it doesn\u2019t crumble. You don\u2019t get worms dropping on your face. But it\u2019s unavoidable, no matter how long you do it, no matter how used you are to it. You lie there, and the thought crosses your mind as you stare at the underside of grass; is this what it\u2019ll be like?\n The answer is, of course, no. First, the roof will be considerably lower; it\u2019ll be the lid of a box, if you\u2019re lucky enough to have one, or else no roof at all, just dirt chucked on your face. Second, you won\u2019t be able to see it because you\u2019ll be dead.\n But you can\u2019t help wondering. For a start, there\u2019s temperature. Turf is a wonderful insulator; keeps out the cold in winter and the heat in summer. What it doesn\u2019t keep out is the damp. It occurs to you as you lie on your back there; so long as they bury me in a thick shirt, won\u2019t have to worry about being cold, or too hot in summer, but the damp could be a problem. Gets into your bones. A man could catch his death.\n It\u2019s while you\u2019re lying there\u2014everybody else is fast asleep; no imagination, no curiosity, or they\u2019ve been working so hard all day they just sleep, no matter what\u2014that you start hearing the noises. Actually, turf\u2019s pretty quiet. Doesn\u2019t creak like wood, gradually settling, and you don\u2019t get drips from leaks. What you get is the thumping noises over your head. Clump, clump, clump, then a pause, then clump, clump, clump.\n They tell you, when you\u2019re a kid and you ask, that it\u2019s the sound of dead men riding the roof-tree. They tell you that dead men get up out of the ground, climb up on the roof, sit astride the peak and jiggle about, walloping their heels into the turf like a man kicking on a horse. You believe them; I never was quite sure whether they believed it themselves. When you\u2019re older, of course, and you\u2019ve left the farm and gone somewhere civilized, where it doesn\u2019t happen, you finally figure it out; what you hear is sheep, hopping up onto the roof in the night, wandering about grazing the fine sweet grass that grows there, picking out the wild leeks, of which they\u2019re particularly fond. Sheep, for crying out loud, not dead men at all. I guess they knew really, all along, and the stuff about dead men was to keep you indoors at night, keep you from wandering out under the stars (though why you should want to I couldn\u2019t begin to imagine). Or at least, at some point, way back in the dim past, some smartarse with a particularly warped imagination made up the story about dead men, to scare his kids; and the kids believed, and never figured it was sheep, and they told their kids, and so on down the generations. Maybe you never figure it out unless you leave the farm, which nobody ever does, except me.\n As a matter of fact, I was just beginning to drift off into a doze when the thumping started. Clump, clump, clump; pause; clump, clump, clump. I was not amused. I was bone tired and I really wanted to get some sleep, and here were these fucking sheep walking about over my head. The hell with that, I thought, and got up.\n I opened the door as quietly as I could, not wanting to wake up the household, and I stood in the doorway for a little while, letting my eyes get used to the dark. Someone had left a stick leaning against the doorframe. I picked it up, on the off chance that there might be a sheep close enough to hit.\n Something was moving about again. I walked away from the house until I could see up top.\n It wasn\u2019t sheep. It was a dead man.\n He was sitting astride the roof, his legs drooping down either side, like a farmer on his way back from market. His hands were on his hips and he was looking away to the east. He was just a dark shape against the sky, but there was something about the way he sat there; peaceful. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d seen me, and I felt no great inclination to advertise my presence. If I say I wasn\u2019t scared, I wouldn\u2019t expect to be believed: but fear wasn\u2019t uppermost in my mind. Mostly, I was interested.\n No idea how long I stood and he sat. It occurred to me that I was just assuming he was a dead man. Looked at logically, far more likely that he was alive, and had reasons of his own for climbing up on a roof in the middle of the night. Well; there\u2019s a time and a place for logic.\n He turned his head, looking down the line of the roof-tree, and lifted his heels, and dug them into the turf three times; clump, clump, clump. (And at that point, I realized the flaw in my earlier rationalization. Three clumps; always three, ever since I was a kid. How many three-legged sheep do you see?) At that moment, the moon came out from behind the clouds, and suddenly we were looking at each other; me and him.\n My host had been right; he was purple, like a grape. Or a bruise; the whole body one enormous bruise. Swollen, he\u2019d said; either that, or he was an enormous man, arms and legs twice as thick as normal. His eyes were white; no pupils.\n \u201cHello,\u201d I said.\n He leaned forward just a little and cupped his hand behind his left ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to speak up,\u201d he said.\n Words from a dead man; a purple, swollen man sitting astride a roof. \u201cTell me,\u201d I said, raising my voice. \u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d\n He looked at me, or a little bit past me. I couldn\u2019t tell if his mouth moved, but there was a deep, gurgling noise which could only have been laughter. \u201cDo what?\u201d\n \u201cRide on the roof like it\u2019s a horse,\u201d I said.\n His shoulders lifted; a slow, exaggerated shrug, like he didn\u2019t know what a shrug was, but was copying one he\u2019d seen many years ago. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel the urge to do it, so I do it.\u201d\n Well, I thought. One of the great abiding mysteries of my childhood not quite cleared up. \u201cAre you Anthemius?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe schoolmaster?\u201d\n Again the laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question,\u201d he said. \u201cTell you what,\u201d he went on, \u201ccome up here and sit with me, so we can talk without yelling.\u201d\n In the moonlight I could make out the huge hands, with their monstrous overripe fingers. How tight the skin would have to be, with all that pressure against it from the inside. Breaking a neck would be like snapping a pear off a tree.\n \u201cLet me rephrase that,\u201d I said. \u201cWere you Anthemius? When you were\u2014\u201d\n \u201dYes,\u201d he said, speaking quickly to cut off a word he didn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cI think I was. Thank you,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to remember. It\u2019s been on the tip of my tongue, but somehow I can\u2019t seem to think of any names.\u201d\n The approved procedure for coping with the restless dead is, essentially, what Grandfather did; though of course we make rather more of a fuss about it. The approved procedure should, of course, be carried out in daylight; noon is recommended. Should you chance to encounter a specimen during the night, there are two courses of action, both recommended rather than approved. One, you draw your sword and cut its head off. Two, you challenge it to the riddle-game and keep it talking all night, until dawn comes up unexpectedly and strands it like a beached whale in the cruel light.\n Commentary on that. I am not a man of action. I don\u2019t vault onto roofs, I don\u2019t carry weapons. One of the reasons I left the farm in the first place was, I have trouble lifting even moderate loads. So much for option one; and as for option two\u2014\n Also, I was curious. Interested.\n \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really not sure,\u201d he replied; and the voice was starting to sound like a man\u2019s voice, my ears were getting the hang of it, the way my eyes had got used to the dark. \u201cI know I was out in the snow and I\u2019d lost my way. I got terribly cold, so that every bit of me hurt. Then the pain started to ease up, and I sort of fell asleep.\u201d\n \u201cYou died,\u201d I said.\n He didn\u2019t like me saying that, but I guess he forgave me. \u201cI remember waking up,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was pitch dark and terribly quiet, and I couldn\u2019t move. I was very scared. And then it occurred to me, I wasn\u2019t breathing. I don\u2019t mean I was holding my breath. I wasn\u2019t breathing at all, and it didn\u2019t matter. So then I knew.\u201d\n I waited; but I hadn\u2019t got all night. \u201cAnd then?\u201d\n He turned his head away. No hair, just a bulging purple scalp. A head like a plum. \u201cI was terrified,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I had no way of knowing.\u201d He paused, and I have no idea what was passing through his mind. \u201cAfter a long time, I found I could move after all. I got my hands up against the lid, and I pushed, and I could feel the wood burst apart. That scared me even more, I thought the roof, I mean all the earth on top of me, I thought it\u2019d cave in and bury me.\u201d He paused again. \u201cI was always frightened of tight places,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n I nodded. Me too, as it happens.\n \u201cI guess I panicked,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause I kept pushing, and I somehow knew that I was incredibly strong, much stronger than I\u2019d ever been before, so I thought, if I push hard enough. I wasn\u2019t thinking straight, of course.\u201d\n \u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cPushed right up through the dirt and into the moonlight,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazing feeling. The first thing I wanted to do was run to the nearest farm and tell them, Look, I\u2019m not dead after all.\u201d He stopped; he\u2019d said the word without thinking. \u201cBut then I thought about it; and I still wasn\u2019t breathing, and I couldn\u2019t actually feel anything. I could move my hands and feet, I could stand upright and balance, all that, but\u2014you know when you\u2019ve been sitting a long time and your feet go numb. It was like that, all over. It felt so strange.\u201d\n \u201cGo on,\u201d I said.\n He didn\u2019t, not for a long time. \u201cI think I sat down,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019d have done that, standing up didn\u2019t make me tired or anything. I don\u2019t feel tired, ever. But I was so confused, I didn\u2019t know what I was supposed to do. It all felt wrong.\u201d He lifted his heels slowly and let them drop; clump, clump, clump. \u201cAnd while I was there the sun started to come up, and the light just sort of flooded into my head and bleached everything away, so I couldn\u2019t think at all. I guess you could say I passed out. Anyway, when I opened my eyes I was back where I\u2019d started from, lying in the dark.\u201d\n I frowned. \u201cHow did you get back there?\u201d\n \u201cI just don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cStill don\u2019t. It always happens, that\u2019s all I know. When the sun comes up, my mind washes away. If I\u2019ve gone any distance, I know I have to get back. I run. I can run really fast. I know I\u2019ve got to be back\u2014home,\u201d he said, with a sort of breaking-up laugh, \u201cbefore the sun comes up. I\u2019ve learned to be careful, to give myself plenty of time.\u201d\n He was still and quiet for a while. I asked, \u201cWhy do you kill things?\u201d\n \u201cNo idea.\u201d He sounded distressed. \u201cIf something comes close enough, I grab it and twist it till it\u2019s dead. Like a cat lashing out at a bit of string. Reflex. I just know it\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cDo you go looking\u2014?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d He mumbled the word, like a kid admitting a crime. \u201cYes, I do. I do my best to keep away from where there might be people. It\u2019s all the same to me; sheep, foxes, men. I\u2019d go a long way away, into the mountains, if I could. But I have to stay close, so I can get back in time.\u201d\n I\u2019d been debating with myself, and I knew I had to ask. \u201cWhat were you?\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n He didn\u2019t answer. I repeated the question.\n \u201cLike you said,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was a schoolteacher.\u201d\n \u201cBefore that.\u201d\n When he answered, it was against his will. The words came out slow, flat; he spoke because he had to. \u201cI was a Brother,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was thirty, they said I should apply to the Order, they thought I had the gift, and the brains, and the application and the self-discipline. I passed the exam and I was at the Studium for five years. Like you,\u201d he added.\n I let that go. \u201cYou joined the Order.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d The flat voice had gone; there was a flare of anger. \u201cNo, I failed matriculation. I retook it the next year, but I failed again. They sent me back to my parish, but by then they\u2019d got someone else. So I ended up wandering about, looking for teaching work, letter-writing, anything I could do to earn a living. There\u2019s not a lot you can do, of course.\u201d\n Suddenly I felt bitter cold, right through. Took me a moment to realize it was fear. \u201cSo you came here,\u201d I said, just to keep him talking.\n \u201cEventually. A lot of other places first, but here\u2019s where I ended up.\u201d He lifted his head abruptly. \u201cThey sent you here to deal with me, am I right?\u201d\n I didn\u2019t reply.\n \u201cOf course they did,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m a nuisance, a pest, a menace to agriculture. You came here to dig me up and cut my head off.\u201d\n This time, I was the one who had to speak against my will. \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t let you do that. It\u2019s my\u2014\u201d\n He\u2019d been about to say life. Presumably he tried to find another way of phrasing it, then gave up. We both knew what he meant.\n \u201cYou passed the exams, then,\u201d he said.\n \u201cBarely,\u201d I replied. \u201cTwo hundred seventh out of two hundred twenty.\u201d\n \u201cWhich is why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n His white eyes in the ash-white moonlight. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give out research posts if you come two hundred seventh.\u201d\n He nodded gravely. \u201cCommercial work,\u201d he said.\n \u201cWhen I can get it,\u201d I replied. \u201cWhich isn\u2019t often. Others far more qualified than me.\u201d\n He grunted. It could have been sympathy. \u201cPublic service work.\u201d\n \u201cAfraid so,\u201d I replied.\n \u201cWhich is why you\u2019re here.\u201d He lifted his head and rolled it round on his shoulders, like someone waking up after sleeping in a chair. \u201cBecause\u2014well, because you aren\u2019t much good. Well?\u201d\n I resented that, even though it was true. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not good,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that everyone in my year was better than me.\u201d\n \u201cOf course.\u201d He leaned forward, his hands braced on his knees. \u201cThe question is,\u201d he said, \u201cdo I still have the gift, after what happened to me. If I\u2019ve still got it, your job is going to be difficult.\u201d\n \u201cIf not,\u201d I said.\n \u201cWell,\u201d he replied, \u201cI suppose we\u2019re about to find out.\u201d\n \u201cIndeed,\u201d I said. \u201cThere could be a paper for the journals in this.\u201d\n \u201cYour chance to escape from obscurity,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cUnder different circumstances, I\u2019d wish you well. Unfortunately, I really don\u2019t want you cutting off my head. It\u2019s a miserable existence, but\u2014\u201d\n I could see his point. His voice was quite human now; if I\u2019d known him before, I\u2019d have recognized him. He had his back to the moon, so I couldn\u2019t see the features of his face.\n \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is, you don\u2019t have to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cGo away. Go home. Nobody knows you came out here tonight. I promise I\u2019ll stay away until you\u2019ve gone. If I don\u2019t show up, you can report that there was no direct evidence of an infestation, and therefore you didn\u2019t feel justified in desecrating what was probably an innocent grave.\u201d\n \u201cBut you\u2019ll be back,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYes, and no doubt they\u2019ll send someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be you.\u201d\n I was tempted. Of course I was tempted. For one thing, he was a rational creature; with my eyes shut, if I hadn\u2019t known better, I\u2019d have said he was a natural man with a heavy cold. And what if the gift did survive death? He\u2019d kill me. I had to admit it to myself; the thought that I could get killed doing this job hadn\u2019t occurred to me. I\u2019d anticipated a quick, grisly hour\u2019s work in broad daylight; no risk.\n I\u2019m not a coward, but I appreciate the value of fear, the way I appreciate the value of money. I\u2019m most definitely not brave.\n I saw something in the moonlight, and said (trying not to talk quickly or raise my voice); \u201cI could go back to bed, and then come back in the morning and dig you up.\u201d\n \u201cYou could,\u201d he said.\n \u201cYou don\u2019t think I would.\u201d\n \u201cNot if we\u2019d made an agreement.\u201d\n \u201cYou could be right,\u201d I said. \u201cBut what about the farmers? You\u2019ve got to admit\u2014\u201d\n At which moment, the Brother (who\u2019d come out of the back door, crawled up on the roof behind him and edged down the roof-tree towards him until he was close enough to reach his neck with the axe he\u2019d brought with him) raised his arms high and swung. No sound at all; but at the last moment, the dead man leaned his head to one side, just enough, and the axe blade swept past, cutting air. I heard the Brother grunt, shocked and panicky; I saw the dead man\u2014eyes still fixed on me\u2014reach behind him with his left hand and catch the swinging axe just below the head, and hold it perfectly still. The Brother gasped, but didn\u2019t let go; he was pulling with all his strength, like a little dog tugging on a belt. All his efforts couldn\u2019t move the dead man\u2019s arm the thickness of a fingernail.\n \u201cNow,\u201d the dead man said. \u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d\n The delay on my part was unforgivable, completely unprofessional. I knew I had to do something, but my mind had gone completely blank. I couldn\u2019t remember any procedures, let alone any words. Think, a tiny voice was yelling inside me head, but I couldn\u2019t. I heard the Brother whimper, as he applied every scrap of strength in a tendon-ripping, joint-tearing last desperate jerk on the axe handle that had no effect whatsoever. The dead man was looking straight at me. His lips began to move.\n Pro nobis peccatoribus; not the obvious choice, not even on the same page of the book, but it was the only procedure I could think of. Unfortunately, it\u2019s one I\u2019ve always had real difficulties with. You reach out with your hand that is not a hand, extend the fingers that aren\u2019t fingers; I\u2019m all right as far as that, and then I tend to come unstuck.\n (What I was thinking was: So he failed the exam, and I passed. Yes, but maybe the reason he failed was, he didn\u2019t read the questions through properly, or he spent so long on Part 1 that he didn\u2019t leave himself enough time for two and three. Maybe he\u2019s really good, just unlucky in exams.)\n I was mumbling; Sol invicte, ora pro nobis peccatoribus in die periculi. Of course, there\u2019s a school of thought that says the magic words have no real effect whatsoever, they\u2019re just a way of concentrating the mind. I tend to agree. Why should an archaic prayer in a dead language to a god nobody\u2019s believed in for six hundred years have any effect on anything at all? Ora pro nobis peccatoribus, I repeated urgently, nobis peccatoribus in die periculi.\n It worked, It can\u2019t have been the words, of course, but it felt like it was the words. I was in, I was through. I was inside his head.\n There was nothing there.\n Believe me, it\u2019s true. Nothing at all; like walking into a house where someone\u2019s died, and the family have been in and cleared out all the furniture. Nothing there, because I was inside the head of a dead man; albeit a dead man who was looking at me reproachfully out of blank white eyes while holding an axe absolutely still.\n Fine; all the easier, if it\u2019s empty. I looked for the controls. You have to visualize them, of course. I see them as the handwheels of a lathe. It\u2019s because I had a holiday job in a foundry in Second Year. I don\u2019t know how to use a lathe. What I mostly did was sweep up piles of swarf off the floor.\n Here is the handwheel that controls the arms. I reached out with the hand that is not a hand, grabbed it and tried to turn it. Stuck. I tried harder. Stuck. I tried really hard, and the bloody thing came away in my hand.\n It\u2019s not supposed to do that.\n I re-visualized. I saw the controls as the reins of a cart, the footbrake under my boot that was not a boot. I stamped on the brake and hauled back hard on the reins.\n I haven\u2019t got round to writing that paper for the journals, so here it is for the first time anywhere. The gift does not survive death. Nothing survives. The room was empty. And the handwheel only broke off because I\u2019m clumsy and cack-handed, the sort of person who trips over cats and breaks the nibs of pens by pressing too hard.\n I heard the Brother gasp, as he jerked the axe out of the dead man\u2019s grip. The dead man didn\u2019t move. His eyes were still fixed on mine, right up to the moment when the axe shore through his neck and his head wobbled and fell, bounced off his knee and tumbled off the roof into the short grass below. The body didn\u2019t move.\n I know why. It took ten of us, with an improvised crane made of twelve-foot three-inch fir poles, to get the body down off the roof. It must\u2019ve weighed half a ton. The head alone was two hundredweight. Two men couldn\u2019t lift it; they had to use levers to roll it along the ground. There was no blood, but the neck started to ooze a milky white juice that smelt worse than anything you could possibly imagine.\n We burned the body. We drenched it in pine-pitch, and it caught quite easily and burnt down to nothing; not even any recognizable bits of bone. The white juice flared up like oil. They rolled the head over to the slurry-pond and pitched it in. It went down with a gurgle and a burp.\n \u201cI heard you talking to it,\u201d the Brother told me. For some reason, the word it offended me. \u201cI guessed you were using a variation on the riddle game, to keep it distracted till the sun came up.\u201d\n \u201cSomething like that,\u201d I said.\n He nodded. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have interfered, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had the situation under control, and I could have ruined everything.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d I said.\n He smiled; as if to say, it wasn\u2019t all right, but thanks for forgiving me. \u201cI guess I panicked,\u201d he said. Then he frowned. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I saw a chance of getting in on the act. It was stupid and selfish of me. You\u2019ll have to write to the prebendary.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t see why,\u201d I said mildly. \u201cThe way I see it, your actions were open to several different interpretations. I choose to interpret them as courage and resourcefulness. I could put that in a letter, if you like.\u201d\n \u201cWould you?\u201d In his face, I saw all the desperation and cruelty of sudden, unexpected hope. \u201cI mean, seriously?\u201d\n \u201cOf course,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThat\u2019d be\u2014\u201d He stopped. He couldn\u2019t think of a big enough word. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea what it\u2019s like,\u201d he said; all in a rush, like diarrhea. \u201cBeing stuck here, in this miserable place with these appalling people. If I can\u2019t get back to a town, I swear I\u2019ll go mad. And it\u2019s so cold in winter. I hate the cold.\u201d\n You can sleep in the coach, Father Prior said, when I tried to make a fuss about the timetable. I didn\u2019t say to him; have you ever been on a provincial mailcoach, on country roads, at this time of year? A dead man couldn\u2019t sleep on a mailcoach.\n I slept, nearly all the way; on account, I guess, of not having had much sleep the night before. Woke up just as we were crossing the Fulvens bridge; I looked out of the window, and all I could see was water, moonlight reflected on water. Couldn\u2019t get back to sleep after that. Too dark to read the case notes, which I\u2019d neglected to do back at the farm. But I remembered the basic facts from the briefing. These jobs are all the same, anyhow. Piece of cake.\n The coach threw me out just after dawn, at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere. Somewhere up on the moors; I\u2019m a valley boy myself. We had cousins up on the moor. I hated it when they came to visit. The old man was deaf as a post, and the three boys (mid to late thirties, but they were always the boys) just sat there, not saying a word. The mother died young, and I can\u2019t say I blame her.\n They were supposed to be meeting the coach, but there was no one there. I stood for a while, then I sat on my bag, then I sat on the ground, which was damp. I heard an owl, and a fox, or at least I hope it was a fox. If not, it was something we never got around to covering in Third Year, and I\u2019m very glad I didn\u2019t see it.\n They arrived eventually, in a little dog-cart thing; an old man driving, a younger man and the Brother. One small pony, furry like a bear.\n The Brother did the talking, for which I was quite grateful. He was one of the better sort of country Brothers; short man, somewhere between fifty and sixty, a distinct burr to his voice but he spoke clearly and used proper words. The boy was the younger man\u2019s son, the older man\u2019s grandson. He\u2019d been fooling about in a big oak tree, slipped, fell; broken arm and a hideous bash on the head. He hadn\u2019t come round, and it had been a week now. They had to prise his mouth open with the back of a horn spoon to get food and water in; he swallowed all right, but that was all he did. You could stick a needle in his foot half an inch and he wouldn\u2019t even twitch. The swelling on the back of his head had gone down\u2014the Brother disclaimed any medical knowledge, but he was lying\u2014and they\u2019d set the arm and splinted it, for what that was worth.\n I thought; better than killing the restless dead. One of my best subjects at the Studium, though of course we did all our practicals on conscious minds, with a Father sitting a few feet away, watching like a hawk. I\u2019d done one about eighteen months earlier, and it went off just fine; in, found her, straight out again. She followed me like a dog. I\u2019d been relieved when Father Prior told me; it could\u2019ve been something awkward and fiddly, like auspices, or horrible and scary, like a possession. Just in case, I\u2019d brought the book. I\u2019d meant to mug up the relevant chapter, either at the farm or on the coach, but I hadn\u2019t got round to it. Anyway, it had to be better than that empty place.\n It was quite a big house, for a hill-farm; sitting in the well of a valley, with a dense copper-beech hedge on all four sides, as a windbrake. Just the five of them in the house, the Brother said; grandfather, father, mother, the boy and a hired man who slept in the hayloft. The boy was nine years old. The Brother told me his name, but I\u2019m hopeless with names.\n They asked me, did I want to rest after the journey; wash and brush up, something to eat? The correct answer was, of course, No, so I gave it.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in here,\u201d the Brother said.\n Big for a hill-farm, but still oppressively small. Downstairs, the big kitchen, with a huge table, fireplace, two hams swinging like dead men on gibbets. A parlor, tiny and dusty and cold. Dairy, scullery, store; doorway through to the cowstalls. Upstairs, one big room and a sort of oversized cupboard, where the boy was. I could just about kneel beside the bed, if I didn\u2019t mind the window-sill digging in the small of my back.\n The hell with that, I thought; I\u2019m a qualified man, a professional, a Father; a wizard. I shouldn\u2019t have to work in conditions you wouldn\u2019t keep pigs in. \u201cTake him downstairs,\u201d I said. \u201cPut him on the kitchen table.\u201d\n They had a job. The stairs in that house were like a bell-tower, tightly coiled and cramped. Father and grandfather did the heavy lifting, while I watched. It\u2019s an odd thing about me. Sometimes, the more compassion is called for, the less capable I am of feeling it. I offer no explanation or excuse.\n \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have been moved,\u201d the Brother hissed in my ear, just loud enough so that everyone could hear. \u201cIn his condition\u2014\u201d\n \u201dYes, thank you,\u201d I said, in my best arrogant-city-bastard voice. I couldn\u2019t say why I was behaving like this. Sometimes I do. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll all stay well back, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d\n I looked at the boy, and I could remember the theory perfectly, every last detail, every last lecture note. His eyes were closed; he had a stupid face, fat girly lips, fat cheeks. If he lived, he\u2019d grow up tall, solid, double-chinned, gormless; the son of the farm. Pork fat and home-brewed beer; he\u2019d be spherical by the time he was forty, strong enough to wrestle a bullock to its knees, slow and tireless, infuriatingly calm, a man of few words; respected at market, shrewd and fat, his bald patch hidden under a hat that would never come off, probably not even in bed. A solid, productive life, which it was my duty to save. Lucky me.\n Theory; theory is your lifeline, they used to tell me, your driftwood in a shipwreck. I reminded myself of the basic propositions.\n To recover a lost mind, first make an entrance. This is usually done by visualizing yourself as a penetrating object; a drill bit, a woodpecker\u2019s beak, a maggot. The drill bit works for me, though for some reason I tend to be a carpenter\u2019s auger, wound in with a brace. I go in through the spiral flakes of waste bone thrown clear by the wide grooves of the cutter. I assume it\u2019s from some childhood memory, watching Granddad at work in the barn. You\u2019re not really supposed to use personal memories, but it\u2019s easier, for someone with my limited imagination.\n Once you\u2019re in; first ward, immediately, because you never know what might be waiting for you in there. I raised first ward as soon as I felt myself go through. I use scutum fidei, visualize a shield. Mine\u2019s round, with a hole in it at twelve o\u2019clock so I can see what\u2019s going on.\n I peered through the hole. No nasty creatures with dripping fangs crouched to pounce, which was nice. Count to ten and lower the shield slowly.\n I looked around. This is the crucial bit, and you mustn\u2019t rush. How long it takes depends on the strength of your gift, so naturally I take ages. The light gradually increases. First things first; get your bearings. Orientate yourself, taking special care to get a fix on the point you came in by. Well, obviously. If you lose your entry-point, you\u2019re stuck; in someone else\u2019s head forever. You really don\u2019t want that.\n I lined up on the corners of a ceiling, drawing diagonal lines and fixing on their point of origin, measuring the angles with my imaginary protractor (it\u2019s brass, with numbers in gothic-italic) One-oh-five, seventy-five; repeat the numbers four times out loud, to make sure they\u2019re loaded into memory. Fine. Now I know where I am and how to get out again. One-oh-five, seventy-five. Now, then. Let the dog see the rabbit.\n I was in a room. It\u2019s nearly always an interior; with kids, practically guaranteed it\u2019s their bedroom, or the room they sleep in, depending on social class and domestic arrangements. In all relevant essentials, it was the room upstairs I had him carried down from. Excellent; nice and small, not many places to hide anything. So much easier when you\u2019re dealing with a subject of limited intelligence.\n I visualized a body for myself. I tend not to be me. With children, it\u2019s usually best to be a nice lady; the kid\u2019s mother, if possible. I\u2019m not good enough to do specific people, and I have real problems being women. So I was a nice old man instead.\n Hello, I said. Where are you?\n Don\u2019t worry if they don\u2019t answer. Sometimes, they do, sometimes they don\u2019t. I walked round the bed, knelt down, looked under it. There was a cupboard; one of those triangular jobs, wedged in a corner. I opened that. For some reason, it was full of the skins and bones of dead animals. None of my business; I closed it. I pulled the covers off the bed, and lifted the pillow.\n Odd, I thought, and touched base with theory. The boy must still be alive, or else there would be no room. If he\u2019s alive, he must be in here somewhere. He can\u2019t be invisible, not inside his own head. He can, of course, be anything he likes, so long as it\u2019s animate and alive. A cockroach, for example, or a flea. I sighed. I get all the rotten jobs.\n I adjusted the scale, making the room five times bigger. Go up in easy stages. If he was being a cockroach, he\u2019d now be a rat-sized cockroach. If he was being a rat, of course, he\u2019d be cat-sized and capable of giving me a nasty bite. I used lorica, just in case. I looked under the bed again.\n I visualized a clock, in the middle of the wall opposite the door. It told me I\u2019d been inside for ten minutes. The recommended maximum is thirty. Really first-rate practitioners have been known to stay in for an hour and still come out more or less in one piece; that\u2019s material for a leading article in the journals. I searched again, this time paying more attention to the contents of the cupboard. Dried, desiccated animal skins; squirrels, rabbits, rats. No fleas, mites or ticks. So much for that theory.\n I visualized a glass jug, to represent my energy level. You can use yourself up surprisingly quickly and not know it. Just as well I did. My jug was a third empty. You want to save at least a fifth just to get out again. I visualized calibrations, so as to be sure.\n Quick think. The recommended course of action would be to visualize a tracking agent (spaniel, terrier, ferret) but that takes a fair chunk of your resources; also, it burns energy while it\u2019s in use, and getting rid of it takes energy, too. I drew a distinct red line on my measuring-jug, and a blue line just above it. The alternative to a tracker is to increase the scale still further; twenty times, say, in which case your cockroach will be a wolf-sized monster that could jump you and bite your head off. I was still running lorica, but any effective ward burns energy. If I found myself with a fight on my hands, I could dip below that essential red line in a fraction of a second. No, the hell with that.\n I visualized a terrier. I\u2019m not a dog person, so my terrier was a bit odd; very short, stumpy legs and a rectangular head. Still, it went at it with great enthusiasm, wagging its imaginary tail and making little yapping noises. All round the room, nose into everything. Then it sat on the floor and looked at me, as if to say, Well?\n Not looking good. My jug was half empty, I\u2019d used up my repertoire of approved techniques, and found nothing. Just my luck to get a special case, a real collector\u2019s item. Senior research fellows would be fighting each other for the chance of a go at this one, but I just wanted to get the job done and clear out. Wasted on me, you might say.\n I vanished the dog. Quick think. There had to be something else I could try, but nothing occurred to me. Didn\u2019t make sense; he had to be in here somewhere, or there\u2019d be no room. He couldn\u2019t be invisible. He could only turn himself into something he could imagine\u2014and it had to be real; no fantasy creatures the size of a pin-head. At five times magnification, a red mite would be plainly visible; also, the dog would\u2019ve found it. Tracking agents, even inferior ones visualized by me, smell life. If he was in here, the dog would\u2019ve found him.\n So\u2014\n As required by procedure, I considered abandoning the attempt and getting out. This would, of course, mean the boy would die; you can\u2019t go back in twice, that\u2019s an absolute. I\u2019d be within my rights, faced with an enigma on this scale. The failure would be noted on my record, of course, but there\u2019d be an annotation, no blame attaches, and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time, not by a long way. The kid would die; not my problem. I\u2019d have done my best, and that\u2019s all you have to do.\n Or I could think of something. Such as what?\n They tell you; be wise, don\u2019t improvise. If in doubt, get out. Making stuff up as you go along is mightily frowned on, in much the same way as you\u2019re not encouraged to fry eggs in a fireworks factory. There\u2019s no knowing what you might invent, and outside controlled conditions, invention could lead to the Cartographic Commission having to redraw the maps for a whole county. Or you could make a hole in a wall, which is the worst thing anybody can do. At the very least, I\u2019d be sure to end up in front of a Board, facing charges of unauthorized innovation and divergence. Saving the life of some farm kid would be an excuse, but not a very good one.\n I could think of something. Such as\u2014\n There\u2019s no such thing as magic. Instead, there\u2019s the science we don\u2019t properly understand, not yet. There are effects that work, and we have no idea why. One of these is spes aeternitatis, a wretchedly inconsistent, entirely inexplicable conjuring trick that no self-respecting Father would condescend to use. That\u2019s because they can\u2019t get it to work reliably.\n I can.\n Spes aeternitatis is an appearances-adjuster. You can use it to find hidden objects, or translate lies, or tell if a slice of cake or a glass of wine\u2019s got poison in it. I do it by visualizing everything that\u2019s wrong in light blue. It\u2019s a tiny little scrap of talent that I\u2019ve got and practically everybody else hasn\u2019t; it\u2019s like being double-jointed, or wiggling your nostrils like a rabbit.\n I closed my eyes and opened them again, and saw a light blue room. Everything light blue. Everything false.\n Oh, I thought; then, one-oh-five, seventy five, and I started lining up diagonals for my escape. But that wasn\u2019t to be, unfortunately. The room blurred and reappeared, and it was all different. It was my room; the room I slept in until I was fifteen years old.\n He was sitting on the end of the bed; a slight man, almost completely bald, with a small nose and a soft chin, small hands, short, thin legs. I\u2019d put him at about fifty years old. His skin was purple, like a grape.\n \u201cYou were wrong,\u201d he said, looking up at me. \u201cThe talent survives death.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d I said. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d\n He smiled. \u201cYou practically invited me in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I heard that fool behind me, with the axe, I looked at you. You felt sorry for me. You thought; is he not a man and a Brother, or words to that effect. I used Stilicho\u2019s transport, and here I am.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cI should\u2019ve put up wards.\u201d\n \u201cYou should. Careless. Attention to detail isn\u2019t your strongest suit.\u201d\n \u201cThe boy,\u201d I said.\n He shrugged. \u201cIn there somewhere, I dare say. But we aren\u2019t in his head, we\u2019re in yours. I\u2019ve made myself at home, as you can see.\u201d\n I looked round quickly. The apple-box with the bottom knocked out, where I used to keep my books; it was where it should be, but the books were different. They were new and beautifully bound in tooled calf, and the alphabet their titles were written in was strange to me.\n \u201cMy memories,\u201d I said.\n He waved his hand. \u201cWell rid of them,\u201d he said. \u201cMisery and failure, a life wasted, a talent dissipated. You\u2019ll be better off.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cWith yours.\u201d\n \u201cQuite. Oh, they\u2019re not pleasant reading,\u201d he said, with a scowl. \u201cBitter, angry; memories of bigotry and spite, relentless bad luck, a life of constant setbacks and reverses, a talent misunderstood. You\u2019ll see that I failed the exam the second time because, sitting there in Great School, I suddenly hit on a much better way of achieving unam sanctam; quicker, safer, ruthlessly efficient. I tried it out as soon as the exam was over, and it worked. But I got no marks, so they failed me. I ask you, where\u2019s the sense in that?\u201d\n \u201cYou failed the retake,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat about the first time?\u201d\n He laughed. \u201cI had the flu,\u201d he said. \u201cI was practically delirious, could barely remember my name. Would they listen? No. Rules. You see what I mean. Bad luck and spite at every turn.\u201d\n I nodded. \u201cWhat happens to me?\u201d\n He looked at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be better off,\u201d he repeated.\n \u201cI\u2019ll stop existing. I\u2019ll be dead.\u201d\n \u201cNot physically,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cYour body, my mind. Your fully qualified licensed-practitioner\u2019s body, and a mind that saw how to improve unam sanctam in a half-second flash of intuition.\u201d\n It says a lot about my self-esteem that I actually considered it, though not for very long. Half a second, maybe. \u201cWhat happens now?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo we fight, or\u2014?\u201d\n He shrugged.\u201dIf you like,\u201d he said, and extended his arm. It was ten feet long, thick as a gatepost. He gripped my throat like a man holding a mouse, and crushed me.\n I guess I was about seventy percent dead when I remembered; I know what to do. I drew a rather shaky second ward; he closed his fingers on thin air, and I was standing behind him.\n He swung round, roaring like a bull. He had bull\u2019s horns sticking out of his forehead. I tried second ward again, but he got there before I did, grabbed my head and smashed my face into the wall.\n Just in time, I remembered; there is no pain. I used Small Mercies, softening the wall into felt, and slipped through his fingers. I was smoke. I hung above him in a cloud. He laughed, and fetched me back with vis mentis. The back of my head hit the floor, which gave way like a mattress. I became a spear, and buried myself in his chest. He used second ward and was the other side of the room.\n \u201cYou fight like a first-year,\u201d he said.\n Which was true. I clenched my mind like a fist; the walls closed in on him, squashing him like a spider under a boot. I felt him, like a nail right through the sole. Back to first ward, and we stood glowering at each other, in opposite corners of the room.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t beat me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll wear you down and you\u2019ll simply fade away. Face it, what the hell have you got to live for?\u201d\n Valid point. \u201cAll right, then,\u201d I said.\n His eyes opened wide. \u201cI win?\u201d\n \u201cYou win,\u201d I said.\n He was pleased; very pleased. He grinned at me and raised his hand, just as I got my fingers round the handle of the door and twisted as hard as I could.\n He saw that and opened his mouth to scream. But the door flew open, knocking me back. I closed my eyes. The door was, of course, the intersection of two lines drawn diagonally across the room, at 105 and 75 degrees precisely.\n I opened my eyes. He\u2019d gone. I was in the boy\u2019s room, the room upstairs. The boy was sitting on the floor, legs crossed, hands under his chin. He looked up at me.\n \u201cWell, come on,\u201d I snapped at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t got all day.\u201d\n They were pathetically grateful. Mother in floods of tears, father clinging to my arm, how can we ever thank you, it\u2019s a miracle, you\u2019re a miracle-worker. I wasn\u2019t in the mood. The boy, lying on the kitchen table under a pile of blankets, looked up at me and frowned, as though something about me wasn\u2019t quite right. A quiet, analytical stare; it bothered the hell out of me. I refused food and drink and made father get out the pony and trap and take me out to the crossroads. But the mail won\u2019t be arriving for six hours, he objected; it\u2019s cold and dark, you\u2019ll catch your death.\n I didn\u2019t feel cold.\n At the crossroads, huddling under the smelly old hat father insisted on giving me, I tried to search my mind, to see if he\u2019d really gone. There was, of course, no way he could have survived. I\u2019d opened the door (Rule One; never open the door) and he\u2019d been sucked out of my head out into the open, where there was no talented mind to receive him. Even if he was as strong as he\u2019d claimed to be, there was no way he could have lasted more than three seconds before he broke up and dissipated into the air. There was absolutely nothing he could have done, no way he could have survived.\n The coach arrived. I got on it, and slept all the way. At the inn, I got a lamp and a mirror, and examined myself all over. Just when I thought I was all clear, I found a patch of purple skin, about the size of a crab apple, on the calf of my left leg. I told myself it was just a bruise.\n (That was a year ago. It\u2019s still there.)\n The rest of the round was just straightforward stuff; a possession, a small rift, a couple of incursions, which I sealed with a strong closure and duly reported when I got back. Since then, I\u2019ve volunteered for a screening, been to see a couple of counselors, bought a pair of full-length mirrors. And I\u2019ve been promoted; field officer, superior grade. They\u2019re quite pleased with me, and no wonder. I seem to be getting better at the job all the time. And I\u2019m writing a paper, would you believe; modifications to unam sanctam. Quicker, safer, much more efficient. So blindingly obvious, I\u2019m surprised no one\u2019s ever thought of it before.\n Father Prior is surprised but pleased.

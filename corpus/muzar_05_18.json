Drywall dangles like rotting teeth, and the charred posters on my wall look apocalyptic. The faces of kittens and J-Pop idols have been burned away, and singed wallpaper drifts off on the smallest of breezes like black snow. Of all the rooms in our house the only one damaged when the giant robot arm fell from space was mine.\n I unzip my backpack and dig out a canvas banner. It\u2019s big and glossy and red and it says Fighting Ladybugs in scrawling yellow type. It belongs to the school, but I found it rotting in dust-coated storage. I plan on hanging it in front of the hole until someone comes to fix my room. The poster will keep winter weather out, since sprinklings of real snow have coated the black floorboards twice in the past three days. It\u2019ll also block out the gawkers outside.\n Dad says it\u2019s a reflection of the times that the government takes so damn long to clean up these goddamn messes, and these superstitious townies can\u2019t be bothered to bring us some over-baked casseroles during daylight hours. They abandoned them on our back porch in the middle of the night, and raccoons eat out the creamy centers, so we wake up to charred edges. It\u2019s a goddamn common courtesy, Dad says. Doesn\u2019t anyone have morals anymore? He likes to call our town an \u201coglerville\u201d full of anti-robot fanatics. Once, on the bus, I saw a woman get her Pro-Ro hat ripped right off. The fuming lady who had done it screamed that Asian robots have ruined our economy. They\u2019ve taken away jobs and spoiled family ideals, whatever that means. Mom was with me when the angry woman\u2019s face turned a veiny red. Mom took hold of my hand and kept her eyes on the window, staring out at the passing cars and humming, as if there was nothing more interesting than the zip of color that sped by.\n Sunlight seeps into my room and paints everything like a movie set. I imagine that the title is something like Girl Alone and it\u2019s about how everyone else has vanished, leaving me and my room as the leftover crumbs. I already asked Mom if I could buy the wiry plastic vines sold at the craft stores for decorations. That way it would look insanely creepy. (My best friend Amy uses insanely to describe everything now. This bracelet is insanely cute. Those guys are insanely ratchet. That hole is insanely huge. Stuff like that.) But Mom says it\u2019s a dumb idea and a waste of money.\n Outside, reporters stand with their camera crews. A massive van with the Channel 5 news logo looms in our driveway. They\u2019re doing more follow-up stories on the loss of the robot arm and the impact it\u2019s had on the community. I wave my arms at them and mouth \u201cgo away, go away,\u201d but they continue to adjust their silver reflectors. One cameraman sits down on our lawn, tears open a paper-wrapped sandwich and tosses his trash on the ground.\n Next to the reporters, gawkers linger. They snap pictures with their phones and post them on their blogs. They obsessively check their follower count and pat themselves on the back when they come up with some clever tagline.\n This family sure needs a hand.\n They don\u2019t look like they\u2019re having a HOLE lot of fun.\n At school, my classmates show me the best ones as they slap their thighs and laugh and laugh. They pull at the skin of their eyes and speak in gibberish. \u201cI\u2019m a Japanese Robot!\u201d they chant as they run in circles.\n I pick up a scorched square of wood and toss it out the window. It lands close to a gawker. Everyone looks up, their mouths open like turkeys in the rain. \u201cGet away from here!\u201d I shout, but they don\u2019t listen. The reporter waves to his cameraman. Pictures are taken.\n I won\u2019t have to look at them for much longer. Once the banner goes up, I\u2019ll finally have my room back, and the reporter won\u2019t have anything to film. Everyone will have to go home and our house will become our house again.\n My posters may have turned into delicate ash paper, but they\u2019ve still protected the sticky tack that holds them in place. I peel the blue putty from the walls, roll it into a giant ball, and carry it with me to the part of my room where my bed once was. If I close my eyes, I can still see the pink and yellow sheets, my star-shaped pillow and my oversized plush bunny with its missing eye. Dad says I used to carry it around everywhere, but I don\u2019t remember that.\n The poster goo clings to my fingers as I struggle to press it against the drywall. It sticks like snotty hot glue, thinning itself out every time I try to wipe it off. People shout at me, pointless words I can\u2019t hear over the thrilling sound of my heartbeat. Even the slightest tilt to the side and I\u2019d fall straight to the ground. It\u2019s scary. It\u2019s exciting.\n I pancake the wad of blue putty flat against the tired wood, then press a corner of the banner into it. It feels like I\u2019m casting a magic spell. When this thick canvas is in position, my whole room will sparkle back to normal or maybe even better, like when the fairy godmother turned Cinderella\u2019s old ripped up dress brand new.\n The banner stays stuck to the wall for a few seconds, then the end curls back and it falls away. I can\u2019t catch it before it tumbles out of the hole and toward the screaming people below.\n The robot arm was gone by the time I was brought home. Big trucks were called in, the kind that haul space shuttle parts. Cable wires and pulleys and firemen and the military were used to ease it from my house like a stubborn splinter. They spirited it away to some secret place to study its working parts or dismantle it.\n From the trending pictures I\u2019ve seen online and the ones mom took, the arm was about the size of a minivan, and a rusted purple color with three missing fingers. Those were later found cratered in a parking lot some five miles away, each one about the length of my arm.\n A national magazine asked me to pose with the fingers for a hundred dollars. I said not gonna happen, so they rushed to find someone else with my black hair and dark eyes. Three shades lighter than me and a few inches taller, but even my friends were fooled, asking if it was scary, asking if the fingers moved on their own. My friends also wanted to come over, to stand in my dead room. Classmates who\u2019d never spoken to me started asking too. And teachers. Everyone wanted a chance to see the damage up close.\n In our dining room, Mom sits with a foam ball between her legs. It\u2019s the size of a softball and wrapped in white string. Several pins stick out of the sides at odd angles. Mom reminds me of the waiting people at the mall, the ones who hover by doors, pacing or swaying, constantly checking their phones, worrying that the person they\u2019re waiting for will never come. Their impatience and fear hardens around them like a thin chocolate coating. It makes them unapproachable.\n Mom jabs the ball with her needle. This is her eighth or ninth attempt at making a Temari, a Japanese embroidered ball. They are said to bring good luck and happiness. A finished Temari looks like a quilt of string. Bright colors twirl into beautiful triangles and octagons and swirling spirals. Mom\u2019s Temari looks like a tangled mess. Her failures are piled up by her feet. She presses her toes against one and cracks the Styrofoam in half.\n \u201cDid Granny Mae make those before she died?\u201d My voice wobbles around the room like a disoriented fly tapping against a windowpane.\n \u201cNo, dear,\u201d Mom says, though she pauses her work to stare at the wall behind my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n \u201cDid you go to work today?\u201d\n \u201cNo, dear.\u201d She struggles to get a spindly piece of purple thread through the needle head. \u201cI\u2019m taking time off until we get the house fixed up; you know that.\u201d The government is supposed to fix my room. That\u2019s what the official on TV said, before advertising a link where official donations could be made to the family. Dad likes to yell about how we haven\u2019t seen a cent. \u201cIt\u2019s 1984!\u201d he says, squeezing the neck of a beer bottle. \u201cEven Orwell couldn\u2019t make this crap up.\u201d I want to tell him it\u2019s not 1984\u2014the robot arm didn\u2019t send us back in time\u2014but I hate when he yells.\n I hold onto the doorframe and swing my body back and forth. I can hear water sloshing in my stomach. I feel restless and shout, \u201cI know how to fix my room!\u201d\n I dig my nails into the wood of the doorframe. I imagine a massive crack in the wall behind Mom. It speeds toward the ceiling like a snake slithering in tall grass. Its many arms branch out around Mom in dark rays, the opposite of the Holy Mother. The drywall crackles, like frozen branches snapped in half. The entire front of our house collapses and the people outside start smiling. Their faces don\u2019t have noses or eyes, only large, empty grins. Their cameras flash over and over, creating a sea of clicking light.\n It doesn\u2019t matter how soft or loud my voice is, or if my words destroy walls, Mom keeps working on her Temari. Her tongue pokes out as she successfully threads the needle.\n \u201cWill you help me fix my room?\u201d\n \u201cNo, dear.\u201d\n \u201cBut I need more hands than mine.\u201d I hop back and forth on one foot. \u201cMaybe not four hands exactly, but at least three. Just some fingers even.\u201d She doesn\u2019t say anything. It wouldn\u2019t be hard for her to use just one hand, but she\u2019s keeping them both to herself, for her stupid Temari project. \u201cYou never help me with anything anymore,\u201d I say.\n She looks up from her work and her mouth is an angry line. She holds her arms out, releasing the needle. It swings freely like a shining pendulum. \u201cAre you blind?\u201d she snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m busy.\u201d Mom looks down at the messy thread piles on the floor, then back at me. \u201cDo you understand how much time this takes?\u201d She shakes her head, disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ll help you with your project after dinner.\u201d She lifts up her white thread ball and adjusts one of the loose pins.\n \u201cWill you really?\u201d I ask.\n She hums a response and loops her needle around the pin, yanking the bright purple thread along. I watch it, transfixed. I open my mouth to say the purple makes it ugly, but purple used to be my favorite color and she might think it\u2019s weird that now it makes my head hurt.\n When the giant robot arm fell from the sky and crashed into my bedroom, I was at the mall. I remember the little details, like the florescent lights irritating my eyes, and how I scuffed the toe of my brand new flats, and the smells of pretzel butter and muddy tile. I remember my best friend, Amy, and her older brother Avery arguing about going home early as I wandered to the sale racks in the back, where I found the most beautiful skirt, a purple one with gold flowers.\n I don\u2019t remember the drive home or Avery pulling up to my house or me jumping out of the back seat of the car. I don\u2019t remember kneeling on the wet pavement, as my ripped tights soaked in dirty water or screaming until my face looked like an overripe cherry. I don\u2019t remember Mom throwing a blanket over my head and dragging me away. Even though I\u2019ve watched the videos, I don\u2019t remember.\n Over the past week, the videos have played nonstop on every news station in town, feeding people\u2019s dislike of us. I\u2019ve seen what they\u2019ve written online about us.\n Pro-Ro are terrorists.\n Lucky it fell on a Pro-Ro house.\n The Mom\u2019s a MILF, bet she\u2019s into that robot kink, nasty!\n If they were true Antis, this never would\u2019ve happened.\n Pro-Ros should kill themselves.\n I don\u2019t understand. How could it be our fault? The robot arm fell on our house. We didn\u2019t ask a foreign government to run a test over our town. We didn\u2019t dismantle the robot, the atmosphere did. We didn\u2019t predict the future and build our house in this exact spot, fill my room with all my valuables, including the friendship bracelet from my best friend Amy; my Mickey Mouse ears from our vacation; and the painting I did in art class of a crane that Mr. Crotty said was excellent, even though I messed up the beak and feathers, just to have it all burn up.\n We keep the TV off now, because Mom and I would sit in front of it and watch the interviews of people who didn\u2019t know us, but hated us. Even the local reporters told everyone that this was a plan that backfired. That Dad was entangled in a Pro-Ro strategy to invade every single home in the country. It was an act of God that the robot arm destroyed my room.\n \u201cDoes the government like robots?\u201d I asked Mom once.\n \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d she said, flipping to another news channel.\n \u201cBut not every robot is bad.\u201d I picked a scab off my knee. \u201cJust like not all boys are gross.\u201d\n \u201cPeople don\u2019t like change and they don\u2019t like different.\u201d\n \u201cThen they\u2019d like the robots better if they got to know them? How come the government doesn\u2019t make them here? Then people would see them every day and it wouldn\u2019t be different. It\u2019d be normal.\u201d\n Mom sighed and muted the TV. \u201cDo you know what the government\u2019s job is?\u201d\n I shook my head. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d learned about it in school, but it got muddied up with all my other learning.\n \u201cIts job is to make people feel safe. When something scares the majority, the government takes action. That\u2019s why we have Robotics Restriction Laws.\u201d She gave me a look that said no more questions. I don\u2019t know how Mom knows when I\u2019m filled to the brim with questions. That night, huddled on the sofa, I hugged a decorative pillow close and whispered, why?\n Dad is in the living room with his rum. He holds the glass against his bottom lip and taps it with his teeth. In his other hand, he\u2019s got a book, splayed apart with his thumb and pinky.\n \u201cDad. Where\u2019s the stapler gun?\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t say anything. He takes another drink. The ice cubes clink together and a drop of water falls from the bottom of the glass. He struggles to turn the page in his book, flicking the corner as if it were a lighter. The pages are stuck together though, and he has to put his glass down in order to move forward.\n \u201cDad,\u201d I say again, this time louder. \u201cThe stapler gun. I need it.\u201d\n He turns the page, picks up his glass, and makes the same humming noise that Mom did. Sometimes I can\u2019t stomach it, the way they hum at me, like my voice is the distant strum of guitar strings, and all they hear is the melody, not my words.\n I march over to his chair and smack the book out of his hand. It spins three times in the air before it crashes into the ground, bending half its pages.\n His eyes flame with anger, until he realizes that it\u2019s me, then they settle down into something dull and distant. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice you know,\u201d he says, bending forward to retrieve his book.\n \u201cWhere\u2019s the stapler gun?\u201d I ask for the millionth time.\n \u201cYou mean a staple gun?\u201d He takes a long drink, then rises from his chair. \u201cWe don\u2019t have one. Why?\u201d He walks to a shelf where a bunch of bottles sit in a neat line. My art teacher has bottles like that, only they\u2019re all different colors and they\u2019re empty, and he blows in them to make cool sounds.\n \u201cI need it,\u201d I say.\n He uncorks one of the bottles and fills his glass. He chugs it, gulping the way kids do when they press their mouths to the water fountain, then he fills it again. \u201cJust use a regular old stapler.\u201d He returns to his seat, slouches down, and bends the spine of his book.\n \u201cThere are people outside,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know where Mom keeps the regular old stapler.\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t say anything, just licks his thumb and turns the page of his book. The cover looks boring. All white with big red letters that are smashed together. I think they say something like Can Things Turn Back to Normal After a Giant Robot Arm Destroys Your Bedroom? but I can\u2019t really tell because the handwriting is really bad and his fat thumb is in the way.\n I grab the arm of his chair and lean back. My face feels like shoes filled with water. \u201cDad!\u201d I shout, \u201cListen to me!\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d He glares down at me. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n \u201cThere are people outside,\u201d I say, letting go of the chair and crashing headfirst into the ground. It doesn\u2019t hurt. It doesn\u2019t feel like anything. \u201cThey have signs with them.\u201d\n \u201cReally?\u201d He closes his book around his finger. \u201cAnd what do their signs say?\u201d\n \u201cSomething bad, probably.\u201d\n He shrugs and settles back into his chair. \u201cThey\u2019ll go away eventually. Next week there will be some other family in the news for them to harass. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n I sigh and press my forehead to the leg of the chair. Sometimes adults can be so dumb. Why does he care about next week, when the people are there now?\n \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d\n \u201cAsk your mom,\u201d he says, and he\u2019s already gone, fading back into the pages of his book.\n I know one of the people outside. I can see her through the skinny window beside our front door. It\u2019s my best friend Amy.\n She couldn\u2019t have driven here by herself. Her brother is probably nearby. Avery is in high school and he knows how to drive a car already, so that means he has to take Amy and me to the mall. He drops us off at the front, then swings back by two hours later for pick up. I used to think Avery was handsome, because he was tall and because of his car. But up close, he has all of these pimples on his skin and his teeth are tinted brown around the gums.\n \u201cHello,\u201d I say, opening the door.\n Amy wears a dark, oversized hoodie\u2014her brother\u2019s\u2014and sweatpants. The hood is up, tight over her face, and her long hair dangles from the opening like tangled yarn.\n \u201cLong time, no see,\u201d I say, even though it\u2019s not true. We see each other at school, mostly in the hallways now. She spends a lot of time in the counselor\u2019s office, and during lunch she eats in the classroom.\n She doesn\u2019t say anything, just stands there like a ghost. Sometimes, at sleepovers, we\u2019d joke about having robot boyfriends. Androids with silver skin and pop star hair. I always called mine Jeffrey, but Amy could never settle on a name.\n \u201cI need to get my banner,\u201d I say. The news people have unfolded it already. Their reporter stands in front of it as she speaks into the camera. She points to the Fighting Ladybugs scrawl and nods solemnly.\n Amy reaches into the pockets of her brother\u2019s jacket. She scoops out handfuls of wrinkled paper and drops them at my feet. They flutter, these paper bird wings, and some pop open to reveal their scribbled insides. I already know what\u2019s written on them. I throw my own collection of notes in the trash every day after school.\n There\u2019s a mess of people surrounding the banner, touching the corners of it with their greasy hands. Some of them are gawkers, trying to wiggle in close so they can get their faces on TV. My chest feels full of pillow stuffing. I need that banner or else my room can\u2019t get fixed.\n \u201cLook at what you\u2019ve done to me,\u201d Amy says, so I look. She\u2019s the same Amy as last week, only tired. Plus, it sounds like she stole that line from a midafternoon TV drama, the kind her mother likes.\n \u201cI can\u2019t go out today, I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d Above my head, looms the hole of my room. I can\u2019t see it from here, but it\u2019s there. \u201cWill you get that banner for me?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk to any reporters without my parents.\u201d\n Amy stands taller and several gawkers on our lawn examine her. My belly fills up with minnows, swimming around and tickling my sides. Amy and I have been friends since kindergarten. We used to call ourselves the Super Girls, until two years ago when Amy dubbed it insanely immature. We share lip gloss and homework, and during lunch we play M.A.S.H. to decide our futures. Mansion, apartment, shack, house, what kind of car will you drive, how many pets will you own, who\u2019s gonna love you? We circle the answers with purple ink.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d I say, even though she hasn\u2019t moved. I know she\u2019ll go to the reporters for me. I know she\u2019ll take my sign back, and we\u2019ll rush to my room and smash it onto the broken wall. The Super Girls save the day!\n Something wet splatters my shirt and chills my skin.\n An egg.\n Amy throws another one and it explodes on my shoulder. Pieces of shell slip down my arm. The reporters clammer closer, hunched forward with their cameras and microphones.\n \u201cGo away, Pro-Ros, go!\u201d Amy shouts, but her voice sounds small underneath the noise of people surging closer.\n \u201cHey girls, look here!\u201d\n Flashes of light as bright as the sun.\n \u201cAnother twist to this shocking story. An act of violence . . . \u201d\n Camera lenses circle my porch like starved zombies.\n Amy chucks another egg, but it bounces off my chest and cracks on the ground. Yolk oozes around my toes. I want to pull her hair or slap her face, but I just stand there, sticky and wet.\n \u201cSomebody should call someone!\u201d\n Mom steps onto the porch and brushes past me. \u201cGet out of here!\u201d she screams, throwing the lopsided Terami she\u2019s made. \u201cYou can\u2019t be on my lawn. This is private property!\u201d The cameramen turns their lenses toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s private!\u201d\n Dad is behind her. He puts a hand on her shoulder, trying to lead her back into the house. \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he says.\n \u201cWe\u2019re good people. A terrible thing happened to us, but we\u2019re still good people! So leave us alone! Who gives a damn about robots anyway!\u201d\n Amy jumps off the porch, but people surge around her. They peck with their questions: Did you have this planned? What are your thoughts about Pro-Ros? Have you always hated robots? Who are you?\n They\u2019re locusts, swarming around each other to get to Amy. A reporter trips and knocks over a cameraman. Protesters hoist their signs higher and shout at the hole in my room.\n \u201cCome on.\u201d Dad turns Mom toward the house and drags her back through the threshold. \u201cYou too,\u201d he says to me. \u201cAnd don\u2019t open this door again without my permission.\u201d\n Inside, Dad releases Mom. She drops to her knees, cradling her hands against her chest. \u201cSo what if a robot smashed our house? We\u2019re still good people,\u201d she sobs. The people outside grow louder.\n \u201cWhat the hell were you doing?\u201d Dad doesn\u2019t look at me. He sways and catches the wall with his shoulder. \u201cI told you they\u2019d go away. You can\u2019t give them attention or else they multiply. Go upstairs and get cleaned up.\u201d\n \u201cWe should move out of this place,\u201d Mom says.\n \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n \u201cBut the city said they\u2019d pay for the damages, didn\u2019t they? Why hasn\u2019t anyone come to help us?\u201d\n I look at my parents, Mom on the floor, Dad sagging against the wall. They look so hopeless, like my old dolls who are sealed up in a plastic bin, waiting for the day when I decide to play with them again.\n Okay, I tell myself. Okay.\n I can\u2019t use the banner, since the news people have hoarded it, but our house has bedsheets, blankets, and towels. I don\u2019t know where the stapler is hidden, but I can hammer Mom\u2019s sewing needles into what\u2019s left of the wall.\n My feet bounce up the stairs as my mind twirls like gold thread on a spinning wheel. If the needles don\u2019t work, there\u2019s always Dad\u2019s books. I can create massive stacks of them, twice my height, and build a new wall.\n Something thumps against the side of the house.\n Maybe the robot will come back. Maybe it\u2019ll soar over our house again and drop its other arm\u2014not on my room, but on our lawn. It crushes the signs and cameras underneath its massive weight, turning them to ash. The people who survive place hands over their hearts and thank God for their lives.\n This time, the robot arm is fully functioning. It stands on its fingers and stumbles this way and that, struggling to get its bearings. I\u2019ll call to it, from the hole in my room, and tell it everything. The robot arm will look at me with its elbow, and after a long silence, it\u2019ll shed the metal skin from its forearm. It\u2019ll pick it off the ground, awkwardly at first, but better with a little practice, and cover the gaping hole in my room. We\u2019ll build a new room made of metal, safe for robots and me, safe from eggs and cameras and Mom\u2019s angry mouth and Dad\u2019s whiskey glass.\n Standing in front of my old room, which is filled with the last bits of sunlight, I can already see the change. The scorched pieces of wall are open, inviting, like a blank canvas waiting for fresh paint, like the crowded lawn ready for the second robot arm to fall.\n Chelsea Muzar recently graduated from the University of Nebraska Omaha with her Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing.

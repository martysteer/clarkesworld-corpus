Also to be clear, this isn\u2019t a beauty contest\u2014it\u2019s a riding contest.\u201d Robson was born in Edmonton, Alberta and grew up in Hinton, Alberta, just east of the Canadian Rockies.\nEven as a kid Robson had the writing bug: She wrote a horse book called Born Wild in fifth grade, and in sixth grade she wrote a one-act play based on C. S. Lewis\u2019 The Last Battle. At sixteen, she decided she wanted to be a writer after reading Connie Willis\u2019 \u201cBlued Moon\u201d in Isaac Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction Magazine (January 1984). Robson earned a degree in English from the University of Alberta, and from 2008\u20132012, wrote the wine and spirits column for Canada\u2019s biggest women\u2019s magazine, Chatelaine.\nRobson\u2019s first fiction publication was in the February 2015 issue of Clarkesworld, \u201cThe Three Resurrections of Jessica Churchill.\u201d That same year \u201cWaters of Versailles\u201d was published by Tor.com, \u201cTwo-Year Man\u201d was published by Asimov\u2019s, and \u201cThe Gladiator Lie\u201d came out in anthology Licence Expired: The Unauthorized James Bond. The response from the genre community was immediate: \u201cThe Three Resurrections of Jessica Churchill\u201d was a Sturgeon Award finalist, \u201cTwo-Year Man\u201d was a Sunburst Award finalist, and \u201cWaters of Versailles\u201d was a finalist for the World Fantasy and SFWA Nebula awards and won an Aurora Award.\nSince then, among many other accolades, including being a finalist for the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Sturgeon, Locus, Sunburst, and Astounding awards, her 2017 novelette A Human Stain (Tor.com) won a Nebula Award and her 2018 novella, Gods, Monsters, and the Lucky Peach (Tor.com) won an Aurora Award.\nKelly Robson lived in Vancouver, Canada for twenty-two years before moving to Toronto with her wife, author A.M. Dellamonica. Robson\u2019s debut collection, Alias Space and Other Stories, is just out from Subterranean Press.\nYou hit the scene running in 2015: Not only did you have work in pro venues like Clarkesworld and Tor.com right out of the gate, but some of your work landed major awards nominations, and \u201cWaters of Versailles\u201d won an Aurora award. What was breaking in for you, how did it happen?\nLike most overnight successes, it took decades. I had a long apprenticeship as a passionate SFFH short story reader from teenagerhood on. As a younger adult, I flirted with writing from time to time, but eventually made the commitment in 2005 to give it an honest hard try. I got my first publication nine years after deciding to buckle down, which seems like a reasonable length of time to learn to do a difficult thing at a professional level.\nAside from learning to wrestle with craft, most of the struggles were psychological\u2014giving myself the permission to write, learning to ignore all the back-of-the-head voices that said I couldn\u2019t. What\u2019s neat is that I had no expectations, absolutely no idea that my work would be embraced by the most prestigious venues or win a lifetime-dream award.\nI\u2019ve actually wondered if someday I\u2019ll wake up and find that I\u2019ve been in a coma all this time. I\u2019m only just beginning to get over that now.\nDid the awards and acclaim have an impact on your writing or process?\nI didn\u2019t feel any pressure. I continue to be just so happy to have finally learned to write good stories. Award nominations are exciting, and winning an award is a fabulous surprise, but the biggest and best accomplishment is just writing a story that works.\nUnfortunately, awards don\u2019t make stories happen any quicker or easier. If they did, all bets would be off! Also, I\u2019ve been on the edges of the SFFH writing world for long enough to know that plenty of superb writers never get nominations. With no false modesty: Luck has played a big part in my writing career so far. Hard work and skill too, but lots of luck.\nHas anything changed about your writing\u2014craft, approach, or anything else\u2014since those days before landing your first sales?\nI still have my full-time day job. Drafting hasn\u2019t gotten any faster\u2014three months for a story is typical\u2014and wonky work still gets trunked.\nOne big change is now I get invitations to travel as a writer. The Future Affairs Administration (a Chinese short fiction organization) has brought me to China twice\u2014amazing trips that blew my mind in so many ways. One of my Spanish publishers would like me to visit them when international travel is possible. I also got to visit the Banff Centre for Arts for some futurist consulting.\nA very good change is that I have found some rubrics to help me solve storytelling problems. For me, when a story isn\u2019t working, it\u2019s usually a character problem. I wrote about this for Clarkesworld\u2014\u201cLuke Versus Han: An Approach to Characterization.\u201d\nYour work ranges from light and fun to violent and dark, even going into horror. Are there specific things that a dark/grim/violent narrative does for you (or for readers in general) that appeals to you as a writer?\nFor me, horror is the most difficult genre to write, first because of the emotional and sensory precision, and second, because I think horror should be applied with great sensitivity. I use horror when I try to address something that makes me really angry. I don\u2019t get any joy from writing terrible things, so I have to have a really good reason to reach for a terror weapon\u2014something besides just trying to make a good story.\nYou take on different topics, dig into different moods, write different kinds of stories, and use your fantastic imagination to wonderful effect. Are there aspects of storytelling/writing that you feel are more challenging for you, things you struggle with? And how do you deal with those elements?\nThat\u2019s a huge compliment. I\u2019m passionately interested in a wide range of things, and short stories give me the freedom to do whatever I want, without worrying if readers will follow me from book to book.\nWriting novel-length is definitely a challenge. I like to hold the shape of a story in my mind, and past forty thousand words, that\u2019s very difficult. It\u2019s not necessarily a writing problem, it\u2019s a thinking problem. I get to about forty thousand words and I\u2019m no longer sure what I\u2019m doing and why. I lose the shape and start flailing. I\u2019ll keep working at it and get there eventually.\nYour debut collection, Alias Space, offers readers fourteen pieces of fiction, spanning your career to date. If readers looked at three stories in this book, what would you want them to be, and why?\nI\u2019d like people to read \u201cAlias Space,\u201d \u201cA Study in Oils,\u201d and \u201cWe Who Live in The Heart\u201d: near-future, mid-future, and far-future stories, because SF has always been and will always be the place where my heart rests.\nPublishers Weekly gave Alias Space a glowing review, saying, among other things, \u201cRobson\u2019s work also frequently touches on feminism, gender, and queerness . . . \u201d Is feminism an important aspect of your work\u2014is it deliberate, is it inevitable? Is it an accurate descriptor? Or is it an interpretation that doesn\u2019t always fit?\nSure, all my stories are intersectional feminist, even when it\u2019s not overt. It\u2019s the air I breathe and it\u2019s inevitable, yes, because I don\u2019t even think about it. All art is political.\nGary K. Wolfe, in his Locus review of Alias Space, said, \u201c . . . as eclectic as her settings and narrative modes might be, Robson consistently writes about characters who, within their limitations, simply want to do better.\u201d What is the key to writing great characters?\nI have a trick to this, which I wrote about in \u201cLuke Versus Han: An Approach to Characterization.\u201d The TL;DR is that a character should know either who they are or what they\u2019re doing. Not both. Not neither. I also tend to write characters that are workaholics. I think it\u2019s because it makes them feel driven, and I have to temper that in the rewrite.\nAlso, I like to write about people who, in addition to emotions, have concepts and misconceptions, obsessions, judgments, prejudices, analyses flawed or accurate, suspicions, et cetera, et cetera. Everyone has a system for ordering and understanding the world. We don\u2019t just feel, we analyze. All the time.\nLooking at your career so far, and in particular, at the stories in this collection, are there themes and ideas in your fiction that you often come back to, that stand out as more important to you, or about which you feel passionate?\nI\u2019m constantly writing about people who choose (or are chosen by) parenthood. This is something I can\u2019t seem to get away from; it pops up all the time. Part of the reason is because I\u2019m interested in how systems work, and child-rearing is so rarely acknowledged as an underpinning of all human economic endeavor. If the world doesn\u2019t have a semi-indentured class who are bound by religion and/or tradition to bear and raise children, how is the world getting peopled? Let\u2019s not pretend that humanity wouldn\u2019t die out if child-rearing wasn\u2019t something most people were coerced into. But there\u2019s also, of course, a huge emotional aspect to it, and I like that tension between the practical and the emotional. Parenthood: is it a job or a calling?\nThis is an especially weird obsession because I don\u2019t have kids and never wanted them. But then, I think lots of queer people obsess over parenthood because it\u2019s just never something we can take for granted.\nAre there stories in this collection that were harder to write than others, or pieces that were far more personal than others?\nWriting \u201cLa Vitesse,\u201d I finally figured out how to use my own past as material. It\u2019s funny to claim an action story about dragon killing as an illustration of my soul and the soil it grew in, but there we have it. I\u2019m addicted to writing stories set in my hometown now. It\u2019s so fun to populate that lonely landscape with stories. The stories live there now. They\u2019re as real as the dirt.\nWhat else are you working on now, and what do you have coming up that you can tell us about?\nIn summer 2022, I have a thirty-six thousand-word novella coming from Tor.com Publishing called High Times in the Low Parliament. It\u2019s a neo-medieval lesbian stoner comedy with fairies, and is certified both hilarious and adorable by all who\u2019ve read it. Right now, I\u2019m working on the sequel, Down and Out in the High Parliament, which I hope will be even funnier than the original. I\u2019m having a hoot writing light during these darker times.\nArley Sorg is co-Editor-in-Chief at Fantasy Magazine and a 2021 World Fantasy Award Finalist.

Numbers speak to us in whispers and screams. We weave the world in complex mathematics and the world weaves us back, keeping our sky above and our earth below, keeping our organs inside our bodies, keeping us here, keeping us together.\nThe yarn of quaternions and octonions unravels; it makes a trail inside the Womb. The Asenai men think I\u2019m using it to find our way back and, of course, I let them believe it. But let me tell you a secret, my brother: the yarn is a sliver of the Womb itself. A simple, one-dimensional blood vessel I tore out of my favorite place, out of your prison which I came to love because, to me, its corridors and its deep darkness are brimming with the salty smell of freedom. The Womb is holding the hypercomplex function-manifestation together, woven number by number, written stitch by stitch inside my yarn skein.\nI\u2019m calm, I\u2019m still, as the Asenai battle creatures of my own secret numerical craft. I\u2019m a still spot in the storm, a spider weaving; the function-manifestation must not be disturbed and I must command it fully. It\u2019s almost entrancing, this drawing of strength from the Womb itself. I can hear its pulse; I\u2019m vulnerable, exposed. A tingle of excitement mars the perfect stillness inside me. My brother, I\u2019m on my way.\nFirst unroll, then roll back into a ball. First cast the prince\u2019s skin off, then weave it over my brother\u2019s. My plan is perfect and I know it. I was born for this. I\u2019ve been preparing all my life.\nThe yarn unravels.\nKing Uthar\u2019s court is the stuff of dreams, people say. Cemar is where gods spend luxurious summers, estivating in the dim glory of faience and niello palaces of Iasso and Zachor, their divine reveries conjuring winged griffons and monkeys the color of palaeo-blue\u2014creatures that wander forever on the walls of shaded porticoes rowed in vermillion columns with ebony tops, creatures that look at me with dead eyes, that speak to me in tongues other mortals can\u2019t hear.\nWell, I\u2019m King Uthar\u2019s daughter and I know better. My earliest memories paint him in the distance and my mother at the center\u2014opulent, buxom, a golden vest curving around her exposed, full breasts. Like living bracelets, the sacred snakes of the Goddess coiled around her tanned arms in obedience, deliciously inebriated by the oils of Cemari dittany and frankincense. She was the spitting image of all the frescoes and idols that Uthar wanted to destroy, the frescoes I\u2019ve only seen clandestinely. She wore the visage of her own mother and grandmother\u2014all Queens, all High Priestesses, all using the language of numbers to harness a physical reality that would otherwise run rampant and crush us with its wild, cruel infinity. The visage I, too, should incarnate after her death if only it weren\u2019t for her husband\u2019s greed. That was my mother, a vision so distant I now wonder if it was ever true and not a mere childhood fancy, a reflection of my hope to see her\u2014to see myself\u2014powerful and luminous.\nThe mother I truly knew lived in the prison called the Queen\u2019s Quarters, where I also grew up under the gaze of sleepy dolphins and lapis lazuli doves and other delightful decorations that turned grotesque each evening when the sunlight faded, with their pointy beaks and black-rimmed eyes. My mother sat transfixed on her throne, long black curls flowing down her shoulders, and wouldn\u2019t speak to anyone. She had a little tame dice snake\u2014the only one she was allowed to keep after her husband killed all the sacred beasts\u2014to whom she\u2019d whisper number sequences from time to time, while looking at the world only in side stares. Often, I was handed bowls of lentils with fragrant coriander and honey to give her, or escargots stuffed with rosemary and thyme which was, they said, her favorite. Although I trembled as I left the tray next to her, she wouldn\u2019t even deign to look at me. And I was thankful; when she did, her tawny gaze pierced holes into my heart.\nLike my mother, like all women of our bloodline, I had numbers running in my veins, making my blood bloom with mystical flowers inside me. When our ancestors first arrived in Cemar, a planet so dangerous and strange, numbers became the bridge that took us over boiling lava to a safe shore and saved us. Mathematics was\u2014and is\u2014the only way humanity could deal with the chaos of the universe, the only common language between ourselves and the galaxies. Medee was our first High Priestess, the one who found a way to speak stories in numbers, materialize them and cause changes. She was the one who gave us the plants of her homeland\u2014olive trees and vines, basil and crab apples\u2014the animals\u2014snakes and bulls, the first algebraic creatures she conjured, our sacred beasts\u2014and the fertile land. She is the one who turned Cemar from prison to paradise, truly an avatar of the Goddess. The only one to have invented the magic of numbers that was grafted into her mitochondrial genetic code and, to this day, can be passed to her female progeny only.\nMy father kept an eye on me from an early age. Our art and magic and science weren\u2019t needed anymore, he said, the world was stable. We were more dangerous than useful, he said, our gift way too powerful and easy to abuse. He had already gone too far\u2014snatching the throne from the High Priestess, killing the sacred snakes\u2014and everyone knew that the gods punish the blasphemous, so he didn\u2019t dare touch me or my mother lest he met his ruin. My older brothers, my lady companions in the court, none of them ever truly befriended me as they all were my father\u2019s spies. Fear kept everyone at a distance, yet I found it soothing if not somewhat lonely. We\u2019re strangers with all my siblings\u2014all except Erion.\nErion was born in captivity. My father had already imprisoned my mother by then and hoped to prevent her from continuing her mathematical weaving. Pious men and women warned him that this would endanger Cemar, yet he didn\u2019t listen. Then my brother came, his devious form a sign of profound instability in the world. My father, in his unbridled paranoia, proclaimed him one of my mother\u2019s mistakes, another instance of her dangerous meddling with the world. He locked him up in a lightless laboratory\u2014the remains of Medee\u2019s spaceship, the one that brought her here, the one we called the Womb. He had all of his scientists and mathematicians study him for years until he gave up and left him alone, conveniently out of sight, a poor lifetime prisoner just like my mother. No one could come in or out of this prison; its entrances were a cryptographic secret.\nNo one except myself, of course. Oh, how I love the Womb, how I enjoy its musty smell, its comforting darkness. Even though it is his prison, in there we are alone, just us and the deep magic of endless, twirling walls. Darkness has always been my friend. I taught myself to walk the Womb with eyes closed, guided only by the numbers that run in my veins. It led me to its center, to Erion. A head too large for his shoulders, a bullish snout and two horns\u2014and eyes so shiny and eager and happy to meet me. We spent hours playing hide and seek in those vast corridors, our giggles echoing, our footsteps reverberating.\n\u201cI brought you honey cakes,\u201d I\u2019d say\u2014his favorites\u2014and he\u2019d stuff his face with their sweetness, squinting happily at the sumptuous aroma like any other boy his age. As we ate, I shared news from the court. I spun tales of the bull leapers in the yearly festival\u2014once, a festival for the Goddess\u2014how they danced on bulls\u2019 backs as if they were creatures of the air, fearless. Erion watched me in wide-eyed fascination, his mind running wild with things he\u2019d never see. All he ever knew was the dark cocoon of the Womb.\nMy brother had the heart of an artist, I soon discovered. Once, I brought him seashells I had gathered from the deep violet shore nearby Iasso palace, to decorate his lonely lair. Next time I was there, Erion had carved one of them with a tiny chisel he\u2019d made himself out of eating utensils. In the light of the torches, I watched the bull leapers unfolding in front of my eyes in perfect detail, as if Erion had been there at the festival with me. I ran my finger over the miniature\u2019s prickly pattern, admiring it as tears stung my eyes.\n\u201cFather doesn\u2019t want me to go out much,\u201d I told him one day. \u201cHe wants me to stay with mother, to keep her company.\u201d Day by day, the Queen\u2019s Quarters became my own prison. Escaping through my secret door was my hope, the Womb my sanctuary.\n\u201cIs mother ill, Sadne?\u201d Erion asked in his attentive manner, always worrying about a mother he had never met. His eyes shone in the torches\u2019 flame, hungry for love and recognition, a well he could never fill. For a long time, he had known his mother only through my eyes and my narrations; I was his link to a world that had been denied to him.\n\u201cShe won\u2019t leave her chambers . . . doesn\u2019t talk, only stares into the distance. They say numbers drive us all mad one day, but I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s just mathematics that claimed her mind. Oh, you\u2019re not missing out on much, really. I get bored there. It\u2019s so much better to come here and see you.\u201d By the end of my words my cheeks were burning, my voice had gone raspy. Emotion I had learned to suppress suddenly found its way up, provoking me to say things I didn\u2019t want to. Although I was uttering the truth, I could tell Erion was still jealous. He sulked, lowering his bullish head so deep his shoulder blades protruded\u2014so white, so soft, I noticed. I wondered how healthy he could stay in such confinement.\n\u201cWill she ever want to see a monster like me?\u201d he whispered, voice shaking. My heart sank at his words.\n\u201cDearest, I think mother understands how you are,\u201d I said softly and not without honesty. \u201cShe is like me, remember? We can see things that aren\u2019t there to mortal eyes. Your symmetry is perfect. She knows it, but is simply too ill to tell you. I know she loves you.\u201d\nI reached out and touched his hand. When I looked down at our feet, all I saw was a little boy\u2019s thin legs, feet wrapped in tattered sandals. Yet his head too, was his own, as much Erion as his human parts. I touched his cheek, lowered his bovine skull gently onto my shoulder, its horns still too small to poke me. A perfect topology; his functions a poem. How could others not see it? He accepted the touch quietly. We sat there for a long time, the darkness our mother.\n\u201cOne day, we\u2019ll run away,\u201d I promised, my muscles tensing suddenly, old anger rising inside me again.\nErion was silent.\nThe yarn unravels. The first time we found a dead body it was still fresh and warm.\nI tripped on it in the darkness and upon feeling the emaciated flesh under my fingers I gasped in panic. A soft whiff of putrid smell carried the first signs of decay. Something of my mother visited me that day.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Erion asked and, before I could say anything to protect him, he cast the torch\u2019s light over my shoulders. His pupils contracted, the way animal eyes shrink in fear. I held his hand and refused to turn away. That was my father\u2019s doing and I wanted to bear witness to it.\nIn his long war with the Asenai, Uthar employed dirty, cruel intimidation tactics. I never knew about the high-ranking prisoners\u2014sons of ministers and nobles\u2014that he locked up in the Womb and let wander until they reached either madness or death. I learned of it that very day. The Womb, Medee\u2019s beautiful ship, the ruins we\u2019ve loved, had become a synonym to heartless torture.\nWe made a purpose of finding those bodies before someone collected them and shipped them back to Asenai defiled, in blatant mockery and disrespect. I offered them a last kindness\u2014a rudimentary passing ritual of honey and wine libations, to give their souls rest. At those times I wondered why my mother was the mad one when my father found such things acceptable\u2014when we all did. Anger had been a small, spiteful animal growing inside me for years.\nEscape was what I dreamed of in those days. Escape, more than claiming my rightful throne. Erion hopelessly tried to convince me otherwise.\n\u201cYou will be a great queen and you\u2019ll be kind to me too. The world needs your weaving or more accidents, more . . . more things like me will happen.\u201d He was begging me.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a mistake, Erion. You\u2019re perfect,\u201d I insisted, furious at his self-hate. \u201cLet this world crumble, let bull boys and snake girls be born everywhere!\u201d\nHesitating for a second, he gulped and said, \u201cYou must. I can help you. If father must die, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019m a monster anyway. No need for you to be the patricide. I know you will be a merciful queen to me, so I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nBy then, his voice, his shoulders were shaking. Even the thought of murder chilled his blood, yet he was willing to try it. My brother, with the heart of an artist, becoming a killer!\n\u201cNo, sweet brother, no. Don\u2019t say such things. You\u2019re not a monster!\u201d I cupped his hands in mine. The thought of patricide didn\u2019t scare me as much as it should have. I knew the gods were merciless in their hunt of killers and I knew my father feared them too\u2014why else keep my mother and myself alive if not for fear of divine punishment? But I didn\u2019t care. All I wanted was freedom and my father could rot on his alabaster throne and this whole wretched palace could collapse on his shoulders\u2014I simply didn\u2019t care. \u201cWe\u2019ll both escape. I have a plan.\u201d\nI tried to smile, but Erion wore his familiar sulk. He didn\u2019t like thoughts of escape; they scared him. He had never experienced freedom, not once in his life, so how could it not terrify him? Clinging onto a dream where I\u2019m queen\u2014I, his only ally in the world\u2014was the only future he could imagine for himself that wasn\u2019t as bleak as the Womb\u2019s darkest corners.\n\u201cDo you think death will be a release?\u201d was all he said. It came so easily to him to think of death as the only path to freedom. That moment, I couldn\u2019t say anything. \u201cI think mother is waiting for death,\u201d he continued, darkly. \u201cIt\u2019s the only place for her now.\u201d\n\u201cYou have a place with me, Erion,\u201d was all I managed to say. How I regret my words now. Oh, how I could have done things differently.\nHis beady animal eyes smiled to me. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe yarn stops rolling. That\u2019s when the Asenai boy arrived.\nComing all the way from the other side of the solar system, his chest wide and sculpted, eyes sparkling with self-assurance, the otherworldly prince stood taller than the rest of us, us little dark-skinned Cemari, descendants of refugee ships, us little barbarians worshipping snake goddesses, little fools ruled by wonderful King Uthar and his terrible fleet. His spaceships\u2014ugly, rusty beasts so unlike ours\u2014stirred and crushed the wheat of our fields on the very first day of the temporary armistice\u2014one the prince intended to break, of course. I ran to meet him. By then, I had grown into a woman, Erion into a young man. Teseo\u2019s eyes stopped lasciviously over my bare breasts, which I covered immediately. I know Asenai women dress head to toe and stay indoors, so Asenai men think women who show their breasts must be everyone\u2019s women.\n\u201cWhat a beautiful daughter King Uthar has,\u201d he said in a slurred accent, evidently not uninterested to bed me. The moment I saw him I set my mind on my plan, so I led him on, made him believe I was so infatuated with him that I\u2019d betray all of my people\u2019s secrets to him. You see, I disliked him instantly and yet with my antipathy came the spark of opportunity: he had ships that could carry us all the way to Asenai. I\u2019m not a woman who will wait for a man to rescue her, but in the kind of prison I live one ought to make most of everything.\n\u201cThe mutant that lives in the Womb killed your brothers. Avenge them and save me from my father\u2019s tyranny.\u201d Oh, Erion. The lies I\u2019ve told. I offered him the goblet that was forged in moonlight, filled with wine I had bathed in dark rituals of smoke, sap, torn flesh, and the macabre juices of nightmares. \u201cDrink honeyed wine, my lord, to make you strong against the bull-faced monster.\u201d So the foolish prince drank along, thinking I really was a witch and I was giving him power.\nThe moment he tried to make a move towards me he fell, face on the floor, snoring loudly. Once all of his mates were sleeping soundly, I ran. I had only moments before sunrise, moments to tell Erion of my plan. I entered the Womb like a stalking cat, following the familiar trail with eyes closed. Erion was awake, waiting for me, tense and nervous.\n\u201cMy brother, prepare. Tonight we free ourselves.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t move. Still nervous, he shifted in his seat, as if the wine flask I offered him was cursed. \u201cWhat is your plan, Sadne?\u201d I sensed his careful inflection at that moment, his silent disapproval. I dismissed it as fear and cowardice.\n\u201cI have woven a thread of hypercomplex numbers that can copy the prince\u2019s likeness,\u201d I began explaining my craft. \u201cBut I can\u2019t create a topological vector from him and directly onto you\u2014I have only created the vessel for this. So it must be passed from the prince to you, cover you like a blanket.\u201d I showed him the weapon, an antique double axe of no worth, lined with a verdigris patina of rust. \u201cThe function is in here. When he strikes you, the vector will mirror your actions and he will die while you\u2019ll don his appearance like a fresh shirt. Then we\u2019ll sail on his starship to freedom.\u201d\nHe looked at me incredulously, then at the bronze double axe. \u201cWill we succeed?\u201d\n\u201cTrust me, my brother.\u201d I touched his hand, spoke in my best older sister\u2019s voice. \u201cI have a one-dimensional yarn of manifold space, a simple line that goes on and on. As I unroll it, it will take the Womb\u2019s power in it. All parts of the function-manifestation shall be stored in there and I\u2019m strong enough to hold it, so fear not. Soon we\u2019ll be away from Cemar, away from father. There are so many planets where they will receive a High Priestess like myself with honors and accolades. Surely, they won\u2019t turn you away, my own brother.\u201d\nHe stirred, his eyes showing some sudden courage still laden with doubt. \u201cWhat if father has word of where we are? They say he discovered that old scientist hiding in the outer colonies and punished him for running away.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if he comes after us you might have your chance to be a patricide,\u201d I said, my patience suddenly snapping. I saw the wound I opened only at the very last moment. I touched his hands again, the delicate yet callused fingers of an artist. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my brother. Will you trust me now? Follow me in this plan until we get on the Asenai ship to freedom?\u201d\nMy own voice shook at that moment. Eventually it broke and tears filled my eyes. The big sister turned into a frightened girl. Something about Erion changed just then. At my weakened state, he found the strength he lacked. He nodded silently, a single tear tracing his cheek. I wiped it and kissed the bristle hair of his skin.\n\u201cI have a gift for you,\u201d he said and presented me with a pendant he had crafted\u2014a pale nautilus, the smallest I\u2019ve ever seen, carved in great detail. In the soothing symmetry of its iridescent spirals, I clearly saw myself, Erion, the Womb; us eating honey cakes, watching the bull leaping festival, playing chess. And in a small corner I saw a miniature of our mother, sitting on her throne, snake around her arm, exactly as I had described her. On her face I think I saw a smile, but the carving was too small so I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep it close to my heart,\u201d I thanked him and lowered it over my head. Erion looked pleased for a moment, eyes blinking with satisfaction.\nFirst unroll, then roll back into a ball. First cast Teseo\u2019s skin off, then weave it over my brother\u2019s, like a serpentine ecdysis. No companions will be left by then\u2014my own horrors inside the Womb shall take care of them.\nMy plan was perfect and I knew it. I was born for this, I\u2019ve been preparing all my life. I went to bid my mother goodbye\u2014my mother, whom I barely knew, yet whom I strangely pitied in her wide-eyed, shocked silence, because she was like me, trapped, mystical, because she was who I might become and I resented her for this. I kissed her cheek in a moment of wild impulse and she let me. I think she even reacted a little bit, a tiny smile forming on her lips, just like the one she had on Erion\u2019s carved nautilus. Her skin was soft and plump and suddenly I craved for more. I touched her hand, cool like morning dew, tissue still firm like a young girl\u2019s. My mother, my beautiful mother, locked away, lost in the whispers of algebraic gods. Maybe it was too much to take and she went mad. I would never know. All I knew was that I couldn\u2019t let myself become her. All I knew was that tonight, I was running away.\n\u201cGoodbye, my mother,\u201d I whispered and let go of her hand. She didn\u2019t respond but I cared little. Tonight, I was running away, and my plan was perfect.\nI kicked the ball of yarn.\nOnly a little of the yarn is left. I tug it snugly as we enter Erion\u2019s chamber.\nAll has gone to plan. Teseo is alone\u2014all his companions dead\u2014breathing heavily under sweat and sticky blood. He squints at me suspiciously, at the Cemari witch with the cat\u2019s eyes, the eyes that seek my brother. I hope for a menacing growl, a powerful glimpse of the fearful monster yielding a double-edged axe, the axe that will unstitch the bodies then stitch them back in different order. At last, I find him, but he is just sitting there, crafting his wooden toys, no blade in his hand, only a craftsman\u2019s carving tool. What are you doing, dear brother? What are you doing?\nHe hasn\u2019t seen him yet, hasn\u2019t seen my brother\u2019s slouched shoulders and lissom figure and I wonder what the tall, sinewy man will think of this pale boy with the bull\u2019s head he\u2019s about to challenge to battle. He swings his sword. \u201cBeast, come face me! I challenge you to battle! I, Teseo, the Prince of Asenai, the planet that you\u2019ve terrorized and disgraced all these years, eating up our sons and daughters alive!\u201d\nThe Asenai boy\u2019s grandiloquence makes me sick but I have no time for him; my stomach is tied into a knot as I watch Erion slowly rising in the darkness, then stepping into the light unarmed. Instinctively, I put my body between his and the man\u2019s who wishes to kill him. Teseo pauses; waits to see what sort of magic spell I\u2019ve prepared to help him, but I have nothing, nothing but tears that are slowly filling my eyes, having nowhere to go.\n\u201cSadne, please stand aside.\u201d\nI don\u2019t understand (oh, but I do). Erion, why? I wish to ask (but, oh, I know the answer). My brother looks at me with his two eyes, the eyes of a bull, the eyes of a child, so full of sadness and pity for the world, for himself. In them I see a spark of hope, but it is so unlike my own. Oh, but I do know the answer. All the times I dreamed of running away Erion dreamed of death and how its silence must feel like the Womb. Erion, why? Why?\n\u201cSadne, save yourself.\u201d\nI\u2019m still standing between them, a wave of tension coming from Teseo, a serene acceptance emanating from Erion.\nPossibilities spread their constellations in front of my eyes. I have a choice, yet it\u2019s not a choice I want because Erion has already made his. The constellations that shine more brightly inside my corneas are these:\nOne. I can let the prince kill my brother, then run away with the killer.\nTwo. I can kill the prince\u2014because Erion won\u2019t do it\u2014and let both of us live.\nBut this is no choice at all.\nSurely, you must know what I\u2019d choose, if I could. Erion, you surely do know, because you trapped me.\nI look at the yarn. The function it\u2019s holding quivers so strongly that I\u2019ve borrowed the Womb\u2019s very essence to maintain it. If I let go of it now, the yarn so deeply unraveled, there won\u2019t be a way to neatly roll it back. It will tangle like an abandoned vineyard, a clot into the Womb\u2019s bloodstream, making the tunnels collapse on us. We will all die. Sadne, save yourself.\nGods, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\nMy hands are tied. Tears fill my eyes and there\u2019s nothing I can do. Last night I set a trap for myself. Oh Goddess, I set up a bigger prison and locked myself in.\nI have no choice at all.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I stammer at last. I can feel Teseo hesitating slightly, taken aback by the strange exchange between me and the beast.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a killer, Sadne,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cYou taught me that.\u201d\nThe world spins around me, the yarn pulses like an animal\u2019s heart between my hands.\n\u201cLet\u2019s run,\u201d I whisper and if Teseo hears me he probably thinks I\u2019m talking to him, suddenly afraid in front of the Womb\u2019s beast. My brother shakes his head calmly and meets my eyes again in silent understanding. There\u2019s a smile on his bullish snout and I know he is not crying because he cried alone, when I wasn\u2019t there.\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave. I will only be but danger to you, to both of us. To me, the whole world is a prison. I think I finally understand our mother, Sadne. I belong here.\u201d\nI wish to say something to him, to take his hand just like I took my mother\u2019s hand before I left her. Even that small thing, he won\u2019t let me do. Kindly, he touches my shoulders\u2014I can feel Teseo flinch\u2014and with a brisk movement pushes me aside before the young prince strikes. The blade comes out scarlet; Erion is on the floor. Thank you, I can hear, my senses heightened by all the world-changing numbers I\u2019m floating in. Thank you, for being my sister.\nA surge of anger and sadness fills me and I can feel the function-manifestation\u2014the useless function\u2014shaking in my hands. Why not let go of it and let it bury us in the Womb forever? But something keeps me from doing it, that self-preservation instinct I\u2019ve had since I was young, the one Erion never developed.\nMy brother, all you wanted was to escape, just like I did. But no place on earth would take you. So you led me on, as I led on the Asenai prince, to help me run away, because you knew I\u2019d never do it without you.\nNow I understand.\nThe yarn rolls back into a ball. As I pick up the thread, time has no meaning anymore. I can see the future, clear and sharp like a piece of glass.\nI\u2019ll follow Teseo onto his ship, get him drunk to unconsciousness every night so that I won\u2019t have to suffer the touch of his dirty fingers on my skin.\nWhen we reach our first starport I\u2019ll leave him and find those who will recognize my power, those who will revere the kiss of the Goddess on my forehead.\nI will grow strong.\nThe thread splits in two.\nMaybe I\u2019ll follow Teseo onto his ship and won\u2019t escape his advances. \u201cI know you want it,\u201d he\u2019ll say and his mates too will take turns with me, laughing at the na\u00efve Cemari girl.\nMaybe when we reach our first port he\u2019ll abandon me and I will roam hungry and cold until someone who recognizes the kiss of the Goddess on my forehead offers me shelter.\nThe threads twine in one again.\nI will grow strong.\nI\u2019ll be human no more; I\u2019ll be one of my mother\u2019s kind. The woman who turned into numbers and became the world.\nThe yarn rolls back into a ball. In there, I put my memories of when I was still a woman: a single thread mapping a linear, mortal life. For now I will grow so much, like a centenarian olive taking deeper root inside earth\u2019s bowels; I will lose so much\u2014my kin, myself, my memories. Time won\u2019t matter. Time won\u2019t be a ball of yarn anymore, unraveling moment after moment, but a nautilus making spirals, where you can cut across and be in different moments at the same time.\nThe yarn has now rolled back into a ball. Now the sea shall live in me and I shall wield its power in waves and motions, the salt between my lips, my fingers growing fins. I\u2019ll be the revenge I seek; I\u2019m coming, father. This time, I won\u2019t avoid you. This time I\u2019m coming to claim back my land.\nBut I\u2019m not a woman anymore. I\u2019m the earth, I\u2019m the ocean. I\u2019m coming, father, and I\u2019m lava glowing red like jewels, I\u2019m rock-cracking earthquake, I\u2019m all-silencing wave. My heart is a volcano and soon it shall wake. For centuries thereafter they will speak of the disaster that befell you, the earth that split in two and the wave that crushed you\u2014I\u2019m that disaster.\nI\u2019m coming to end you, to end me, to end this place. To let this planet live again and to remember the tale of faience and niello palaces, of frescoes of dark-skinned boys and black-haired girls, to remember the tale told by the yarn\u2014the tale of the bull boy, who had a sister that truly loved him.\nEleanna Castroianni is a writer, poet and oral storyteller from Greece.

In 2001 he moved to Oakland, CA and landed a job as editorial assistant at Locus Magazine.\nBorn in Goldsboro, NC, as a child Pratt traveled with his mother, living in Missouri, Texas, Louisiana, and West Virginia, then back to Goldsboro. He graduated from Appalachian State University in Boone, NC with a BA in English, and then attended the Clarion Writers\u2019 Workshop in 1999.\nThat same year, Tim Pratt\u2019s stories started showing up: \u201c53rd Annual Mantis Homecoming Dance\u201d in Maelstrom, and \u201cAngel of the Ordinary\u201d in Drabblecast. In 2000 he had the poem \u201cVisions\u201d in Star*Line; plus more short fiction publications, including \u201cThe Fallen and the Muse of the Street\u201d in Strange Horizons. Once his writing career had started, Pratt never stopped; instead, he cranked into high gear, continually putting out fiction (usually multiple pieces every year) and poetry.\nBy 2002, Pratt was appearing in readers\u2019 polls and earning major awards nominations. To date, he has appeared on ballots and short lists for the Sturgeon, Stoker, Nebula, World Fantasy, and much more. \u201cSoul Searching,\u201d a poem published in Strange Horizons in 2004, won a Rhysling Award, and short story \u201cImpossible Dreams\u201d in the July 2006 Asimov\u2019s won their Readers\u2019 Poll and earned Pratt a Hugo Award for Best Short Story.\nMeanwhile, Pratt also edited Star*Line from 2002 to 2004 and coedited Flytrap with his wife Heather Shaw from 2003\u20132008. He also edited reprint anthology, Sympathy for the Devil, and coedited original anthology Rags and Bones with Melissa Marr.\nFor most folks, this would be more than enough to keep them busy. But Pratt\u2019s \u201chigh gear\u201d is a world apart. Already an accomplished and prolific short story author and poet, as well as a respected editor, in 2005 Pratt came out with debut novel, The Strange Adventures of Rangergirl, with Bantam Spectra. His first novel was a Mythopoeic Award finalist and won the Emperor Norton Award for best Bay area novel.\nAs T.A. Pratt, his urban fantasy series with \u201cass-kicking sorcerer\u201d Marla Mason hit shelves in 2007, beginning with Blood Engines. In 2010 he had science fantasy The Nex; he had contemporary fantasy Briarpatch in 2011; and \u201cgonzo historical\u201d The Constantine Affliction in 2012\u2014written under the name T. Aaron Payton; plus novella The Deep Woods with PS Publishing in 2014. He has also written gaming tie-ins for Forgotten Realms, Pathfinder Tales, and more.\nTim Pratt has authored over twenty novels, including a dozen books in the Marla Mason series, the more recent Axiom space opera trilogy (The Wrong Stars, The Dreaming Stars, and 2019\u2019s The Forbidden Stars, published by Angry Robot), plus several collections, including his latest, Miracles & Marvels.\nHe writes a new story every month for patrons at www.patreon.com/timpratt and continues to sell short fiction professionally. His newest book is The Fractured Void, a media tie-in for the Twilight Imperium game. His upcoming novel is Doors of Sleep, due from Angry Robot in January of 2021. Tim Pratt lives and writes buckets and buckets of words in Berkeley, CA, with his wife and their son, River. He even occasionally collaborates with family, saying, \u201cMy son and I designed a fun fast science fiction card game, and are in the process of making it pretty (had to commission a lot of art).\u201d\nIf ISFDB is to be believed, your first stories came out in 1999. Not only do you have an incredible amount of work out, but you have so many different kinds of work, spanning two decades. You also have upcoming books with various publishers, plus your short story exclusives on Patreon. What does it take to stay in the game for so long and to sustain a career?\nIt\u2019s true! My first story was a nasty little piece of horror in a stapled \u2019zine called Maelstrom SF, edited by Dave Felts. From small acorns grow modestly sized oaks, etc.\nAs for the secret to my longevity, I just . . . like writing. I always wrote a lot. I started writing fiction steadily when I was in second or third grade and just never stopped. If all the markets suddenly stopped buying my work, I would still write it. (I would admittedly revise a lot less, and as for proofreading, pfft, never again.) If I didn\u2019t enjoy writing, I would stop; take away the element of fun and challenge and experimentation, and frankly, there are other endeavors with a higher ratio of return to effort. Written fiction is just my favorite art form. Certainly, there are aspects of the profession I find less fun or interesting or rewarding, but it\u2019s worth doing them to get all the parts I do like.\nOn a professional level, there are two other crucial elements for longevity, which I\u2019d call \u201cdon\u2019t be precious\u201d and \u201ctry stuff.\u201d I debuted pretty strong, sold five books to Bantam in like a year and a half or something, and then publishing had its great collapse in 2008 and I was suddenly out of contract and couldn\u2019t sell to a major publisher. Other people in that position quit writing, or quit doing it professionally. But I decided I shouldn\u2019t be precious. I took on interesting work-for-hire gigs that would teach me things instead; how to write for kids, how to write sword-and-sorcery, how to write satire, etc. For original work, I went to the small press. My feeling is, if you can\u2019t sell out arenas anymore, there\u2019s no shame in playing small clubs for your devoted fans.\nBeing willing to innovate went right along with that. If I\u2019d kept getting good advances from major publishers, I wouldn\u2019t have experimented so much, but I explored crowdfunding and self-publishing with great success. I did the Patreon thing so I could focus on stories more. I edited anthologies. I expanded my sense of what my career could be. When urban fantasy was waning commercially, I thought, that\u2019s fine; I like doing other stuff, too. I like space opera, so I wrote some space opera, and my career had a nice little renaissance. Don\u2019t be precious. If something isn\u2019t working, try something else. Play for the love of the game.\nYou moved around quite a bit as a kid. And now you have Doors of Sleep coming up, where Zax is constantly on the move, against his will, jumping from world to world. Do you feel like moving had any kind of impact on you that shows up in your fiction?\nHmm, most of the moving around was before I was particularly self-aware. My mom was eighteen when I was born and a single mom, and we rambled all over the south mostly (some Missouri and Texas too), but we settled in North Carolina when I was five or six, so it felt pretty stable. (A lot of my deep psychological wiring certainly comes from those formative years, but I don\u2019t remember much.) I always liked road trips, though, and love seeing new places. When I went to college, I moved about as far as I could while keeping in-state tuition, to the mountains of North Carolina, where they had this weird stuff called \u201csnow.\u201d After college I loaded up and drove across the country to California to see what was up out here. I honestly expected to be more itinerant than I am, but I met my wife, had a kid, got a job I liked at Locus instead of the succession of crap-jobs-while-writing-on-the-side I\u2019d envisioned, and put down roots. (When my kid graduates high school, I may do some more rambling, but he\u2019s only a teen so it\u2019ll be a while.)\nDoors of Sleep is written as a series of journal entries relaying the story of Zax\u2019s travels. Did you experiment with perspective and land on this style as the best for the story, or was the book conceived with this style in mind?\nI started writing about Zax a few years ago in stories for my Patreon, and though the character changed a lot between the stories and the novel, they were always first person. The literal journal aspect came later, and I chose it for the book because it allowed me to play with point of view (my favorite thing!) by having other people take up the story and write in Zax\u2019s journal occasionally. I was also inspired by various other travelogues, written in the first person; I love Bill Bryson\u2019s various accounts of his journeys, and Jerome K. Jerome\u2019s fiction/memoir hybrid Three Men in a Boat is a longtime favorite.\nWhat are the advantages and the challenges of this approach, and how did you deal with the challenges?\nWith a diary format you\u2019re not even inside a character\u2019s head; you\u2019re reading the things that character chooses to write down, which is a challenge and an advantage. Unreliable narration is always a treat; Zax tries to be pretty honest, but like anyone, he emphasizes some things and elides others. The big limitation is that you\u2019re stuck with just a single point of view, but of course, I cheated and had other people write stuff down in his journal for various reasons a couple of times in the novel. It\u2019s a format that\u2019s great for building suspense, because the character can say, \u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d and any experienced reader of fiction will know it won\u2019t work out that way.\nWhile Doors of Sleep has this fantastical/wonder element to it, with a dazzle of tons of efficiently sketched worlds, there are also horror elements, and the suspense of the chase. The Zax and companion dynamic reminds me of Doctor Who, but through a journey that adds a dash of Rick and Morty. What is the heart of the story for you, what do you want people to know about this book?\nMy agent read the synopsis and said, \u201cIt\u2019s like Doctor Who combined with Quantum Leap,\u201d which is a good comp, if alas a bit dated. (I did like Quantum Leap when I was a kid.)\nFor me, the heart of things is Zax and his desire for connection, when he has a condition that makes lasting connection almost impossible. There\u2019s a reason I started the story with him finding Minna as a companion, instead of writing about one of the other companions he lost or who chose to leave him; she wants to stick by him, and sees him as more than a ticket to a better life. Minna values Zax on his own merits, and he was so desperate for that. And later they\u2019re joined by Vicki, who just hungers for knowledge and new information, and traveling with Zax is a perfect way to get a never-ending stream of new data. Zax gets to be not so alone, for a while at least, but there\u2019s always the constant danger of being separated from them forever, which is a nice drumbeat of suspense.\nSometimes new writers will ask \u201chow do you know who your main character should be,\u201d and one traditional answer is, \u201cwhoever would suffer the most,\u201d and that\u2019s Zax: trained as a harmonizer, a sort of social worker, he does his best to help people and make meaningful connections, but he always has to leave, so he never knows if he made a lasting difference. He\u2019s a character who is lucky to ever get beyond the lowest tier on the hierarchy of needs, and even attaining that tier is a frequent challenge.\nFelix, the protagonist in The Fractured Void, starts out in a very different situation: he\u2019s been rewarded with command of a ship, but punished by being shoved off to a region of space that is ostensibly boring. How would you compare Felix and Zax\u2014and in what ways do you relate to them most?\nThey\u2019re pretty different! Felix\u2019s big flaw is that he acts too impulsively and doesn\u2019t think consequences through as much as he should. I punish him in this novel by giving him what he wants: excitement, real responsibility, a challenging mission . . . and it\u2019s mostly awful and painful and dangerous. He\u2019s also pathologically self-confident and happy to solve problems with violence, whereas Zax does his very best to eschew violent solutions. What they have in common is a deep affection for their friends and the understanding that you do better as a team than you do going it alone.\nWill readers who loved the Axiom books find The Fractured Void just as tasty? Are there important similarities that will delight fans; or is it really speaking to a different audience?\nI got the gig writing The Fractured Void because of the Axiom books, so probably! It\u2019s a tie-in to the legendary Twilight Imperium strategy board game, a brain-meltingly complex space opera world with lots of alien species and cultures and multiple overlapping axes of conflict. Editor Marc Gascoigne is the one who bought the first Axiom novel when he was at Angry Robot, and when he moved over to Aconyte and took on the Twilight Imperium project, he thought of me. (He says \u201cwhen he jotted down T IMP my handwriting rendered it as TIM P so it was obviously a sign from the heavens.\u201d) There\u2019s certainly the same sense of found family I have in the Axiom books, and banter, and snark. The antagonists in The Fractured Void are more sympathetic than the Axiom or their allies (who are just super awful, because writing villains like that is fun sometimes). In fact, my favorite characters in the book are the duo who pursue Felix: Severyne and Azad, operatives from rival polities forced to work together against a common enemy, who develop a really great frenemy vibe.\nAre the Axiom books really over, or do you have more fiction planned for that universe?\nI wanted to wrap up the main story in a trilogy, but I didn\u2019t tell all the stories I had in that world. I did a Kickstarter for a collection called The Alien Stars, and that\u2019s coming out in the near future: It\u2019s three novellas, each about a character from the original trilogy who didn\u2019t get sufficient time to shine, in my opinion: the cyborg engineer Ashok, the alien Lantern, and the artificial intelligence Shall. The novellas turned out really well. I\u2019m super happy with them and was so glad to return to that world.\nWe see a number of creatives utilizing Patreon and similar platforms to generate income and perhaps even to make the most of their creative property. Is Patreon a good model for most authors, is it the future of publishing? Or is it a platform some will find hard to utilize to significant effect?\nThe mantra of all freelancers should be \u201cmultiple revenue streams.\u201d Patreon is one of my many streams. Some people make a living from Patreon, but I couldn\u2019t; I guess I\u2019m a Patreon mid-lister, pulling in $700 or so a month (sometimes more, sometimes less, but I\u2019ve been doing it for five and a half years and it\u2019s pretty stable now). That\u2019s not at all bad for a short story, especially since I sell some of them as reprints later. I started the Patreon less for money than for art (though I like money); I love short fiction, but wasn\u2019t writing much because novels had taken over, and I knew if I promised people a story every month, I\u2019d re-center short fiction in my creative life. That\u2019s been awesome. I don\u2019t think stuff like this is necessarily the future, but it\u2019s part of a future.\nAs for whether it\u2019s good for other authors . . . if you have a readership already, and want to commit to an ongoing thing, for sure. You can\u2019t crowdfund without a crowd. If no one is listening, it doesn\u2019t matter how beautifully you sing, you know? I had the advantage of a proven track record quality-wise as a short fiction writer, and I\u2019d done a lot of crowdfunding in the past, so I also had an audience that trusted me to deliver what I promised. (I haven\u2019t missed a month yet! Though a couple of them were squeakers. I keep thinking I should write a bunch of extra stories to have in inventory in case of disaster, but I keep not doing that.)\nMy friend Toby Buckell says crowdfunding is a three-legged stool. I\u2019m just gonna quote him. There\u2019s \u201ca leg of having a strong social media presence and profile. A leg of haven proven that you can deliver on the project and have delivered in the past. And lastly, a leg of a project that is compelling in and of itself.\u201d Ideally you have all three. I did, though a couple of the legs were maybe shakier. If you do, yeah, go for it. If you have two of them and they\u2019re really strong, go for it then too. Otherwise, could be hard.\nOne of your recent Patreon stories, \u201cLast Halloween,\u201d is a horror short featuring a young woman who revisits some of the most terrible moments of her life. What is the allure of horror for you, and what makes a great piece of horror fiction?\nOne of the things that interests me as a writer is exploring how characters react psychologically to extreme circumstances, and terror and dread elicit such reactions. I also just love monsters and creepy shit and nightmare logic and the sense of reality coming apart underneath you. That stuff appeals to me on a very basic level that resists any kind of explanation or analysis. The horror stories I love best are the ones where there\u2019s a sense of dread that gradually builds and then there\u2019s a snap at the end. (Ray Vukcevich\u2019s \u201cWhisper\u201d is one of my favorite horror stories, right up there with Kelly Link\u2019s \u201cMonster.\u201d)\nI also like horror that\u2019s rooted in the character\u2019s experience, past, or personality. Not necessarily in the sense that they brought it on themselves, just that their horror experience connects somehow psychologically to their personal circumstances. I do enjoy the school of horror where bad stuff comes out of nowhere and characters just have to deal\u2014that\u2019s a lot of Stephen King\u2019s work, and he was the first horror writer I ever read\u2014because that\u2019s life; you get natural disasters, you get cancer, you get run over, life turns on you. But even in those cases, I want the way the character reacts to be unusual in some way because that reaction is informed by their past and personality. Horror where a sort of generic every-person runs away from a monster doesn\u2019t work for me. The monster should never be more interesting than the person they\u2019re trying to eat.\nWhat do you consider to be some of the best horror you ever wrote, and why?\nI did one on my Patreon called \u201cThrough the Woods\u201d that I like a lot, with a kind of classic premise: dysfunctional couple have a car break down in the woods on the way to Thanksgiving and bad stuff happens and hard choices have to be made. I had another called \u201cFool\u2019s Fire\u201d in PseudoPod about the dark gods of the GPS, the successors to will-o\u2019-the-wisps who use to lead people to their deaths in the woods; now they\u2019re the ones who trick people into driving off bridges or into lakes or down dead-end streets in bad parts of town. Probably the best one I\u2019ve written in years was \u201cSometimes You Get the Bear,\u201d set in a world where, whenever a person is about to die of any cause at all, a giant spectral cave bear comes and kills them. Then a guy decides to go on a bear hunt to kill death. That\u2019s in my collection Miracles & Marvels.\nLooking at your short fiction, which are the stories that stand out most for you, which are most important to you, and why?\n\u201cLittle Gods\u201d started my career in a lot of ways; it was a Nebula finalist (thanks, short fiction jury!) and was the title piece of my debut collection. \u201cHart and Boot\u201d was in The Best American Short Stories 2005 (thanks, Michael Chabon!), and that didn\u2019t hurt; it was the title piece in my second collection. \u201cImpossible Dreams\u201d won a Hugo (thanks, Hugo voters!). That\u2019s probably the holy triumvirate in terms of influence on my career, being reprinted a bunch, etc.\nMore personally, I love my story \u201cCup and Table\u201d from Twenty Epics and reprinted at PodCastle, because it was challenging structurally, and I totally nailed the ending. \u201cAnother End of the Empire\u201d at Strange Horizons is the only story I\u2019ve written that came out on the page exactly the way I saw it in my head. \u201cHappy Old Year\u201d at Drabblecast is my homage to Twilight Zone stories, so I was super happy when Benjamin DeHart made it into short film The New Year.\nWhat are some of your favorite pieces reserved for your Patreon folks, and what do you like about those pieces?\nI put most of my very favorites in Miracles & Marvels last year. From this year, \u201cBeneath a Black Moon\u201d is a story about gardening and transcendence and I think it turned out really well; I read Susanna Clarke\u2019s awesome Piranesi and started thinking about occult practitioners and that story bubbled up. (It doesn\u2019t have much in common with Piranesi besides those occult concerns, but those are the best inspirations, when you can\u2019t even see a clear connection, I think.)\n\u201cRevenance\u201d is really cool; it\u2019s your classic horror story about someone who gets killed in a hit-and-run and returns as a spirit to exact revenge on the driver, but my spirit has ethical and moral concerns about murdering the person who killed him. \u201cThe Bodies\u201d is about a guy who finds a dead body . . . and then another dead body another day . . . and then another . . . until it\u2019s clear something supernatural is up; that came from a conversation with my friend (and author! Her debut story is coming from PseudoPod next year!), Sarah Day, about people we knew of who\u2019d discovered dead people (or in one case, a head) and how it messed them up.\nHuh. Those are all horror stories. Why am I so focused on horror stories in this pandemic election year. Who can say.\nWhat else are you working on, what else do you have coming up that you\u2019d like readers to know about?\n*quiet sobbing* I have a lot of deadlines. When I get anxious, I take on extra work, because it gives me a sense of control; you\u2019d think knowing this about myself psychologically would allow me to do something about it, but no. A while back I decided to write four books by Fall 2021. One of them is done (The Alien Stars), one is in process (the second Twilight Imperium novel, The Necropolis Empire), and the other two will happen: a sequel to The Doors of Sleep and a project that cannot yet be confirmed but nevertheless looms before me. (It\u2019s fine, actually, I sat down with a calendar and worked it all out, there\u2019s enough time. The key is to not have any hobbies.) Oh, and my wife Heather Shaw and I are doing our traditional winter holiday collaborative story for PodCastle again this year!

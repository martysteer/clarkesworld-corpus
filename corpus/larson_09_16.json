She startled; the hairpin she\u2019d been using slipped into the wrong socket and her spidery metal hand flailed wild. Staticky pain flared through her arm and shoulder and made her hiss.\nShe yanked the pin out and pinched her arm shut until the polymer resealed. Flexed her fingers, pulled on her black driving gloves. Gritted her teeth as whoever it was kept on hammering at her opaqued window.\nEris switched it transparent and sound porous. The man on the other side was wearing a charcoal gray suit with haute couture slashes through the fabric, and he was running one finger along the wriggling green vines some shitty graffiti artist had sprayed onto her side door earlier that week.\n\u201cCunt, don\u2019t touch my cab,\u201d she said.\nHe looked up, showing a gaunt symmetrical face with icy blue eyes that glowed a bit, meaning Optiks. He grinned unnervingly white teeth.\n\u201cI need a ride,\u201d he said, probably thinking he could jerk her around because she was young and he was handsome. The haircut was the only thing that didn\u2019t match up\u2014buzzed down to stubble all over, instead of the long prehensile locks so in style for well-monied assholes.\n\u201cThe little orange light means busy,\u201d Eris said. \u201cTry the ones with little green lights. I know it\u2019s confusing if you\u2019ve never used a cab before, or if you\u2019re a shithead.\u201d\nIn response, the man held up his sleek black tab and a non-refundable five hundred credit transfer marched across his screen onto the cab\u2019s onboard. The digital chime sent dopamine down Eris\u2019s spinal column. About ten times the going rate for even a cross-quadrant ride. Maybe when you were rich enough you lost track of that kind of thing. That much money, she could get some fresh artinerves for her arm and maybe even get the ugly green graffiti scrubbed off her side door.\nEris grudgingly switched her busy light off. \u201cWhere to, sir?\u201d she asked, as the man climbed into the back seat.\n\u201cLower streets,\u201d he said, adjusting his lapels. \u201cI\u2019ll direct as we go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d prefer a sataddress, sir,\u201d Eris said, slipping her hands into the cab\u2019s modified control sleeves. The engine hummed in response.\n\u201cAlso, there will be a few people trying to follow us,\u201d the man continued, ignoring her. \u201cI hope that\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\n\u201cYou clowning?\u201d Eris demanded. She checked her cams. Back along Pier 17, through the file of waiting black-and-yellow cabs, she saw the hulking shape of a silver-colored private upcar drifting towards them. It didn\u2019t have any distinguishing holos.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not sweepers,\u201d the man in her back seat said. \u201cJust overly curious individuals. Nothing unwholesome is happening here. All I need is for you to drive quickly and skillfully. I assumed from the customized chassis you can do that.\u201d\nEris tongued the gap in her molars. The feedback spikes in her bad arm were getting more painful and coming more often, and turning it off left her clumsy as shit. New artinerves would make things a lot better.\nAlso she hadn\u2019t done anything stupid in a long time, and it had been building under her skin like an itch.\n\u201cDump another five hundred on me, I can drive better than anyone you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she said, shooting for the moon.\n\u201cAnother five hundred,\u201d the man said, winking one electric blue eye, \u201cwhen we get there.\u201d\nShe pulled them up off the pier, climbing into the dull yellow sky. The City stretched around them in all directions. Up, especially. Behemoth technicolored towers, rotating apartment blocks, sky tunnels that scythed and retracted in accordance with traffic patterns. Eris rose leisurely through a swarm of drones. In her underbelly cam, she watched the silver upcar follow suit.\n\u201cLower streets, I said.\u201d The man\u2019s voice had a hint of annoyance now. His eyes were scrolling code. There was a lick of sweat on his hairline.\n\u201cI heard,\u201d Eris said, letting the silver upcar close the gap a bit more. \u201cDon\u2019t toss up back there, alright?\u201d\nBefore the man could reply, she dove.\nDown. Eris felt the G-force all the way up her arms, singing through the artinerves, and she felt it in her gut. They plunged past the silver upcar; through the blur she saw a startled silhouette recoiling. The drones and anything with avoidance AI scattered. Eris dealt with the others herself, slaloming between two unwary drivers, swooping under a freighter. She had her own proximity alert silenced, but the other vehicles made angry wails as she hurtled past.\nThe silver upcar was only caught off-guard for a moment, then it dropped hard after them, a dive so steep Eris knew it had to be manual. She gunned the engine. A sky tunnel was extending below them, flexing into the air like a gigantic worm. A dock slid out from the adjacent building to meet it. There wasn\u2019t going to be much of a gap.\nShe took it, twisting to fit, feeling the magnets of the dock sizzle through the cab\u2019s onboard, up her arm. The sky tunnel slammed into its dock and sheared the air where her bumper had been a microsecond before, but they were through.\nThe silver upcar braked, angling to get around the tunnel. But by then Eris was away, spiraling into the traffic again, her heart pounding against her ribs. She checked the mirror. The passenger was flung back in his seat, howling. No\u2014laughing. Somehow it made her like him a little more.\nShe headed for the lower streets.\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d Eris squinted down the alleyway.\nThey\u2019d gone about as low as she ever did, into the City\u2019s underbelly, and now were facing a grimy quickcrete alley splashed with animated graffiti. She couldn\u2019t make out the words, but the lime green color was familiar. She had some countermeasures keyed up and ready to go in case a bunch of hoodlums suddenly spilled out to vivisect her cab.\n\u201cThis is it,\u201d her passenger confirmed. Once they\u2019d shaken off the upcar, he\u2019d gone back to his Optiks, muttering sub-vocals and blinking owlishly like any other boring businessman. It was sort of comforting, considering their strange destination.\nWhen he unrolled his tab and sent another five hundred across, the money made Eris feel momentarily affectionate.\n\u201cMaybe dim those eyes of yours,\u201d she suggested, triggering the door open. \u201cAround here, they\u2019ll take them out with a spoon.\u201d\n\u201cAround here, maybe, but not here,\u201d the man said, flashing all his white teeth again. He made to climb out, then paused. His sleeve whirred, and a custom calling card, wafer-thin, spat out into his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re a good driver,\u201d he said. \u201cI might need that again.\u201d He set the filigreed black card down delicately on the cushion. \u201cThanks for the ride.\u201d\nThen he was off into the alley, disappearing into the shadows. The graffiti wriggled the other way, startled, and Eris could finally read it. The green man cometh. Whatever the fuck that meant.\nShe looked at her screen again, at the easiest gee of credit she\u2019d ever made, and grinned. She could take the rest of the day off if she wanted.\nShe wanted. Eris switched her orange light on, then lifted off and headed for home, which was a low slot in a grease-yellow honeycomb of converted storage units\u2014and not the chic faux-po\u2019 variety. But it had a good dock for her cab, and it was cheap. And compared to how she\u2019d grown up, it was luxury.\nEris did the math in her head as she drove, slicing the Guild fees off the top and figuring out how much she would put away. She only remembered the calling card in her back seat as her cab snicked gently into its moorings. If he overpaid like that every time, it was worth holding onto. She dropped the partition and plucked it off the cushion, careful not to crush it.\nShe swung herself over the whistling gap in the dock\u2019s metal floor and pushed her thumb to the apartment door. It tasted her genes and shuttered open, but the lights didn\u2019t turn on as she stepped inside. She whistled a low activation note. Still nothing.\nSomething was wrong. Her heart leapt up her throat. The apartment was small enough that she could tell there were extra bodies inside, she could hear weight shifting, breath in and breath out. She felt an angry buzz through her prosthetics, biofeedback from the adrenaline. The left one spasmed; she had to grab and hold it with her right until it stilled.\nFeeling the polymer muscle reminded her she had a little canister of stunspray tucked inside it. Eris moved slowly around the corner of the divider that separated the bathroom out from the rest of the apartment, her heart pounding.\nTwo people were waiting in the gloom, one of them draped on the side of the couch without laundry all over it, the other perched awkwardly on her orthochair, which was shifting all around trying to accommodate the unfamiliar body.\n\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing in my house?\u201d she demanded.\nThe lights finally snapped on in response to her voice, and she got a good look at the intruders. The woman on the couch was tall and vaguely leonine, with heavy-lidded eyes and blocky cheekbones. Her black jacket was cut in a way that displayed both her long sinewy arms.\nThe man on the orthochair was smaller, also wearing black, and he didn\u2019t have a face. Instead, the space above his neck was a rippling wash of pixels that hurt Eris\u2019s eyes to stare at directly.\n\u201cWe got a scan on your cab before you shook us,\u201d the man said, in a voice stripped electronically of any identifying characteristics. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting. Agents Ndirangu and Kit of the OCI. Arms out, please, Eris.\u201d\nHer first instinct was to call bullshit and feed them the whole canister of stunspray. People told stories about Operative City Intelligence the way they told stories about the bogeyman. But facial blurs weren\u2019t something you could just pick up at the fabshop, and there was something else, too. Something the passenger had said. Not sweepers, just Overly Curious Individuals.\n\u201cThat asshole,\u201d she breathed, raising her arms.\nEris gritted her teeth while the woman called Kit searched her, first by scan\u2014there was a familiar tingle as it noticed the first prosthetic, a bit of surprise on Kit\u2019s face when it found the second\u2014and then by hand. Eris hadn\u2019t been frisked for a long time. Turned out she still hated it.\nKit slipped the calling card from Eris\u2019s pocket, held it pinched between two sharp-looking fingernails for a closer look, then slid it into a Faraday pouch.\n\u201cYou can keep the stunner,\u201d she said, in a slightly gravelly voice that was younger than Eris had been expecting. \u201cJust don\u2019t do anything stupid with it.\u201d\nShe stepped backward with a languid smile, which Eris did not return. The man, Ndirangu, had given up on the orthochair and was standing now as well. Eris knew she was in huge shit. Had to be. She\u2019d probably just abetted an organ smuggler or contract killer or some such.\n\u201cFirst question,\u201d Ndirangu said tonelessly. \u201cWhat do you know about the Green Man?\u201d\n\u201cFuck all?\u201d she said back. \u201cLook, I just drove him. I didn\u2019t know who he was, didn\u2019t know who you were. He said you weren\u2019t sweepers.\u201d\n\u201cTechnically correct, although our work does occasionally overlap with City Law Enforcement,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cSecond question. What do you know about Ferris Carrow?\u201d\nHe raised one smartgloved hand, and a holo bloomed to life on the wall, showing an image of an unsmiling woman with a surgically-ageless face, her silver-blonde hair sheared to professional spikes. Eris folded her arms, and in her peripheral she noticed Kit mirror the motion.\n\u201cDon\u2019t know her,\u201d Eris said. \u201cShould I?\u201d\n\u201cFerris Carrow owned half the filtration plants in the City, and a quarter of its fabbing industry,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cVery wealthy, quite influential. She was murdered three days ago.\u201d\nEris felt her knees go weak and watery. \u201cYou think I had something to do with a murder?\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cWe think the man you helped evade us did.\u201d The holo shifted, and now it showed Eris\u2019s mysterious passenger, high-angle, stepping into her cab. \u201cArno Schorr,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cA philanthropist, businessman, and one of the founders of a doomsday cult. The Church of the Green Man.\u201d\n\u201cNever heard of it,\u201d Eris said, trying to figure out where his eyes were so she could meet them, so he would know she meant it.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to get religion licensing for the past couple months.\u201d Ndirangu gave a stiff shrug that might have been annoyance. \u201cBefore her death, Ferris Carrow appeared to have taken an interest. Basic doctrine is rejection of personal technology. Nature worship centered on a singular deity. A mishmash of Pagan and Luddite with ties to the Neoprimitive movement.\u201d\nThe penultimate word made Eris\u2019s eyes narrow. Her City basic had no trace of colony accent left, and she told anyone who asked that she\u2019d been born in the lower streets. But this was the OCI. The OCI knew things.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pick where I was born,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cThey shipped me out of the Neoprim colony when I was a kid. I\u2019ve never gone back. I don\u2019t have any fucking ties to it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m aware,\u201d Ndirangu said calmly. \u201cAnd there\u2019s really only one tenet of the Church of the Green Man we find worrisome. They\u2019re extinctionist.\u201d\n\u201cExtinctionist?\u201d Eris tried to make her voice even again. She didn\u2019t like being reminded about the colony. Those were memories she kept in cold storage.\n\u201cThey think it would be best for the planet if we all died off,\u201d Kit said darkly.\nEris crinkled an eyebrow. \u201cDoes anyone not think that?\u201d\n\u201cThe difference is, they\u2019d like to do something about it,\u201d Ndirangu said. He waved his hand and the holo shifted to a sprawling green graffiti on corroded metal wall. He read it aloud. \u201cHumans are a virus, City is its last bastion. The Calamities were not enough to clean the world. But fear not, the Green Man cometh.\u201d He paused. \u201cAt first we didn\u2019t take it particularly seriously. Criminal mischief, nothing more. Then Ferris Carrow was found like this.\u201d\nThe holo churned and Eris\u2019s stomach churned with it. The same woman, but lying on her back, now, with dark congealed cuts laddered up her legs and her stomach blown open. Someone had packed the exit wound with dirt, and out of the middle a little red flower was blooming.\nEris swallowed back bile. \u201cFuck,\u201d she said. \u201cFuck, switch that off. You think I had anything to do with that, you\u2019re insane.\u201d\n\u201cWe know you didn\u2019t, Eris,\u201d Ndirangu said tonelessly, turning his glove\u2019s holo off. Eris felt a wave of relief that cut short at his next words. \u201cWe just want you to have an understanding of the gravity of the situation before you sign this waiver.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of waiver?\u201d she asked. Kit was staring at her again, her arms, her legs. She had a bad feeling in her gut.\n\u201cSchorr is going to need to transport something soon,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cSomething we believe he smuggled out of the colonies on his most recent visit. We don\u2019t know what, exactly. But it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll call on your services. You were impressive.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve done better,\u201d she said on automatic.\nAnother snort from Kit. Ndirangu didn\u2019t react. Or maybe he did. Who knew?\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use you to get to Schorr. Gain his trust.\u201d\nEris blinked. \u201cWhat, so I\u2019m a spy now? I drive a cab. I\u2019m not up on espionage. And I don\u2019t want anything to do with a fucking murder cult, anyways, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t dream of using an untrained citizen,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cNo, you\u2019ll simply be along for the ride. Agent Kit will be doing all the work.\u201d He held up his left hand and the smartglove\u2019s palm turned white, with minute black text scrolling across it. \u201cThis is a basic waiver for use of your body in the event of an OCI operation. All it needs is your geneprint.\u201d\nKit moved a thick strand of hair away from her temple and Eris saw the glinting neural link clinging there like a beetle. The way she\u2019d been staring, the way she\u2019d been mimicking, made sense all of a sudden.\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Eris said. \u201cI don\u2019t do that brainshare shit. I don\u2019t want anyone in my head but me.\u201d\n\u201cBrainshare is a bit of a misnomer,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cThe waiver states clearly that we\u2019ll have control of your central nervous system, but no access to your thoughts or memories. That all remains quite safe, and quite private.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her in my body, either,\u201d Eris snapped, giving Kit a side-eye. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with this. Just bill me for the traffic violations, okay? Just go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid this is more important than what you do or do not want,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cIf you sign the waiver, you\u2019ll be fully insured for any injuries occurring to your body. And once the OCI operation is deemed complete, you\u2019ll be compensated for your time, as well.\u201d He reached underneath the orthochair and pulled out a sleek black carry-case Eris hadn\u2019t noticed before. \u201cIf you don\u2019t sign, we may have to . . . investigate you.\u201d\n\u201cFor what?\u201d Eris demanded.\n\u201cSchorr chose your cab because it had the Green Man tag on it,\u201d Kit said coolly.\n\u201cSomeone did those vines last week while I was docking,\u201d Eris protested. \u201cI\u2019d never paint up my own cab.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe the OCI is willing to chalk that up to coincidence,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cBut the fact that you were born in a Neoprim colony may be one coincidence too many. It might warrant surveillance. Which might have a negative impact on your livelihood.\u201d\nEris\u2019s mind whirred in circles. She should never have let that asshole into her cab. If she didn\u2019t sign the waiver, she would be trying to drive through a swarm of follow-cams for the rest of her life, or worse. In the stories, people who pissed off the OCI eventually just disappeared. Kit could have definitely disappeared a few people, judging from the stare on her.\nAnd that was who she was supposed to brainshare with. Eris tongued the gap between her molars. The stupid decisions were piling up now, but it wasn\u2019t like she had much of a choice.\n\u201cI want to get ghosted on all traffic cams,\u201d she said. \u201cNo violation notices for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\u201cI think we could arrange something like that,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cThis is, after all, rather important.\u201d He put out his left hand. Eris figured he was lying about the traffic cams, but she\u2019d mostly said it to save some dignity, which he was letting her have. She could bet Kit wouldn\u2019t have.\nEris spat on her hand to ensure a DNA reading, then shook. The smartglove rasped against her skin like a cat\u2019s tongue, then chimed an affirmative.\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Ndirangu said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get right to inserting the implant.\u201d\nThe sleek black rectangle unfolded on spidery limbs, and Eris realized it wasn\u2019t a carry-case. It was an autosurgeon. A shudder ran all the way through her.\n\u201cWait,\u201d she said, her mouth feeling suddenly thick and warm. \u201cHere?\u201d\n\u201cHere, yes,\u201d Ndirangu said, his voice sounding even more distorted than usual. \u201cThere\u2019s little time to waste. I gave you a dermal sedative through the glove. That\u2019s mentioned in the waiver as well.\u201d\nEris felt the old hospital panic kicking up through her, dulled only halfway by the drug. She backed away and stumbled. Someone caught her\u2014Kit caught her\u2014and lowered her down onto the floor. She felt a pillow slide under her skull, cushioning it. Her whole body was heavy and she could taste copper in the back of her throat. Familiar.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fast,\u201d Kit\u2019s voice said. \u201cYou won\u2019t remember it. I don\u2019t.\u201d\nThen the autosurgeon was spreading overtop of her, reaching with calipers and braces, clicking and sliding. Too familiar, too familiar. Before the prostheses, they\u2019d tried twice to grow her arms, but the surgery always failed. The flesh never took.\nShe squeezed her eyes shut.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t have to spring the sedative on her,\u201d Kit\u2019s voice came faint, accusing. \u201cCould have just told her.\u201d\n\u201cNot with her profile,\u201d came Ndirangu\u2019s, but different now, free of the mask. \u201cShe\u2019s not as tough as she thinks she is.\u201d\nEris wanted to say yes I am, yes I fucking am, but she wasn\u2019t sure and her mouth was too numb and her whole body was turning rubbery and\u2014\nEris woke up doing calisthenics in her empty apartment. She could see her reflection in the dulled smartglass window across from her, bending and stretching. The display told her it was morning, nearly ten o\u2019clock.\n\u201cWhat the shit?\u201d she demanded, or tried to. What came out was a strange slur through clamped jaws. Then her mouth opened without her and spoke back.\n\u201cSorry. Just getting calibrated.\u201d The voice was hers, she could feel it rumble in her chest, but it wasn\u2019t hers at all. \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute.\u201d\nIt all came back like a tsunami. The man with the shaved head and slashed suit, the one thousand credits, the black-clad OCI agents waiting for her in the dark. Doomsday cults and a dead woman with a flower in her gut. The last thing she remembered was putting her signature on some kind of a waiver.\nOn a brainshare waiver. That was why she couldn\u2019t move her own muscles\u2014Kit was moving them.\nFuck that. She tried to wrench her right arm down and away, abandoning the stupid yoga pose.\nShe got nothing. Not even a twitch.\n\u201cYou can have your mouth back while I finish up,\u201d Kit said.\nA weird tremor went through Eris\u2019s tongue. She spat, like she was getting a bad taste out, but somehow managed to slobber it down her chin. Her reflection in the window was drooly and dazed-looking.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the implant?\u201d she said.\nThis time the reply came in Kit\u2019s voice, slightly raspy, thrumming through Eris\u2019s head. Subcutaneous. Some skin-spray to cover the scarring. Should be undetectable.\nEris watched with some measure of revulsion as her reflection started doing jumping jacks. This was so fucked.\n\u201cThis is so fucked,\u201d she puffed.\nI\u2019ve been looking at your augments. Really modded the shit out of your arms, didn\u2019t you. Reflexes way past standard. No wonder the artinerves are nearly burned out. No wonder you can drive like that.\nThere was some admiration in her voice, but Eris didn\u2019t want to hear it. She felt sick and angry, imagining Kit sitting on the couch testing her arms out like a new toy or some shit. Like all of her was a toy.\n\u201cYeah, that makes it so worth it,\u201d Eris said. \u201cMaybe I should lop a leg off, too, huh?\u201d\nHer face in the window twitched, which had to be Kit.\nThat\u2019s not what I meant. I meant it was good wire work. That\u2019s all.\n\u201cI could always drive like that,\u201d Eris said. \u201cSo fuck you.\u201d\nThe jumping jacks stopped.\nDone calibrating. Kit, acting like she hadn\u2019t heard the last bit. Not the worst body I\u2019ve had to work with. Just go about your normal routine, if possible, and I\u2019ll be ready to take over when Schorr contacts you.\nSuddenly her muscles were all hers again, and she toppled. She caught onto the edge of the orthochair as she went down; the cantilevers whined and propped her back up. Her wobbly legs turned solid again. She straightened, muttering curses.\n\u201cGo about your normal routine, Eris,\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cIgnore the OCI bitch kicking around in your brain.\u201d\nBut it was a relief to have her body back. And whatever Kit had been doing had actually left her feeling pretty good. Loose, warm. Bit of a sweat on. She put her hands on her hips and surveyed the dull gray cube of her apartment, looking for evidence of the agents\u2019 intrusion, but they\u2019d left everything in its place or not-place.\nA tumble of clean underwear and colorful shirts heaped on the end of the couch, which was also her bed. Work bench in the corner strewn with parts and a coil of conductor wire. On the floor beside a vat of sealant, her dad\u2019s old magnetic chess set that she sometimes hooked to the net when she was feeling masochistic. Canary-yellow scarf, jacket with a stubborn oil stain. Two juggling balls rolling and bumping against the heaped jacket where the third was trapped underneath.\nApart from her cab, it was all she had to show for a decade in the City. It seemed messier and shabbier and shittier knowing Kit and the faceless one had been lounging around in it. Nearly made her want to clean up.\nOver on the kitchenette counter, she saw the filigreed black calling card waiting. She gave it a wide berth as she slid open the fridge. There was nothing floating in the gel but hot sauce and a tube of yogurt. She felt antsy, and hungry now, too. She picked the calling card gingerly off the counter and slid it into her pocket. Maybe Schorr wouldn\u2019t call anyways. Maybe the OCI had wildly miscalculated.\nAs if she could be that lucky. Eris left and locked the door behind her.\n\u201cBet you can do all kinds of nasty things with them.\u201d\nEris was nearly home again, halfway through the corridor from the main hub with a biodegradable bag of groceries slung over her shoulder, when the ragged man who\u2019d been sauntering a few steps behind her spoke. She turned over her shoulder.\n\u201cFuck you say?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d the man replied, but his eyes trailed longingly up Eris\u2019s left arm, which was still twitching sporadically, then the right. His skin was pale, sallow, and his eyes were shot through with pink. Tweaked on something. \u201cJust that you can probably do all kinds of nasty things with those artis of yours, is all.\u201d\nShe would\u2019ve let it go, because tweakers and technophiles weren\u2019t worth the time to spit on, but she was still antsy. Maybe the OCI were watching through her eyes. Maybe they\u2019d sent this fuck as some kind of test. Or maybe Schorr had sent him.\n\u201cAll kinds of things,\u201d the man repeated with a placid smile, reaching to run his fingers over the exposed polymer. She batted them away hard; he blew on them and laughed. \u201cBeauties, them.\u201d\nThat was it. Eris set her groceries down. \u201cThey could tear your tiny fucking prong off if you don\u2019t get lost, cunt.\u201d\nThe man\u2019s smile dissolved. He gave a slow blink, then his face turned angry. \u201cIf you can\u2019t take a compliment, wear skin sleeves on them,\u201d he said.\nHe took a menacing step and Eris stepped back in sync as she checked him over again, trying to guess if what he was on would make him quicker or make him clumsier. The veins in his neck were all taut blue. Could be Taurus, which would be bad news.\nEris wanted smash her knee up into his thickening hard-on and only unload the stunspray if necessary. She didn\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction of touching him with her arms.\nBut she was frozen. A weird thrum was going through her locked-up muscles and she couldn\u2019t move a millimeter. The man took it for fear and his smile came back. He had a nose for blood in the water; he was glancing up and down the empty corridor.\nEris couldn\u2019t even cuss out whatever dumb fucking glitch in the brainshare implant was seizing her up. Her jaws were clenched too hard.\nThe man went to grab her arm, and suddenly she moved.\nToo fast to understand. She felt contact, displaced air, and displaced cartilage, then she was wiping something warm off her forehead while the man wailed on the dirty floor of the corridor. Blood was gushing from his nose and his kneecap was shifted over from where it ought to have been.\nShe\u2019d gone through his grip somehow, done his nose in and crunched his knee and come back up like elastic. She wasn\u2019t even breathing hard. She was a fucking ninja.\n\u201cNext time you\u2019re dead,\u201d she said, feeling wild, feeling dangerous, even as she picked up her smiley-face-decorated grocery bag. \u201cGot it?\u201d\nHe only groaned. Eris headed back to her apartment, riding the adrenaline like a riptide. It took her a moment to realize what had happened.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your fucking help,\u201d she said. \u201cKit? I know that was you, Kit.\u201d\nI know you didn\u2019t need help, came Kit\u2019s gravel voice. That was just for my personal satisfaction. If Ndirangu asks, it was all you.\nEris considered it. Kit didn\u2019t sound like she was lying. She sounded kind of pissed off and pleased at the same time. \u201cAlright,\u201d she said, then, grudgingly, \u201cI guess that was pretty slick. How you did the knee like that.\u201d\nI\u2019ve done better, Kit said, and for a second Eris liked her.\nThen the calling card went off in her pocket.\nKit did the talking, and it surprised Eris how much she managed to sound like her, down to the cursing. Then again, she was a professional and the conversation hadn\u2019t been a long one. Schorr\u2019s distorted voice had requested her for a transport job, vehicle provided, an hour\u2019s work at most, possible pursuers to shake. In exchange, five thousand credits, and none of it going through her cab for the Guild to skim fees off of.\nKit, in Eris\u2019s voice, had agreed, and the calling card had denatured to a handful of gritty black gel that she\u2019d dumped in the nearest recycler. Eris had gone home, eaten and put away groceries, and dipped her arms in sealant to take a shower. She didn\u2019t think Kit would be watching, but she did it without looking down much just in case.\nAnd now, in the growing dusk, she was walking down Pier 24 to the boxy white delivery van that had been left docked exactly as Schorr had described. She\u2019d already stopped at a specific trash receptacle to pull out a smartglove and tiny gun. Eris felt a cold ball of ice in her stomach. She knew that whatever she was transporting was going to be unwholesome. She hoped it wouldn\u2019t be a dead body.\nShe stopped in front of the unmarked van and grimaced. \u201cThat woman, Carrow,\u201d she muttered, picturing her passenger\u2019s icy blue eyes. \u201cWas Schorr the one who killed her?\u201d\nFor a moment there was no reply, and she imagined Kit out getting a tea or something, but then her voice sounded in her skull. He has an alibi. But Ndirangu\u2019s positive he ordered it. Ndirangu\u2019s usually right.\n\u201cWhy\u2019d he have a blur mask and you didn\u2019t?\u201d Eris asked, hoping Kit couldn\u2019t tell she was delaying the inevitable. \u201cYou forget yours?\u201d\nThere was a pause. Haven\u2019t earned it yet. Hopefully this op makes it happen.\n\u201cWait, you\u2019re not some kind of fucking rookie, are you?\u201d Eris demanded. \u201cI thought this Schorr guy was a big deal for the OCI.\u201d\nI was the best match for the brainshare. Kit\u2019s voice sounded slightly miffed. I\u2019m taking over now.\nEris felt the thrum all through her body again. She\u2019d always hated being a passenger and she hated this even more. At least Kit left her her mouth, tingling and thick-feeling but functional.\n\u201cI can drive,\u201d she pointed out.\nLiability issues. We\u2019re now on clock for an official OCI operation. Besides. I can drive, too.\nKit peered inside the van. Eris thought about pointing out the non-standard dampers and a drive stick that would take some adjusting, but Kit seemed to be looking in the right places. Maybe she\u2019d been the one driving the silver upcar yesterday, which now seemed like at least a whole week ago.\nKit walked around the outside of the van next. The back was hermetically-sealed and humming refrigerated. Big fancy lock on it, too, with sliding black flanges and glowing red vents.\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s transporting?\u201d Eris asked.\nNo.\n\u201cYou going to look?\u201d\nDeadman\u2019s lock on there. If I fuck up the whole thing will self-torch. So, no.\n\u201cFair.\u201d\nEris didn\u2019t like not knowing, but there were a lot of things she didn\u2019t like going on.\nShe felt a little dart of satisfaction when Kit nearly bashed them into a wall undocking, not prepared for the upped sensitivity in her arms. But she smoothed things out after a few minutes and then Eris could tell that she was a pretty decent driver, despite the van handling like a blue whale or something else huge and extinct.\nDusk deepened as they drove, and all the City lights were coming alive. The harsh arcs of artificial sunlight, the soft blue-and-purple bioluminescents like bruises, the swirl of neon and argon. The lights were under them and above them and reminded her of the field of stars she\u2019d always had overhead as a kid but didn\u2019t quite measure up.\nThe van\u2019s onboard was programmed to feed directions bit by bit, the same way Schorr had done from her back seat, but it didn\u2019t take long for Eris to figure out they were heading to the same place as last time.\n\u201cTake the under,\u201d she said. \u201cQuicker.\u201d\nKit stayed the course for a second, thinking it through, then grudgingly dipped into Eris\u2019s recommended traffic vector.\nYou know your way around like you were born here.\n\u201cBeen here ten years. Cabbing for five of them.\u201d She paused, then, maybe because of the lights, she spoke again. \u201cSometimes, it feels like I was born here. Feels like New Tenochtitlan was a dream. It\u2019s different over there.\u201d\nYour parents were first-generation emigrants to the colony, it says. Relatively wealthy.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eris said. \u201cWealthy. And they gave it all up to go live in the dirt like the good old days. Gave up their Vaxine and their genetech, too.\u201d\nThere was a long silence. The lights weren\u2019t as beautiful now.\nHow did you lose your arms? Kit finally asked.\nEris ground her teeth. She\u2019d hoped Kit would be one of the people who never bothered asking. \u201cYou know everything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\nYour file doesn\u2019t say.\n\u201cBecause I was born like this.\u201d\nA pause. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\n\u201cNot in the City,\u201d Eris said. \u201cIn the colonies it does. No genetech, remember?\u201d She breathed out a bitter laugh. \u201cMy mom died having me, and my dad sent me away when I was twelve. Thought it would be better for me here. But he stayed. Haven\u2019t spoken to him in years and years.\u201d Something pulled too close for comfort in her peripheral. \u201cGet some fucking space off that,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWe\u2019re wider than you think.\u201d\nHas to be close. I called in a scanner to see what\u2019s in the back.\nThe dull gray upcar pulled even closer to them as they drove, and Eris felt a shivery whine in her teeth as the scan started. She hoped Kit was focused on that and not the old tears building up behind her eyes. She couldn\u2019t move her hands to press them away, but she had enough control of her face for a few hard blinks. She didn\u2019t like thinking about the colony.\n\u201cSo what do we have?\u201d she asked flatly.\nKit didn\u2019t answer for a second. When she did, her voice had an edge to it. Nothing. There\u2019s nothing in the back.\nEris felt the ball of ice again, this time rolling slow down her spine. They were in the lower streets now, deep City, where the lights were old and yellowed and fought a losing battle with the thickening dark. Eris was trying to think of reasons why someone would pay her to transport nothing at all when they arrived at the alleyway.\nKit swung her out of the van. Her shoe crunched on something in the shadows and she was momentarily glad Kit was running things, because if it had been just her she would\u2019ve jumped at the noise like an idiot.\n\u201cGood work.\u201d\nIt was Schorr\u2019s voice. He was standing at the mouth of the alley, hands in his pockets, his electric blue eyes glowing enough to illuminate the bones of his face. Two tall men with the same close-cropped hair were at his shoulders. Eris remembered what Kit had done to the tweaker in the corridor and it made her feel a little better.\n\u201cLet\u2019s have that five thousand now, or I hop back in and drive this shit straight to the sweepers,\u201d Kit said with her mouth. Over the tailored shoulder of Schorr\u2019s suit, Eris saw two more white vans in the alley, identical, and something was being unloaded from the closer of them onto a hoverjack.\nSchorr moved just slightly and her view was blocked. \u201cI\u2019m a man of my word,\u201d he said, tapping at his tab. \u201cDrop the van at this sataddress. Enjoy the rest of your night.\u201d\nEris felt her own tab, wrapped around her wrist, rumble at the data transfer. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re not going to unload it?\u201d Kit demanded.\n\u201cNothing to unload,\u201d Schorr said. \u201cYou were driving one of the decoys. I\u2019ll put your mind at ease.\u201d He slid his hand against the deadman\u2019s lock. The doors sprang open. Eris saw a billow of steam and then nothing else, just bare white walls as the scanner had predicted.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Kit made a show of checking the payment on her tab. \u201cPleasure doing business, I guess.\u201d\nSchorr swung the doors shut, and Kit climbed back in the driver\u2019s side. Eris caught a last glimpse of what they were unloading: a big crate, bigger than she was, covered in a black shroud that seemed to eat the light.\nAs soon as they were around the corner, Kit triggered the autopilot and jumped right out of the van, rolling more gracefully than Eris would\u2019ve managed.\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d she demanded once they were on their feet.\nSneak in. See what he actually brought down here. Kit unrolled the smartglove and pulled it on, then slid the gun\u2014it was a biogun, calcium spikes instead of traceable bullets\u2014into Eris\u2019s waistband. It was pretty fucking uncomfortable.\nBut she had to admit she was curious, too. She\u2019d seen only a slice of the crate and now she wanted to know what was inside, the same way she\u2019d always wanted to know what was inside an upcar carapace or engine block.\nKit crept them back around the corner into the alley, which was now deserted. The other vans and drivers had gone on their way. Halfway down, she stopped in front of a rusty metal door in the alley wall. After a few moments of tuning the smartglove, Kit found the lock and popped it.\nShe swung the door open, and Eris could feel a damp coming from inside. She would have shivered. Even Kit seemed hesitant for a second, but maybe she was only scoping things out. As they stepped inside, retrofitted biolights bloomed to life, providing stark contrast to a grimy cracked corridor. Eris\u2019s eyes stung a bit as Kit did something with the smartglove again.\nNot picking up any surveillance cams. Good.\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Eris echoed. They walked forward. Foam insulation was oozing from the walls, and at the end of the corridor she saw an ancient-looking elevator with actual physical buttons to push. Only the down arrow was still intact.\nThey were going to go even deeper. Eris felt a whine rising in the back of her throat and tamped it down. Kit thumbed the call button.\nDispatch might have a hard time finding us down here. This is pre-Calamities architecture. The City\u2019s old bones. It has a way of screwing with our scanners.\n\u201cWhat about with the brainshare?\u201d Eris demanded. As much as she disliked having Kit run the show, she didn\u2019t want to find herself suddenly alone down here, either. She\u2019d never fired a biogun, or any kind of gun, and she had a feeling stunspray wouldn\u2019t cut it if Schorr and his thugs suddenly popped out of the dark.\nThat uses an entanglement drive. I wouldn\u2019t worry.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried,\u201d Eris said. \u201cHop in the elevator already, chicken shit.\u201d\nKit did, and as the doors slid shut behind them Eris felt like she was going to be sick with fear, and couldn\u2019t help but wonder if some of it was from Kit. The elevator sank and sank. The air felt like it was thickening, squeezing her temples. Maybe just her imagination.\nShe was relieved when the box came to a stop. Kit jammed her thumb on the close door button to keep it from opening. Eris listened, wondering if Schorr was standing on the other side, waiting for them. But when Kit fed a little hairline cam from her smartglove through the crack in the doors, it showed all clear.\nThey slipped out into a tunnel. Its ancient concrete was splinted by nanotube resin that glistened wetly, making it feel like the gullet of some animal. The air was definitely thicker down here. Damper. It clung to the back of Eris\u2019s throat. Kit moved them forward slowly and stealthily. The lights flickered, like the power was being rerouted, and it made Eris see things in the shadows that weren\u2019t there.\nA T-intersect approached, and as they reached it Eris heard footfalls. Kit scuttled back a step. Crouched. They clung there against the wall as one of Schorr\u2019s men trundled past. Eris wasn\u2019t sure if it was her or Kit holding her breath, but it didn\u2019t get released until he disappeared around the next bend.\nThey started moving again. Eris wanted to suggest that maybe Kit should have just shot him, to give them one less problem to deal with later, but Kit had her mouth sealed shut. They came to a halt outside a door that made Eris\u2019s heart hammer hard. They had passed plenty of doors, but this one was different. It had been widened to fit the crate.\nKit sent another hairline cam, jiggered another lock, and then they were inside. Lights flicked on unbidden, harsh white, surgical, and Eris saw the crate had been opened.\nA glass-and-metal sarcophagus was propped upright facing them. And inside it, she saw a mass of thick green-black ivy and decomposed flesh that she knew had been a human being once.\nEris\u2019s stomach revolted, but she couldn\u2019t avert her eyes, couldn\u2019t keep from tracing the poisonous green roots and tendrils that tangled through cracked bones, the bubbling brown spores clustered at the groin, under the arms. The face was burst open and flowering a bright poisonous red.\n\u201cShit,\u201d she whispered.\nShit, Kit agreed.\n\u201cI see you\u2019ve met the Green Man,\u201d Schorr\u2019s voice said from behind them.\nKit whirled; Schorr had something out of his pocket, a spindly metal thing that Eris didn\u2019t recognize. He flung it outward, pointing it right at her face, and instead of somersaulting away or snapping it out of his hand or doing any other kind of ninja thing, Eris found herself frozen again. The thrum was all through her body this time.\nFuck, fuck, fuck, it\u2019s a halo. I\u2019m going to lose you. Look, Eris, just stay calm and\u2014\nKit\u2019s voice cut out. Schorr stepped forward, twisting the thing together, making it into a circle. He set it gently on her head like he was crowning her. It tightened and clung there.\n\u201cThis should help you feel a little more like yourself,\u201d he said.\nEris realized her muscles were hers again, but when she tried to move her arms they didn\u2019t respond, hanging there heavy as lead. The halo was fucking them up, too. Her chest went tight with panic.\nKit was gone, and now it was only her, stuck somewhere underground with the leader of a doomsday cult and two of his thugs, one of whom had already found the biogun in her waistband, and Schorr knew about the OCI and the brainshare and she was dead dead dead. She felt oddly numb as they stripped her of the weapon and the smart glove and dragged her away from the sarcophagus. Her arms dangled uselessly.\n\u201cAll this for a fucking corpse?\u201d she asked. She knew she should be using whatever time she had left to make a case for her life, but somehow, even facing imminent death, the Green Man was still the scariest thing in the room.\nSchorr didn\u2019t answer for a moment, walking to the sarcophagus instead and placing his hand against the glass. \u201cYou\u2019re from the colonies, aren\u2019t you? At first I wasn\u2019t sure. There are so few of you in the City. Only a handful in nearly a billion inhabitants.\u201d He paused. \u201cDo you like it here?\u201d\nEris gave a shrug that she hoped looked contemptuous and unafraid. Whatever Schorr was playing at, he hadn\u2019t killed her yet.\n\u201cFrom a certain perspective, it\u2019s everything our ancestors dreamed of,\u201d Schorr said. \u201cTriple the size of any the old metropolises built before the Calamities. Towers to heaven, cars that fly, one language, no hunger, no . . . disease.\u201d\nHis face turned hard and angry.\n\u201cAnd all it cost us was seventy percent of the world\u2019s population in a century of mass death,\u201d he said. \u201cBut after all that, all the wars, the floods, the famines, we didn\u2019t learn a thing. Not one thing. Forward thinkers did their best in the aftermath. The Neoprim movements, for one, tried to show people a better way.\u201d He gave a smile that reminded Eris of the tweaker Kit had wasted. \u201cThe fact that you were born at all is thanks to that better way. You would have been an early termination here in the City. It\u2019s easier to be cruel when people become populations. When they become numbers.\u201d\nEris couldn\u2019t help thinking of the serial numbers on her arms, the license holo on her cab, the figure in her Bank account that seemed to be always eroding and never growing. The City did make her feel like a number. The City was cruel in a lot of ways.\n\u201cBut the colonies aren\u2019t enough,\u201d Schorr continued. \u201cThe mass exodus we envisioned never happened, and now the City is swelling like a tick. Repeating all our old mistakes. The only true solution is a full reset. Acknowledge that everything from agriculture onward was a blip on the radar. That\u2019s where the Green Man comes in.\u201d\nEris shot another look at the sarcophagus and wished she hadn\u2019t.\n\u201cThe colonies made themselves useful in another way,\u201d Schorr said. \u201cAs a breeding ground for disease. One of which was a fast-acting fungal infection, a particularly vicious strain we\u2019ve never seen before. It decimated two separate colonies before it was contained.\u201d\nEris\u2019s heart dropped. \u201cBullshit,\u201d she said. \u201cI would know.\u201d\nBut she wouldn\u2019t, she knew she wouldn\u2019t. She avoided anything to do with the colonies because it was easier to slice off that part of her life and cauterize it, and here in the City people didn\u2019t care what happened in the colonies. They didn\u2019t talk about them.\n\u201cThis was the only body I managed to save from incineration and have smuggled over,\u201d Schorr said. \u201cA lot of lives were lost. More to come. But none in vain.\u201d His eyes were shining. \u201cHumanity\u2019s going to return to its rightful place. Gaia to hers. We\u2019ll be at peace again, like we were for the first hundred thousand years.\u201d\nA cold question had assembled itself in the corner of Eris\u2019s mind. She asked it now, hoarsely. \u201cWhich colonies? Which colonies were wiped out?\u201d\n\u201cWhich colony are you from?\u201d Schorr asked.\nShe could barely force the syllables from her lips. \u201cNew Tenochtitlan.\u201d\nSchorr\u2019s face twisted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cNone in vain.\u201d\nBlack pushed in the sides of her vision. Eris felt herself sink to one knee. She was back in the colony, sitting in the compound dirt with her dad across from her, the magnetic chessboard between them. He was tall and stern with his white beard stark against lined brown skin. He was saying that it would be better for her in the City, and she was thinking that if she could just manage to win the game, he would let her stay.\nBut she\u2019d never won against her dad, not ever, and she never practiced with anyone else because she spent all her spare time in the field driving the village\u2019s battered utility upcar or taking apart motors in the garage. She didn\u2019t win that last game, either.\nEris kept her head down as one of his men led her out of the room, back into the tunnel. If she didn\u2019t look up at all, she wouldn\u2019t be able to look for traces of her dad in the overgrown green corpse.\nThey put her in a storage room, under guard, with a folding chair that sprang upright when she bumped into it. She\u2019d asked, dully, if they were planning to sacrifice her or some culty shit like that. Schorr had laughed before walking out.\nShe ignored the chair and collapsed down against the wall instead. It felt like she was having a nightmare. She felt hot thick guilt for how she never talked about the colony, how she pretended to herself she\u2019d been born in the City like everyone else. She\u2019d spent so long trying to forget her father who\u2019d sent her away. Trying to focus on her arms, on her cab, on things she could change and repair. Now she could see so many old familiar faces in her head, and they kept bursting apart like the Green Man in the sarcophagus.\nShe squeezed her eyes shut and tried to make it all just disappear. It didn\u2019t.\nShe would have to change it.\nEris opened her eyes. No matter how cruel the City was, it was full of innocent people, same as the colonies. Kit and the OCI needed to know about the Green Man, and that meant she needed to get rid of the halo somehow. She turned and dragged her head along the wall, feeling for the halo\u2019s metal edge. It wasn\u2019t loose enough to knock free, but not as tight as she\u2019d feared, either.\nEris kicked off her shoes and pawed off one sock and then the other. Her arms were dead useless weight at her sides, but they hadn\u2019t tied her legs. She scooted back, leaning her shoulders against the wall, and stretched.\nShe\u2019d lost a lot of flexibility since she\u2019d gotten her artis, but not all of it. Brushing her big toe against the halo, however, resulted in a sharp shock. She swore, yanking her foot back down.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she breathed. \u201cFuck it.\u201d\nShe stretched again, muscles straining taut, and wriggled her big toe underneath the edge of the halo. The shock bit hard; she saw a hot blue spark fly in her peripheral. Clenching her teeth, she gripped the halo between her big toe and long toe and pulled.\nIt clattered to the floor, spinning like a coin. She silenced it with her other foot. Hopefully the man standing outside hadn\u2019t heard it. Eris tipped her head back against the wall, breathing hard, as feeling returned to her arms. The pads of her toes were blistered red, but not blackened. She figured she would be able to walk properly.\nWhat\u2019s happening? Kit\u2019s voice came blurred, indistinct. Are you alright?\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fucking great, Kit,\u201d Eris said in a whisper. \u201cSchorr\u2019s got a sample of some kind of plague. Something he brought back from the colonies. He\u2019s going to release it here, and then everyone is fucked.\u201d\nThere was a pause that nearly made her panic, made her think Kit\u2019s signal was gone again. The Green Man cometh. Shit. That thing was supposed to have been eradicated. Kit\u2019s voice was agitated, but louder now, clearer. There\u2019s a strike team waiting in the alley. But we\u2019re not equipped to contain a bioweapon. I\u2019m coming in.\nEris\u2019s body thrummed and her head started twisting without her volition, making a sweep of the storage room.\nHave you seen anyone else down here?\n\u201cStill just Schorr and the two big fuckers,\u201d Eris muttered. \u201cHe told one of them to watch the door.\u201d\nShe shut her mouth as Kit pushed her face up against the door, listening. Eris heard the sound of shifting weight, fabric rubbing fabric. Kit nearly lost their balance as the door swung open.\nFor an instant Schorr\u2019s man was framed in the doorway, and Eris looked up him like a mountain, the hormone-popped muscle and buzzed head and green tattoos creeping out from his cufflinks. His face was unworried, Eris figured because the last time he\u2019d seen her she\u2019d been crying like a little baby and because she didn\u2019t have working arms, besides.\n\u201cSchorr wants you at the ceremony,\u201d he said, and then he realized the halo was no longer on Eris\u2019s head and his eyes went wide.\nKit dismantled him. Cartilage cracked, air thumped out of a collapsed lung, dead weight slammed the floor. He was still struggling for breath in the fetal position as Kit retrieved the biogun and used Eris\u2019s arms to lever him into the room. She shut the door neatly behind her and the lock buzzed active. It was a good thing Kit was still using her mouth, because Eris knew she would\u2019ve let out a triumphant whoop right about then.\nThat\u2019s music, isn\u2019t it?\nEris concentrated. It was. Chanting and drumbeat, faint but audible. The kind of faux-primal shit she remembered hearing as a kid in the Neoprim colony.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Eris said, finding her mouth was hers again. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThey followed the sound of the synthesized drums and wailing, quickly and quietly. Normally Eris\u2019s feet slapped a bit when she walked, but not with Kit moving them\u2014she was poised now, all coiled and balanced like a cat. It made her more hopeful Kit could handle whatever they found at the end of the labyrinth.\nRounding a pitted corner, the music grew louder and Eris started to see small bundles lining the walls, shoes on top.\n\u201cClothes?\u201d she demanded in a whisper. \u201cWhy the fuck are people taking their clothes off?\u201d\nDon\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s for some kind of fertility ritual.\n\u201cAs in, a big fucking orgy.\u201d\nYeah. Some of them do that.\nThe music reached a fever pitch, then cut out entirely. Eris\u2019s ears felt swamped by the sudden silence. Kit hesitated, then moved ahead even more slowly, creeping towards a pale yellow light leaking from the next corner. She hunkered low and poked Eris\u2019s head around to look.\nTheir tight corridor was one of several emptying into a much larger room, and the room was full of people. They were all naked, and as much as Eris wanted it to look funny or stupid, it didn\u2019t. It looked eerie, all of them standing there in rows in the ghostly yellow light. Some of them had smartpainted their bodies in twisting green vines that slithered up and down their bare skin. Other than that, they were stock-still, all of their eyes fixed on the makeshift plinth in the center of the room.\nThe figure standing on top of it wore ragged robes over a long coat. Their face was hidden under some kind of military issue gas mask, vaguely insectoid, daubed green and brown and set with skeletal antlers. Eris felt a shudder that might have been hers, might have been Kit\u2019s. That had to be Schorr. And looming behind him, propped upright in a sort of groove, was the sarcophagus.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been called here to receive the Green Man\u2019s blessing.\u201d\nSchorr\u2019s voice, dead and amplified, split the air.\n\u201cTonight is the beginning of the end, my friends.\u201d\nThe naked men and women started to chant something back, raising their hands, then Eris\u2019s view was blocked as Kit pulled her shirt over her head.\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d Eris hissed, muffled by the fabric.\nHe\u2019s inoculating them, right? These are his followers. Kit peeled her trousers off next, see-sawing them off her hips. We can join in. Get close enough.\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d\nKill Schorr.\n\u201cWhat, with my bare fucking hands?\u201d Eris demanded. Kit kicked off her shoes and shucked off her bra and underwear.\nWith no hands. I\u2019m going to have to take your arms off, Eris.\nEris blinked. All the naked bodies, some of them scarred, none of them with visible implants or prostheses. She remembered back to what Ndirangu had said all those eons ago. Neo-Luddite. Rejection of technology. She wondered if they knew Schorr had Optiks.\nOkay? Kit\u2019s voice sounded almost ashamed.\nEris tongued the gap in her molars. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me do it.\u201d\nNow she was almost sure it was a nightmare. With Kit directing her steps, Eris felt like she was gliding through the crowd, magnetically drawn to the plinth where Schorr and the Green Man waited. Her bare skin was swathed in goose bumps and the nubbed ends of her arms felt every cold current in the air. When she brushed the left by accident against someone else\u2019s clammy skin, her nerve terminations screamed.\nThe biogun was tucked into her right armpit, blunt muzzle all but concealed. Schorr was still speaking, but Eris couldn\u2019t hear it. Too absorbed in the rest of it, in the naked bodies pale and dark sliding against hers, in the quickcrete\u2014no, concrete, this stuff was ancient\u2014that spiked cold against the bottom of her feet. The sweat trickling from under her armpits. The blank and fevered faces all around her.\nShe was sure at any second they would spot the biogun and realize she wasn\u2019t one of them and tear her to shreds. She wanted to turn and run, scoop her arms back from where she\u2019d stashed them in the corridor, make like hell for the elevator. But she couldn\u2019t. Not with Kit propelling her forward, and not with Schorr planning to turn the whole City, the City she sometimes hated so much, into overgrown corpses like had been done to her colony.\nEveryone was pressing closer, now, crushing in against the plinth, and Eris looked for an injector or an autosurgeon, something he would use to distribute the Vaxine update that would keep them safe from his plague. But there was nothing up there with him except the casket and a dull metal beaker.\nEris realized what the Green Man\u2019s blessing was the split second before Schorr thumbed the catch. The casket split open with a pneumatic hiss, an innocuous puff of dust. The crowd was clamoring for the Green Man. Pressing in close, climbing up the plinth, trying to touch him. Schorr reached into the casket and plucked one finger from the Green Man\u2019s desiccated hand like picking an overripe fruit. He crumbled it into the beaker. Eris could hear the powder hiss as it hit water, or maybe only imagined it.\nShe tried to wrest control back from Kit. She needed to scream. She needed to tell them not to fucking drink it, not to even fucking touch it. But Kit was still moving, grim and steady, toward the plinth. Eris watched the beaker pass from hand to hand, dark fluid leaking from pale lips. She knew they were already dead. Schorr wasn\u2019t inoculating his followers; he was using them as his final test subjects.\nSomeone who wasn\u2019t Eris started to scream. The first devotees to drink from the beaker were writhing now, toppling backward off the plinth into the crowd. She saw the infection moving through their bodies like a time-lapse, their fingers and faces swelling, bubbling, poisonous green and mud brown. She could almost feel it.\nKit accelerated, weaving through bodies. Three figures in hazard suits had detached themselves from the shadows and now were closing the casket again, dragging it backward onto a hoverjack. Schorr was still standing, still watching the chaos. People ran, panicked\u2014if they\u2019d come expecting to die, they hadn\u2019t expected it to be this painful.\nKit had them close, now, close enough to reach out and grab the rough corner of the plinth. Schorr noticed, finally turning his masked head. Eris saw her ghostly reflection in the insectoid eyes. Kit twisted so the biogun was aimed right at him, all she had to do was squeeze and at this range she\u2019d said it would shred right through him and\u2014\nOne of the fleeing devotees blindsided her, smacking an arm across her chin. Eris would\u2019ve known how to twist, how to compensate, but Kit was unbalanced by it and she staggered. Suddenly they were on the floor, rolling to avoid feet, the biogun gone. Someone tripped on her, stomped by accident on her gut; the wind went out of her hard. By the time Kit had her upright, Schorr was gone, too. She vaulted them up on the plinth, spinning, searching.\nThere.\nThe sarcophagus was gliding away through the crowd, back the way they\u2019d come, ushered by Schorr and his men. Back into the crush. Kit kept her eyes fixed on the target, but Eris saw flashes of the infected men and women, all wailing and writhing. Was this how it had been in the colony? Was this how her father had died?\nShe saw the tail end of the sarcophagus disappearing around the next corner. She was running faster than she\u2019d ever, Kit wringing every last bit of energy from her muscles. They made it to the elevator just as the doors slid shut on Schorr\u2019s turned back.\nShit!\n\u201cAren\u2019t your people waiting for him at the top?\u201d Eris gasped.\nHe\u2019s already streamed the footage of what just happened back there. Says if there\u2019s any attempt to follow him, he feeds the Green Man through a nebulizer and the spores go airborne. Says he\u2019s open to negotiations.\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Eris snapped. \u201cHe\u2019s lying. He wants to do the whole fucking City.\u201d\nI\u2019m being ordered to stand down, Eris. I fucked this up. Bad.\n\u201cThen if Ndirangu asks, it was all me,\u201d Eris said.\nThere was a pause. There\u2019s a civilian upcar that\u2019ll be unlocked and unalarmed just around the block. And from here on in, the brainshare implant is malfunctioning.\nThe thrumming returned, and an instant later Eris\u2019s body was hers again. The lactic acid in her muscles and aches in her joints made her want to collapse to the floor and rest for a second, just a second. Instead, she staggered back down the hallway. Found her clothes. Her arms. She chinned them back into place. Artinerves snaked up to meet the tender flesh and she flexed her metal fingers.\n\u201cFucking right I drive this time,\u201d she muttered.\nSchorr was in one of the white vans, climbing fast, by the time Eris threw herself inside the little blue upcar Kit had picked for her. It wasn\u2019t the absolute last vehicle Eris would\u2019ve snagged for a pursuit, but it was close. She slammed over to manual and hauled it up off the pavement, making a dozen hurried adjustments to the dampers, the updrive, the seat. There was no way she was going to catch the van with the inbuilt speed limits still operational, but if she stopped to do the rewiring, Schorr was good as gone.\nEris jammed the seat back and drove with her feet, how she\u2019d done on the battered old ute in the colony, while she gutted the panel with her metal hands. She\u2019d lost some dexterity over the years. Lost the calluses, too.\nBut she could still do it. One foot on the pedals and one steering, she split her concentration between navigating the lower streets, mercifully empty of traffic, and finding the right port on her arm. The van was still in sight, bulling through a cloud of camera drones she assumed were OCI, but in another second it would be a speck and then gone entirely.\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have found me a fucking custom?\u201d she breathed, even though she wasn\u2019t sure Kit could hear her anymore. She hunted through a tangle of wires, taking both eyes off the windshield, and was nearly blindsided by a cab. The proximity alert wailed, and she could see the driver mouthing off, too, but it didn\u2019t matter because she\u2019d found the right wire and the right port.\nShe fed it in, and suddenly she could feel the upcar like an extension of her arms, which were an extension of her brain, and in her brain she decided to go however fucking fast she wanted. She deleted the limits, gunned the engine, and acceleration pinned her to her seat like an invisible hand.\nSchorr had a big gap on her, but he was driving carefully. Eris wasn\u2019t. She was driving wild. Her metal hands were barely skimming the steering wheel, plucking it left, down, right, left, up, fast enough to blur. The City was streaming all around her, unfocused, but she knew its architecture like she knew her own body and all she had to do was follow the van and not even brush another upcar or drone. Her tongue was planted firm between her molars.\nShe was shredding the speed limits to pieces, but Kit had to be blocking the safety signal that would have normally overridden her by now. And if there were sweepers patrolling, she\u2019d like to see them try to catch her. Eris knew she shouldn\u2019t be smiling. Kit wouldn\u2019t have been smiling. But her lips were dragged back off her teeth all the same.\nShe felt good. Really good. And if there were Green Man spores already inside her, if she was moments from bursting into a viny writhing mess, the instant crash would probably kill her before the infection did. She came level with the white van, then hurtled past it, and she realized where Schorr was heading.\nShe cut speed, matching Schorr, who tried to shake left. Eris clung to him like a shadow. Up ahead, one of the City\u2019s largest filtration plants approached, a somber giant in gunmetal grays and blues. Pipettes stretched from its towering tanks into the surrounding infrastructure, pumping water through the City like a beating heart, and that was where Schorr wanted to release the Green Man.\nWhich meant he\u2019d been bluffing about taking it airborne. Eris thought back to the underground communion, the beaker being passed. The spores needed water.\nSchorr banked hard and down, and Eris realized something else: he didn\u2019t need to get all the way to the plant entrance. He only needed to get to one of the water tanks, and those were a hell of a lot closer. The white van put on a final burst of speed, angling towards the nearest of them, and Eris could see the top of the tank sliding open via whatever override code Ferris Carrow, owner of half the filtration plants in the City, the woman with the flower in her stomach, had been murdered for.\nEris could already imagine the van puttering to a neat halt, Schorr\u2019s men shoving the open casket out the back so it dropped down into the tank like a pill into a water glass. The Green Man would fizz and dissolve and the City would drink his dead body. Use it in their showers, their hydroponics. If there were safety valves to isolate the tank she figured Schorr had codes for those, too.\nThey were bare meters away from the tank. She reached for the extra impact webbing and tugged it over herself. Clenched her teeth, then unclenched them, trying to guess what would make them least likely to shatter in her jaw. Breathed deep.\nAll it took was a twitch to send her smashing into the top of the van. The sound of shearing metal filled her ears and the impact shook her bones. She could feel herself screaming in her chest as they spun. Feedback from her arms rolled over her like a static wave. She yanked them free and covered her head as the upcar and the van, tangled now, hit the lip of the water tower.\nThe impact webbing wove itself around her like an ammonia-smelling cocoon, wrapping her in darkness, but she still felt the upcar crumple. Her head still snapped forward, back. Her teeth scraped her tongue raw on their way shut. Metal was moving all around her, squealing and crunching, and then suddenly there was stillness.\nEris wanted to flop backward and breathe for a minute, stay in the warm hug of the impact webbing, but she tore her way free instead. The upcar had flipped around, so she had to punch her way out of the back. The whole chassis was shifting, rocking, and when she finally dragged herself out she realized her plan had half-worked.\nThey\u2019d splintered against the lip of the water tower; her upcar was still riding the top of the van, which was now sheared in two. The front end of it was a mangle of debris falling down, down, down into the City depths. The back end had skidded over the edge more or less intact, and its doors were torn open. Steam was gushing out.\nEris climbed down from the wreckage on wobbly legs. She managed to nick herself a few times, but she could hardly feel the sting, too buzzed with adrenaline still. The top of the water tank hadn\u2019t opened all the way, leaving a few meters of slippery metal floor. She approached the edge with a feeling of dread, wondering if she was going to see the casket bobbing inside, if she\u2019d accidentally dumped the Green Man exactly where Schorr wanted him.\nBut when she craned over the edge, she saw only gurgling water. Relief hit her all at once. She sank to a crouch, feeling the adrenaline start to ebb. She\u2019d done it. Holy fuck.\n\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d she choked. \u201cDid you see that shit, Kit?\u201d\nAnother creaky groan came from behind her. She turned, expecting to see the remains of the upcar sliding off the van, not expecting to see Schorr emerging from the back like some kind of bogeyman, framed by billowing steam. His long coat was torn and one of the antlers had snapped clean off his gas mask, but apart from that he didn\u2019t look the least bit shook by the crash.\n\u201cYou fucking bitch.\u201d The words came out dead and flat through the mask, but Eris had the distinct feeling they would have sounded the same without it. Schorr had another halo out, pointing it at her.\nEris didn\u2019t feel a thing. Kit really had severed the brainshare.\n\u201cThat was all me,\u201d Eris said, forcing a bravado she didn\u2019t feel, not even a little. \u201cOCI\u2019s going to be all over your ass in about two fucking seconds, though.\u201d She could hear the wail of emergency drones approaching and hoped a silver upcar or two were with them.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll be quick,\u201d Schorr said, and he turned back to the van. Going back for the casket. Eris stood frozen for a second, then anger poured through and thawed her. He was ignoring her. Just fucking ignoring her, like with no brainshare she was no threat at all. Eris sprung the stunspray from her arm and lunged.\nSchorr swatted her out of the air without even turning around. He had to have back-cams in that mask of his, and maybe he had some kind of skeletal implants, too, because he was stronger than any asshole philanthropist-slash-cultist had a right to be. Eris hit the ground hard with the breath smashed out of her lungs. She saw Schorr\u2019s boot stomp down on her wrist, crushing circuitry, and her fingers spasmed. The stunspray flew out of her grip. She heard it bounce once, twice, then a distant splash as it went into the tank. Shit.\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Schorr asked. \u201cIs being a hero now for the blink of an eye worth being a villain for the rest of eternity?\u201d He seized the edge of the casket with both hands and started to pull. The metal screeched, throwing sparks. \u201cIt\u2019s that lack of foresight that got us here in the first place,\u201d he grunted.\nEris rolled over. Coughed. \u201cNew Tenochtitlan,\u201d she rasped. \u201cWere you telling the truth?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nEris threw herself at his back again, making her fists into clubs, battering his head and shoulders. This time Schorr spun and reached. The arm he\u2019d stomped on was slow, jittery, and he managed to grip it now with both hands. He planted one foot on Eris\u2019s shoulder and tore it free. Feedback lanced all the way down Eris\u2019s spine like a plume of lava. She howled.\nAnother kick took the wind out of her, and she sprawled back on the slick metal. Schorr dragged the casket towards the edge. Towards the swirling water.\n\u201cKit, where the fuck are you?\u201d Eris hollered. She crawled after him on hand and knees, still convulsing. He had the casket poised on the lip. The Green Man, shaken apart by the crash, was barely human-looking at all now, just a viscous, poisonous green mass.\nSchorr was leaning down to thumb the catch when his gloved hand blew apart. Eris blinked as a splinter of bloody bone flew past her face. She stared at Schorr, who stared back at her through the lenses of his mask, both of them equally surprised. Then the second shot cracked the air, and his lenses splattered bright red. He crumpled.\nAs his lifeless body fell, it knocked into the casket and sent it lurching forward. Eris flung out her remaining arm and clamped to it. Feedback seared and she couldn\u2019t reach to switch it off. She gritted her teeth instead as she dug her heels in and pulled. The casket shifted by millimeter increments. Polymer muscles popped and strained in her arm. She pulled. Pulled.\nFinally the casket rocked backward, and Eris collapsed on top of it like she could pin it there permanently. She was still lying like that, gasping for breath, when the silver upcar touched down and Kit dropped out wearing a harness with her sniper rifle stowed in back of it.\n\u201cHoly shit, Eris.\u201d\nKit squatted down beside her, checking her over with a mediscanner, then moved her off the casket. In Eris\u2019s peripherals she could see people in hazard suits with scanners of their own. Two of them were bagging Schorr\u2019s body.\nA blurred out face appeared over her. \u201cWell done, Eris,\u201d Ndirangu\u2019s voice said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you a replacement for the damaged arm. And I\u2019ve just put the request through regarding the traffic cams.\u201d\nEris tipped her head back against the cold metal roof of the water tower. \u201cFuck that,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about you just give me a job?\u201d\nKit gave her gravelly laugh. Eris didn\u2019t mind. She didn\u2019t like wearing black anyways, and had something more important to do, besides. Have the OCI pay her way back across the ocean on the first available vessel. She needed to see New Tenochtitlan, or what was left of it. She needed to see stars again.\nShe needed to know if her dad was really gone. Eris took a deep breath of the cold night air, and for a moment she could taste the prickling warm breeze that swept through the colony compound at night. Whatever she found over there, she would deal with it. Hopefully the replacement arm would be ready by the time she left, but if it wasn\u2019t, she would deal with that, too.\nShe was exactly as tough as she thought she was.\nRich Larson (Ymir, Tomorrow Factory) was born in Galmi, Niger, has lived in Spain and Czech Republic, and is currently based in Grande Prairie, Canada.

Just a tiny pinky nail-sized small bit of organic matter, roasted then crushed, soaked, and drained. Don\u2019t throw away the baby with the bathwater, but in this case, really, do. Chuck it out, totally discard the baby, but keep the bathwater and drink it all up. Pour it into your mug, watch the steam rise up, and sip. It shouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\nPeople like to think they\u2019re in control of their lives, but deprive them of a bit of this bean soup and they\u2019re useless. Millions of people, around the world, brain-dead without the dark juice.\nBrain-dead\u2019s how Ava Chen feels as she throws her apron down. A few customers are asking for the check, but she sends one of the busboys. She\u2019s had it, working at a diner\u2019s worse than her past ten barista jobs, and she\u2019s done with complaints of the fish (you don\u2019t order seafood at a diner, hon), the seniors who tip pennies (she would feel sorry for their empty pension plans if it weren\u2019t for her own vacant pockets), and babies and their spills (sure they\u2019re cute, but they\u2019re less so when sweeping up their dozens of Cheerios they\u2019ve sent flying like the god of rain). The drizzle patters at the window for the fifth day in the row, always ready for her right when her shift ends. As she watches, the drizzle turns fierce and she shifts in her precision sneakers. Not walking, she decides. Can\u2019t stand squishy socks. She calls up a self-cabbie with a flip gesture.\nHeading home in five, just after she counts her tips. Her headache pangs. She pours herself a mug of joe from the pot, takes a gulp, and spits it out. Burned, stale. Awful. She\u2019d rather chew on the grinds.\nThey\u2019ve got precision patty-flippers, everfrozen cubes for soda, and temperature rigor emulsifying creams for the sauces, but they can\u2019t get even a damn cup of coffee right? Diners used to be about getting a nice warm mug, but now it\u2019s more about getting gossip, being seen, making an appearance so people can tell you have a physical existence outside of the holowaves. For once, she\u2019d like that perfect cup of joe, kind of like the one her fianc\u00e9 used to make for her every morning before he decided to head out, coffee machine and all. Good riddance. It was a shame, but not entirely. The sex was mediocre and the coffee was good, close to awesome, but not divine.\nRight now, she wants divine. She wants that perfect buzz to settle on her, that pure mix of sweet and bitterness that passes through the lips, reaches the tongue, and slides down the gullet. Hot and aromatic.\nAs she counts the measly digits of digicash that her customers leave behind, she catches the sound of holowaves. Manager Martin\u2019s watching his reality show again, Grub Howls, Food Champs on the Prowl. His eyes glued to the bubblescreen. He\u2019s supposed to be scheduling or doing something, but she hears the waves with Chef Carl, the current gastrochamp railing at the employees, in his gruff accent. No, not like that\u2014did you grow up on a pig farm? Used to splashing around liquids everywhere? Pea soup\u2019s a delicate thing, not slop for the trough!\nMartin wishes he were like that, running the modern equivalent of a gulag, but he doesn\u2019t have that tyrannical bent. He\u2019s just a bit obnoxious. And lazy. And may as well throw in incompetent while she\u2019s at it.\nChef Carl was lucky that the event he competed in was for Philadelphia pilaf and it was new enough to not have many competitors. Last season was all P\u2019s: pizza, Peking duck, pecan pies, perogies, pig\u2019s feet. This season was C\u2019s: cottage cheese, coffee, carrot cake, chana masala, coconut water, chocolate\u2014and Ava\u2019s heart skips a beat when she considers the coffee competition approaching.\nNow, I, I could do it, thinks Ava. Be that tyrant. Get back at all those terrible bosses and persnickety coworkers at all those hoity toity caf\u00e9s. She knows it\u2019s not the first time she thinks that, nor will it be the last. All the caf\u00e9s in the past six years of her life, moving and moving, where she quit before they could fire her. She\u2019s not going to admit her coworkers are wrong, because they never are. She\u2019s just more right. She\u2019s got taste buds and the discerning tongue to back her up.\nShe hears the booming voice, You idiot, you don\u2019t know how to use the sonar wash for the china? Celebrity Chef Carl and his barrage of vitriol. The screaming champ who tells the restaurants how to get better. It\u2019s not just a pipe dream to become that guy. It\u2019s her calling. Every time she tries to improve something in any establishment, they blackball her. How great it would be to get the title, march into all those flailing businesses she worked in, and give the management a bit of what they deserved. She smirks and her wrist blinks.\nTime for her home gastronomic trials.\nEvery so often Ava gets something in her head that fixates her. An image she\u2019s crafted that\u2019s more than just vision; something that makes her limbic system roar with its gut-hitting beauty. The perfect salted nut. How many granules? How dried? The ideal bowl of steamed rice. How chewy? Steaming for how long?\nFor six years, she\u2019s been jumping ship, coffee shop to coffee shop, trying to figure out that perfect bit of that murky bathwater. She likes the pursuit. She likes the irony.\nOne of the mysteries of coffee. The grinds get tossed, the derivative salvaged.\nShe\u2019s been hunting this best derivative, scouring all of the states. Her mind tells her she should stay in one place, rake up enough cash, but her quick mouth and exacting sense of taste are impatient, yearning to move on.\nWhen the car finally stops, she flips the tab to send the tip to the self-drive corporations (why she has to use her hard-earned tips to impart to faceless corps she doesn\u2019t know, but this bot slid without bumps so who is she to complain). She lands on her sofa and doesn\u2019t spend more than ten minutes there before a beep interrupts the quiet.\nShe groans, reaches for her arm in slow-mo, and pulls up the 3-D image of her sorority sis, in her bob and lab-friendly white blouse, smiling back at her. It remains frozen, her teeth shining, and Ava takes a moment to lower the lights, as to not blind Denise Kam with the glare through the projection.\nDenise used to be so young and na\u00efve back in college, but now she\u2019s matured into a physics lab assistant\u2014way too smart for the job. Ava\u2019s almost regretful that she coerced Denise to apply for the assistant position. Ava probably should have pressed her to apply for a better job, but well, at least this is better than nothing. Without Ava, Denise just sits around, figuring out stuff. She\u2019s an excellent hacker, too, and if she had a more conniving bone in her body and stickier hands, could probably retrieve results from other labs. Not that Ava would promote that.\nIf Ava were still her acting big sis mentor, like back in the good ol\u2019 days, she would push Denise\u2019s too complacent self to apply for other positions and move upward, but she knows Denise would just say that she\u2019s content with the way she is and she\u2019s not like Ava, always moving on to the next thing. Ava can see in Denise\u2019s eyes a kind of hunger. This look\u2019s even present now through the holowave projection as Ava mouths an \u201caccept.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you got there?\u201d Ava says, even before Denise gets to sneak in a hi. Greetings unneeded for her closest\u2014who is she kidding?\u2014only friend.\n\u201cOh, no, nothing,\u201d Denise says, her arms still hidden, and rattles on about the physics conference right outside XCERN that she just came back from. About the experts in superconductivity of muons and charge transport she\u2019s rubbed elbows with. When it comes to physics, she\u2019s abound with energy and seems half Ava\u2019s age rather than just a few years younger than her. Must be one of those scientific anomalies, Ava figures.\nAva scours her sofa, finds a half-eaten bag of chips tucked in the folds, and starts popping chip after chip in her mouth. Their sog-resistant savory coat lets out a satisfying crunch and Denise doesn\u2019t seem to notice or care that her account of the weekend is punctuated by Ava\u2019s symphony of salty attainment.\nOnce the bag\u2019s done, Ava tosses the bag on the ground and the vac sweeps by, scans it, orders another, runs over it, backs up, does it again three more times and finally locates a pull point, plucks it up into its bod before it retreats. Ava\u2019s been meaning to get that thing upgraded.\nDenise starts talking about swag, whisper ID lanyards, and choptalk ear clips when she pulls out the dish. It\u2019s a small petri dish with some powder on it. \u201cI was wondering if you could smell it.\u201d\n\u201cI knew something was up,\u201d Ava says, sitting up. Something perks up in her olfactory receptors. Earthy, but bitter.\n\u201cIs that . . . ?\u201d Ava begins to say.\n\u201cLet me bring the specimen closer,\u201d says Denise, pulling a bendable polymer in the shape of a horn closer to the piece. Through the screen, Denise wafts with one hand. The aroma from the dark dust travels straight into Ava\u2019s nostrils.\nInstinctively, Ava moves her nose closer to the emitters.\n\u201cAh, that is the best smelling coffee I\u2019ve smelled in years!\u201d she cries.\nCoffee. Real, non-stale, non-rip \u2019em out of the package coffee.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d says Denise. She gives out one of her easy grins, before wafting some her own way, inhaling deep. \u201cI thought you\u2019d appreciate it more than me. But, if you think this smells good, you should try a cup.\u201d\n\u201cHow? What? Why?\u201d\n\u201cSwag,\u201d she says and Ava\u2019s all ears.\nSome people like to build things. Others like to smash things. Victor Lang is the kind of guy that likes to build things to smash things. Watermelon catapults. Greenray disc pelting guns. Release hammers. Last time on his contemporary art show, \u201cSmash \u2019em Squat,\u201d he took five defunct self-drivers, stacked them high, and brought them into a gigantic trash crunch maw that took five weeks to build. In twenty minutes the cars were gobbled up. Two weeks ago, he flaunted demolishing skills by creating the world\u2019s tiniest optic hammer and split open a dot-sized holowave battery. The whole thing was filmed using a magnilens. People like commissioning him for his flair and performative skills. Need a splash? Victor\u2019s got an ostrich egg ready for your launch.\n\u201cSatellite companies,\u201d says Denise. \u201cEver since they got their sticky hands on the cesium standard, entangled photons, and hyperplexity, they\u2019ve been itching to get their hands on more. \u2018Embracement of the sciences,\u2019 they call it. Always trying to see what breakthroughs they can implement.\u201d\n\u201cCurry favor with you basement tinkerers, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, get us physics lab hands and others on the bottom rungs to divulge our latest results before they\u2019re published or something. Not sure that ever works.\u201d\n\u201cBut, I\u2019m sure they have enough money to try,\u201d Ava says. \u201cNot like my broke self.\u201d\nDenise laughs. \u201cThey got tons of money.\u201d\nAva\u2019s not surprised about this. Denise has been talking about these companies calling up her lab, offering them discounts on communication packages, and passing out freebies at least a couple times a month.\nStill reeling from that powerful whiff of coffee, Ava opens up her collection of coffee beans she\u2019s bought from auctions and collectors, safe in her climate-controlled pillbox. She picks one up and sniffs. Fruity smells linger in her nostrils. \u201cSo, what? They send in a miniature of one of his gadgets? Promotional junk? Swag to ingratiate you beggin\u2019 lab assistants?\u201d\n\u201cBetter, they sent him. The satellite companies gave him a gig. And you know what he made?\u201d\n\u201cA bunch of money?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, for sure. Digidollars up the wazoo, well in stock money, which you know they won\u2019t see for years. But, he made a mini-collider.\u201d\n\u201cCute,\u201d says Ava. She picks up another bean. This one has a darker roasty smell.\n\u201cCute and compact. Crushed a bunch of stuff for us. That thing was cataclysmic.\u201d\n\u201cSays the person who works with banging particles together.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, so you know it must\u2019ve been impressive if I\u2019m telling you this.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\u201cBetter, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d\nDenise sends her a holoclip, which lights up in her apartment. It\u2019s way too bright in the conference hall and all those white jackets, designed to be halfway between lab coat and suit, blind her. She\u2019s about to complain when she sees a skinny dude, black hair slicked back, behind a table decked out in moving 3-D projections of his art, things going boom and smashing. In his hands is the collider. The collider\u2019s just a small ring, maybe the size of a Cooktune pot lid. Ava leans in as the artist starts explaining. His voice is nasal, reedy.\n\u201cA charge whips around and moves this plate, which gives whatever that\u2019s in-between a crunch. It\u2019s not any charge\u2014we\u2019ve got a specialized chip in here, with its network system transferred over from a genetically enhanced breed of eel.\u201d\nDenise\u2019s voice cuts through the holoclip: \u201cA little collider, kitschy and adorable. But, it\u2019s extremely powerful, more than he knows. He smashed up marshmallows, flat as discs\u2014always nice to give out some sugar to these bleary-eyed academics. The best kind of swag. And then he adjusted the settings. Someone gave him the spare button from their shirt. Pulverized the thing. I don\u2019t think anyone realizes how powerful that thing is. If you scale it up . . . \u201d\nIn that instance, the button smashes to bits.\nDenise continues, \u201cWell, that\u2019s another matter altogether. I\u2019ve been working on the computation for that and it\u2019ll be big. But, it got me thinking of you, of your\u2014\u201d\n\u201c\u2014hobby,\u201d Ava says.\n\u201c\u2014obsession,\u201d says Denise.\nAva sticks her tongue out at her, which Denise ignores or doesn\u2019t see.\nThe holoclip fizzes away and shows Denise again at her office, flipping through some of the floating orbs that contain her files. With info too precious to upload onto the waves, which would be a lot less clutter.\nDenise, through the holowaves, rearranges the data orbs, stroking one of them. \u201cI struck up a conversation with him.\u201d\n\u201cBet the satellite reps were glad about that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, they didn\u2019t get any info from me. But, I told him to wait and pulled out a few coffee beans from that stash you gave me. The ones you said I could crunch on during a down day. We tried smashing them. They pulverized okay. A little too charred. So I figure I\u2019ll pull out one of those not-yet roasted specimens that\u2019s just a keepsake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd . . . ?\u201d Ava is nearly salivating.\n\u201cYou\u2019re smelling it.\u201d\nDenise puts the sniff horn back next to the ground coffee dust, blown to bits in a tiny collider. Ava takes in another inhale and it blooms all around her, the full notes, the fruity tang. \u201cThis has got to be Argentina,\u201d says Ava.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Denise says.\n\u201cDark roast, bold bouquets.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, the heat toasted it right up.\u201d\nAva leans in, excited and knocks over a few beans, like the baby with the Cheerios. They scatter. \u201cYou know what this means, right?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re coming over to get a brew?\u201d\n\u201cNot just coming over. I\u2019m coming and scheming. I gotta get my hands on that collider.\u201d\nThere are two echelons in the world. The ones where you can demand for things and feel like you got a high probability of getting them, and then there\u2019s the ones where begging just makes you seem more pathetic. It\u2019s not like Ava can just go marching up to a contemporary artist hired by one of the big corps and just demand they hand it over. It\u2019s not even theirs at this point, the rights are bought by the corps.\nSlick, that\u2019s what she needs to be. She\u2019s gotta be subtle about it.\nThe mini-collider\u2019s kept not in Victor\u2019s workshop lab, but in an offshoot of the satellite corp. In their cultural outreach center. Sounds pretty tame, but it\u2019s flanked by security. They have some pretty valuable pieces of art in there. Valuable as in hefty price tags. Satellite corps commission atmospheric-entry-proof decals that are worth tons of money to be slapped on their satellite bodies for commercial purposes. Some say they engage in a not-too-shabby trade of space travel antiques, alongside the snazzy pop art pieces, too. To be socially relevant and keep their brands in peoples\u2019 minds, but it\u2019s pretty lucrative.\nThey\u2019ve got whole tons of stuff in storage, too, so talking heads say, but luckily Denise found out the mini-collider will be on display. It\u2019ll be trapped behind glass, waiting for sticky fingers, one of the thirty pieces at their current on-site rotating exhibition.\nGood Denise. Smart enough to ask enough pointed questions about the art piece. Just enough to sound engaged and curious.\nDenise plucks a data orb from her desk and passes it into her computer\u2019s frame. She must be doing work as she\u2019s talking. \u201cIs it really worth it?\u201d\n\u201cTo make the best coffee ever alive? Is there anything more perfect?\u201d\n\u201cString theory and the vibration of threads in harmony?\u201d\n\u201cFine, that and the coffee.\u201d\n\u201cWorth break-in and entry?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really breaking in if you\u2019re invited right? And besides, I\u2019ll be the one doing the dirty work.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, well, I guess it\u2019s better for me to be arrested as an apprentice than a perpetrator.\u201d\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s the spirit! Glad you\u2019ll be my backup.\u201d\n\u201cAnything for my sorority sis, right?\u201d\nThey do a cheesy hand slap through the holowaves and laugh.\nAva doesn\u2019t like to talk about her past bosses. The ones that verbally abused her, called her know-it-all punk, and used so many strings of curses, you\u2019d think they run out of air. Tony at Everfresh, Jazz at Calmorn, the infamous Jenny at Pour-Me-One. And the rest of them. Sure, she provokes them, but can she really help herself? Some of those faux beans they pass off as real have no taste complexity at all. Just generated blandness with pumped in acidity. And don\u2019t even talk about the rancid so-called fresh grounds. Those are just vile.\nBosses don\u2019t like to hear that. They like to hear that you\u2019ve earned more sales. They want to hear how many inches your smile increases when you approach the customer and that you\u2019ve input the spelling of their name right on the engraving zap for their cup. They would get robots if they could, but to get the kind that perform like, well, actual service folk and not like dummy vac here, would be more than most of these wanna-be-bohemian-but-actually-franchise joints are interested in investing.\nWhen Ava takes out her store she\u2019s been building up, the collection of singular coffee beans, flavor profiles of different years, she\u2019ll win it big. Be the Prime Aggressor, the know-it-all expert that doles out the insults. Retribution, while knowing she\u2019s got the upper hand. Her trophy would say so. Show them she was right all along.\nShe can\u2019t wait.\nAva has on the brown vest and the green cap. She looks the part, the appraiser to assess the art\u2019s value. With Ava\u2019s goading, Denise pushed out a rumor not affiliated with her lab about an upcoming discovery. Now the physics-related artwork prices are in flux, climbing, and acquirers are lapping eagerly at these pieces.\nArt follows innovation and social trends. It wasn\u2019t always like this\u2014art used to be a place for a break and dissension. Now it\u2019s all come together. The companies are always eager to enumerate their assets and to upgrade their financial standing as to win over investors into their savvy businesses. Corps thrive on money, power, and a sense of prestige, and they\u2019re always trying innovative ways to marry art and business and capitalize off their cultural relevance to get more of those three things they\u2019re always pining after. They commission and buy art, and artists seem all too happy to be their puppets. After all, some of this new tech art isn\u2019t cheap, needs a wad of digidollars for production.\nThe satellite company, K-Squared, invited Ava in right away, as Denise helped her forge the ID of their typical appraisal company.\nAva\u2019s hand is sweating over the orb and she wipes it in her pocket. The orb\u2019s data file\u2019s been purged. She gulps, envisions her goal\u2014holding the food champ trophy\u2014and walks over to the guard.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to see the management. I\u2019m the appraiser you called in.\u201d\nFor a moment, she hesitates, but collects herself as they do a skinscan. Ava had the skin files printed over her and she\u2019s standing in it, in some made-up employee\u2019s skin that Denise dumped into their system, fighting the urge to squirm, feeling out of sorts. The machine beeps a yes and she\u2019s ushered into the exhibition.\nAva hasn\u2019t been in an art exhibition for a while and is surprised to see that the same aesthetic is still in. For all the changes in tech art, you\u2019d think there would be more drastic changes to display. But, nope, a quick assessment confirms. Museum-like exhibitions are still the same. White walls, glass. As if that was the only way to present things.\nIt turns out that the Munchkin Collider, as it\u2019s called, isn\u2019t the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The real jewel of the exhibition is a reconstruction of a model of K-Squared\u2019s main satellite, but cloned and spliced with bee genes, where tiny satellites buzz about in a multi-holed hive-planet model of a world. A friendly reminder of a future or alternate world where the satellites are all too relevant.\nAva works her way over to the corner, where she\u2019s spotted the piece. Exactly as she saw it on Denise\u2019s encrypted holowaves film. A loop, just a small cooking pan lid, but what it represents is much more remarkable. Even if she\u2019s disappointed that the piece isn\u2019t getting the limelight, she\u2019s glad it\u2019s not the main display. It\u2019ll attract a lot less attention and the less fidgety the administrators, the better.\nShe\u2019s got her flexisack open, full of scanners, surface assessors, and intel checks when she hears footsteps behind her.\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Yumei, the curator.\u201d Ava curses under her breath. Wasn\u2019t there a talk she was supposed to be giving today, like right now?\nMust\u2019ve been cancelled.\nAva makes a few hand gestures (hidden away from the cameras that she\u2019s spotted) to activate the alert to Denise. Denise must have stepped away from the control center of her apartment\u2019s living room. Ava could\u2019ve used a warning.\nAnd some alcohol to loosen her nerves.\nAva smiles the way she does when has to confront a customer. Reassuring. She hopes it\u2019s convincing. Yumei is a tall figure with hunched shoulders as she peers down at people like she peers down at her art subjects. She has high arched brows that appear as if they\u2019re constantly questioning. It\u2019s hard to tell what she\u2019s thinking.\n\u201cI\u2019m the appraiser, Song.\u201d Ava flashes a security wave that brightens the room and then dims. With that, the voltonic light extinguishes, so Ava knows she can\u2019t pull that stunt off again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here early.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we had a change in the scheduling. My company sent the update a week ago.\u201d\nYumei walks up to the glass stand and lifts the case. An alarm goes off and she says the safe string of numbers and letters along to tonal cues, which silences it.\nThere it is, the model particle collider that makes a perfect ground bean.\nAva feels goose bumps under her fake skin. She\u2019s glad the appraiser outfit is equipped with long sleeves.\n\u201cThis is a beautiful piece we commissioned from Victor Lang. Titanium-lelum alloy, true-to-scale with some artistic reinterpretations. This year, so it probably hasn\u2019t accrued worth from sitting around. But, well, we\u2019ve heard the rumors . . . \u201d\nYumei pauses, her arched brows directed at Ava as if fishing for more.\n\u201cWell, can\u2019t comment on the rumors in the physics realm, but let\u2019s just say that the particle collider types are doing quite well.\u201d\nAva picks up the piece delicately, with the smart fabric lighting various colors as it takes in the weight and attributes.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope so. We paid fifty-five mil for it.\u201d\nFifty-five mil! Ava\u2019s hand shakes and slips. And she catches the piece with deft diner-experienced precision before it falls further.\nYumei eyes her warily. \u201cAre you really\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, Munchkin Collider passed the gravitational pull test,\u201d Ava lies. Her hand is steady now, as she collects herself. \u201cNow, to do a few more. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to undergo some more innovative appraisal checks. Some of these are harmful to the eyes and I have my reflectocontacts in, but it looks like you don\u2019t.\nAva turns her eyes blue with cerulean stripes. The world around her becomes monochrome.\nYumei says, without a hitch, \u201cI would be happy to oblige. But, for precaution\u2019s sake, I\u2019d like another appraiser security wash just to be sure.\u201d\nAva\u2019s heart thumps in her body. She\u2019s got no more juice left in the security wave that guaranteed her ID. It was exhausted in one go. She was lucky to even be able to procure that much of the industry-specific light.\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll emit that in a second, after I finish this test,\u201d says Ava, her voice steady and calm, as she practiced. She pulls out a second layer scanner and runs it past the object. \u201cDon\u2019t want it to disrupt the results of this one. The surface looks freshly done, but there are a few nicks I see that might detract from the final value.\u201d\n\u201cUndoubtedly from the trial runs of smashing at the conference,\u201d says Yumei. She looks deadpan, like the idea of hitting things together doesn\u2019t bemuse her the least.\nAva breathes out. At least this scan bought her time. \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d Ava repeats. \u201cComes with the territory, I suppose. All the collider models have to be constantly re-detailed.\u201d\nShe\u2019s sending out a sneak comm to Denise, now. Where is that girl? She can\u2019t stall much longer, and the air is starting to get stuffy. She is getting hot under this second faux skin.\nA vibration goes up her hand. Denise reassuring her that she\u2019s back. Ava says quickly, \u201cI\u2019m getting some interesting genetic signals. I\u2019ll have to match that with my database. It will only take a minute or two.\u201d\nYumei narrows her eyes at Ava. Something she said didn\u2019t jibe. Ava can tell. In her head, she groans. She remembers the other holoclips that Denise sent. Ones where Victor Lang is winking, smug. Maybe the eels weren\u2019t genetically enhanced after all. Maybe Victor Lang was just coming on to Denise, making up lies. Maybe . . .\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if we ever checked your bag. Did we scan\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d says Ava, implying that she herself was scanned, and not her bag. That\u2019s not a lie.\nIn her bag is a replica. They tried to get it as true to form as possible, hiring black market for imposter pieces that they put together themselves, so there will be no trace of the whole thing intact. Ava used the same payment methods for some of her more difficult to collect coffee beans that faced border restrictions.\nOutside there\u2019s a commotion. They start and look out through the windows. One of the foam security hydrant\u2019s gone off, sending foam everywhere. Sometimes the electric net frames that power the city get a glitch and require the foam to prevent the glitch from spreading, but it\u2019s a rare sight. Passersby pull up their wrists to film it.\n\u201cContinue your tests. I\u2019ll be right back,\u201d says Yumei. She heads out, probably checking to make sure the glitch hasn\u2019t spread to the front of the K-Squared quarters.\nThank you, Denise, Ava whispers under her breath. Denise must have worked her charm with some other hacker to get that done, since Ava\u2019s pretty sure the city grid is out of her league, but Denise has some discreet friends in high places. Ava slips out a small needle from under her faux skin. It releases a variation of the security light that short-circuits the cameras and feeds them false footage.\nShe executes the exchange\u2014her fake for the real Victor Lang\u2014and makes a quick calculation of value from an algorithm Denise threw together. Ava sends out a message to Yumei with the information. The good thing is, they\u2019re probably right about the value. Ava just couldn\u2019t get the numbers before the scans were complete and the estimate came in. The fifty-five mil took her by surprise\u2014something that should not have happened. The figure highlighted on her wrist screen tells her it\u2019s worth almost double now, with rumors spreading of the physics discovery abound. The physics and art worlds were abuzz with hearsay.\nWhile the repair drones fly in for the glitch, filling the air with their helicopter buzz, Ava takes her leave. The guard is only half paying attention, his head twisted at the scene outside, and he makes some comment about it. That works in her favor as the empty data orb is now filled with a physical object\u2014the irreplaceable Victor Lang. They weren\u2019t totally sure if this last part would work, but the scan pauses at Ava\u2019s data orb. A red so quick and imperceptible flashes to green and the guard is still chatting away with Ava about his son\u2019s allergies to the foam they use for purging the electric net, completely oblivious, and Ava nods, not daring to wipe away the cold sweat running down her real neck. The faux skin that\u2019s over it is so hot she can\u2019t wait to peel it off.\nThe last thing Ava sees is the security guard stepping outside, locking up the exhibition for the moment. He\u2019s watching the foam spurt and spurt and Ava runs the opposite way, sweating in skin that\u2019s not hers, away from the repair drones, away from the satellites that gather way too much data, and the sterilized world of art display, where all the backdrop are white and glass.\nAva and Denise celebrate with virtual cheers and hugs. Denise is still strapped with her lab so she can\u2019t get away, so they settle with breaking champagne and experimentation. Ava plays around with it, exploding beans she\u2019s been collecting for years, ones that she didn\u2019t dare roast conventionally with the unevenness of the heat-infusion tech. She really does think there\u2019s an electric eel splice in there somewhere, the seared pulverized result is perfectly roasted, and smooth to the smell, reminding her of the sleek agility and full body of an eel swimming around in a fish tank, a site she witnessed as a kid at an aquarium long ago.\nAva pulverizes enough beans for a cup and places them in a tiny data orb that she zaps clean. She takes it to a specialized centrifuge in the dead of the night, on a holiday so there is no peep of a researcher. It\u2019s a food lab she has connections with through her multiple jobs, the ones she worked when she used to be a food taster for mechanical production and quit (so sick of tasting fake foods that she went in a blaze, telling her supervisor the foods were really all bland) and took on her many barista jobs in her pursuit for the best coffee. Ava incorrectly assumed that the real service world would provide real food that would animate her appetite-yearning soul. But, it was still chock-full of mediocre, and often worse. The lady who works the centrifuge facility owes her one, a colleague who does accounting. Ava had helped her son get into the right institution for specialized sensory assessors, giving him tips on how to really smell things and compose quantifiable data from the qualitative nose. Now all those experiences feel a lifetime away, as she trudges over, the only real delightful smell she\u2019s smelled in what feels like decades safely tucked in her bag.\nAva disinfects and polishes the centrifuge herself. A sound stops her work. Again. There it is. She stops breathing.\nIn the hallway. The sinking shuffling of footsteps. They stop at the door. No one\u2019s supposed to be here.\nShe waits for them to pass, but whoever it is doesn\u2019t. She uses her smell vac and pulls in the particles of the coffee, praying for the machine to finish quickly. At least the smell vac is dead silent.\nThe footsteps move on. Ava drops her shoulders in relief, but she knows she\u2019s not in the clear, not until she gets out of there.\nThe centrifuge\u2019s no ordinary one. It\u2019s got calibrators that focus on speed and pressure, while it maintains all the olfactory particles intact with a vacuum seal that\u2019s near-impenetrable. All the research for her java creation pays off. As it finally finishes and the seal opens up, she can smell it\u2014liquid, cascading like a trickle of a waterfall, that beautiful, dark cup of joe dripping into the container orb. She wafts the aromas away from the door.\nThe liquid swashes about in the orb in her bag as she tidies everything up and vacs the aromas so there\u2019s not a trace. She leaves as silent as she came, deploying the noise cancellers that she installed on the surface of the container orb, so they move quietly along like criminals in the night. The noise cancellers should last until she gets out of the facility, or so she hopes.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some damn good smelling coffee,\u201d says Denise. She\u2019s still fussing with data orbs. It turns out there really was a breakthrough at some other lab and she\u2019s trying to keep up with the news.\n\u201cI think the words you\u2019re searching for are \u2018divinely fragrant, with touches of cranberry and a hint of the acidity of lemon, though far from overbearing,\u2019\u201d says Ava.\n\u201cLike I said, \u2018damn good,\u2019\u201d says Denise.\n\u201cOkay, good enough for me.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s it taste?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s so ridiculously marvelous, I can\u2019t bear drinking more than a sip,\u201d says Ava. \u201cIt\u2019s silly, just a cup of joe, right? But, it\u2019s the absolute best cup of joe there is. Half of me wants to just gulp it down in one go and laugh and cry from the buzz. But, another part of me knows that it\u2019s staying in my keeppouch until the submissions open for Grub Howls.\u201d\n\u201c . . . Food Champs on the Prowl!\u201d says Denise. \u201cYou think the aromas will stick?\u201d\n\u201cIn the keeppouch? Nothing degrades, not even the smell. You can trust me on that one.\u201d\n\u201cI trust your nose,\u201d says Denise, laughing. \u201cYou know, Ava, sometimes I think you\u2019re really twisted, but sometimes I think that twistedness comes from a one-track mind that just does what it wants.\u201d\n\u201cAnd sometimes I think that you deserve a lot more than you get\u2014like your own principal investigator funds, some minions of your own. Maybe the incompetent ones that work with you . . . \u201d Ava trails off as Denise stops her.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, but then I\u2019ll be too high-profile to go scraping around the muckier side of things for a celestial sip of coffee.\u201d\n\u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d says Ava.\n\u201cOof,\u201d says Denise as Ava watches an unmarked drone carrier that passed through Denise\u2019s lab window drop a package in her lap.\n\u201cIs this what I think\u2014?\u201d cries Denise, ripping it open. The drone flies away.\nInside is a marble, full of a deep brown liquid.\n\u201cYour cut of the share. Not enough to sustain you day after day, but it\u2019ll sustain your soul knowing that this exists. I\u2019ll get you more when I can.\u201d\n\u201cShould I drink it?\u201d\n\u201cHell, yeah? Get that down.\u201d\nShe opens it, takes a whiff. Even without the enhancing functionality of the sniff horn in place, Ava can smell the waft of that powerful liquid coming through the holowaves.\nDenise calls out the password, which opens up a slit. She places her lips against the marble, tilts her head back, and she looks as if she\u2019ll just melt into her chair.\nAva smiles. \u201cDamn good?\u201d\nFor a moment, Denise doesn\u2019t respond. Her eyes flutter open as she shuts the lid of the marble. \u201cI see it now. Why you go to great lengths just to get this. It\u2019s transcendental.\u201d\n\u201cA quantum ecstatic state,\u201d says Ava.\n\u201cSure, I think it just atom smashed my heart,\u201d says Denise. And they both laugh.\nK-Squared exhibition doors still remain open. Ava manages to dig up information about the exhibition, especially on details like when they\u2019re moving out the exhibition. She marks the date and when it comes, she strikes again, this time doing a switch-back. No one needs to know she took the machine, and besides, the newest version she crafted and tweaked from its specs works even better than the original. So back the original goes and she\u2019s going to collect the dummy before any new scientific achievements crop up to pitch the artwork toward another appraisal.\nShe poses as one of the workers, slipping in and out, using deft hands and a number of blinders to scramble the signals as she works. The other workers are too busy handling the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance satellite beehive and other notable works of art more high-profile than hers.\nNobody has figured out the switch.\nThere\u2019s someone new in Denise\u2019s office when she calls. A supervisor, who constantly provides encouragement for Denise\u2019s work. Even now, Ava sees a holomessage highlighting Denise\u2019s contribution to the team. Ava doesn\u2019t know if this is the reason, but recently Denise has been talking about applying for some fellowships, voicing interest in testing out some experiments she\u2019s kept on back-burners.\nAva chats with Denise as usual, but inside she\u2019s mystified as to why all these years her nudging hasn\u2019t worked, but now all of a sudden, Denise\u2019s open to change. Maybe Ava spent too much time belittling her rivals. She always thought she pointed out Denise\u2019s strong points, but perhaps it wasn\u2019t obvious in her disparagement of her competition.\nBut, Denise looks happy.\nMaybe, just maybe, it\u2019s the miracle of that sip of coffee.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Ava gets the coffee award. A giant holographic bean beaming out of a 4x6 crown-shaped trophy. The award is accompanied by contracts for her appearance on Grub Howls and tasting notes that beg her to make public her recipe, offering her grand payments for its divulgence.\nNot going to do it, Ava decides, but the grand prize isn\u2019t too shabby. No more waiting on tables and being the on-the-fly pourer of terrible coffee for the customers.\nStarting next month, she will shine.\nAva scrawls out a few diagrams of how she\u2019ll approach the show. She\u2019s still trying to figure out how to rain terror on these baristas effectively so that they\u2019ll change their recipe. At least try something that\u2019ll come close to the actual aroma of coffee. A public persona of showering insults is how she\u2019s always imagined it, but now her view\u2019s starting to change.\nDenise\u2019s blowing up. Getting big. It wasn\u2019t her team that had the big breakthrough in physics during the whole appraisal fiasco, but Denise keeps hinting there\u2019s good news coming her way.\nAnd one day she makes the announcement.\nShe got the fellowship and her review comments are all exceptional.\nAva takes a tiny sip of that original drink, making sure to siphon out the sip without exposing the rest to air. There\u2019s still some of it left. The original \u201ctrue coffee\u201d coffee. She\u2019ll make more, she knows. She\u2019s improved on the design of bean collider. Tinkered around with the acceleration speeds and the materials. Also added a collection vac to it all, so all the aroma and ground debris can be retained for the final brew.\nAva smiles as she hears Victor Lang announcing on the holowaves a not-insignificant sum donated to his person. Coffee money, she thinks. He deserves it. Most of Victor\u2019s money he gets from satellite art commissions gets locked up in stocks, and there are stipulations on how long he needs to hold them before sale. Even with the crazy high value of the artwork, very little actually shows up in Victor\u2019s pockets. If commissioned artists pull out the money, they\u2019re coerced into redirecting them into the foundations that K-Squared set up. All these exploitative practices that Ava looked up. She knows with a sense of satisfaction that Victor is probably pretty happy with this money not associated with the company that owns his life with all those signed contracts.\nAva stays awake late every night still collecting, tinkering. Making the centrifuge and collider better. Setting up contacts across oceans for better beans and stretches of land growth. She\u2019s never revealed that the micronized coffee grinds are all done by collider, but she has mentioned that she explodes the bean into a powder with a secret technique.\nEven Food Blink holomag calls her \u201cThe First Great Female Molecular Gastronomic Celebrity Chef.\u201d With a photo of her on the front cover, her hands covered in brown pulverized dust, her lips blowing it at the reader. They say she\u2019s \u201cthe one\u201d everyone\u2019s been waiting for, the one who broke into the boys\u2019 club of food, gadgets, and geekery. On the timeline scroll-through, they show the parade of male chefs throughout the contemporary culinary sphere: masters of sous vide, foams, dehydration techniques, flash-freezing, spherification\u2014then her, breaking the tradition of males, with the caption of her method: maximum pulverized centrifugal drip (for brewed drinks and decoctions).\nAt her first shooting of Grub Howls, she shouts and screams at the personnel. But, behind the scenes, they laugh and drink coffee. Her resentment starts to dissipate; even old grudges slowly fade as they share sips of incredible coffee. The magazines must be on to her\u2014caf\u00e9 staff must be leaking that there\u2019s an angelic side to this food snob demon with her hair-raising outrage, since they\u2019re looking past her dark side and highlighting the bright. \u201cThe Golden Face to a Dark Brew.\u201d \u201cThe Sparkly Java Guru.\u201d\nAva puts her feet up in the back alley where they\u2019ve stacked chairs. The video crew is taking a break, puffing out some e-smoke. She sits with some of her old coworkers, friends from years ago. (Were they friends? They sure seem like it, she thinks. Even good ol\u2019 Manager Martin shows up to do a pretty spot-on imitation of her celebrity persona.) They sip and sip\u2014the aroma of bittersweetness fills the air. And she\u2019s reminded of the time they took her shift or went out to pick up more stirrers when she was running busy. It wasn\u2019t all bad, she concedes, letting her mind drift as the steam hits her face.\nSomeone refills her mug with some of the crap from the kitchen. Bitter, burned, and bland, all at once. One day it\u2019ll be great, she thinks.\nIt will totally be great. Already her coffee boom takes off\u2014starting literally with that sweet redolent glorious boom of an aromatic collision.\nD.A.

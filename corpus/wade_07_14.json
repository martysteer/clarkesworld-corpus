One among these was a mortal, Ruver of Meluara, renowned for his strength and speed. As many times as she rebuffed him, yet Ruver persisted in his suit, until at last, despairing of further talk, Eyn turned her back and resumed her exploration through the orbits of the dark unknown. Ruver followed running, and coming upon her from behind, cried out her name and caught in his bare hand the tips of her wild white hair. Yet Eyn had already cast off her mortal guise, and the touch of her hair struck Ruver dead.\nIn terrible anger did Eyn bear Ruver\u2019s body back, and placing him before Father Varin, demanded his soul be gnashed in flame for this presumption. Yet then did Mother Elinda touch her with a gentling hand, and bid her look back across the distance to the place where Ruver had died. \u201cHe did wrong to follow you, yet see how far he reached beyond the deeds of other mortals.\u201d\nAt this, Eyn relented, and gave Ruver\u2019s soul to Mother Elinda, who placed him in the heavens as a shining star. Eyn declared, \u201cLet his light serve as a reminder to all mortals that great things may be achieved in the name of love.\u201d\nAs her assistant Irim finished his reading, Pelisma glanced instinctively toward him, but her failing vision could no longer distinguish him from the vague shadows. Even the bright electric lights on the ceiling gave nothing but a faint glimmer. She ached to think that not so long ago, limestone labyrinths had been her playgrounds. Now she had to rub the velvet of the couch she sat on to feel grounded again.\n\u201cGroundbreaker, you seem distressed,\u201d Irim said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but think of your deeds when I read this passage this morning. Was I wrong to guess that you\u2019re a ward of Eyn?\u201d\nPelisma shook her head. \u201cNo, Irim; I am.\u201d Though she\u2019d long since lost the habit of attending chapel, her life\u2019s work in building this cavern city had been born of love. She cherished her vivid memory of the day the river Trao changed course through a sinkhole and came thundering in at the gate. A heart-shattering, magnificent sight! She\u2019d mustered the citizens, set explosives, and blasted a new outlet to save the city from inundation. In return, the city\u2019s Firstmost had appointed her Groundbreaker, and renamed the city of Lake\u2019s Gate: Pelismara, in her honor.\nNow that she considered it, she hadn\u2019t entirely left behind Eyn\u2019s inspiration. Surely the goddess would be disappointed in her now, though\u2014bound by her people\u2019s adulation and her own blindness into tiny orbits that held nothing but the known.\nA light brightened on her right, and she tried not to flinch.\nAlmost nothing.\n\u201cIrim,\u201d she asked, \u201cIs there a wysp nearby?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Irim. \u201cThat was me; I moved out from between you and the lamp. There\u2019s a wysp in the room, but it\u2019s currently drifting near the window.\u201d\nShe shoved down the irrational fear and tried to change the subject. \u201cSo. What do we have in today\u2019s project updates?\u201d\nIrim\u2019s footsteps walked nearer, while paper rustled softly. \u201cGood news. Building the agricultural scaffolds around openings to the surface has been an unqualified success. With harvest numbers in, it looks like we can abandon those two surface fields that experienced wysp-fire disasters this year, without risking a citywide shortage.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cPelisma, I\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t mean to mention wysps. I hope I haven\u2019t alarmed you.\u201d\n\u201cNo, not really.\u201d Wysps were a fact of life. It wasn\u2019t their existence that filled her with dread, so much as their new unpredictable behavior\u2014approaching her closely, for no apparent reason. She\u2019d never felt superstitious about floating sparks she could see. \u201cIrim,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re following me.\u201d\nIrim\u2019s hand gently touched her forearm, a habit he\u2019d developed for which she was unreasonably grateful. \u201cPerhaps they follow you out of love,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Ruver followed Eyn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Pelisma glanced toward him, and ended up frowning at shadows. Irim reading from the Books was no surprise\u2014he was kind and devout, qualities she\u2019d always appreciated. But why should he cast her wysp problem in religious terms? Unless . . . \u201cIrim,\u201d she said, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me asking, but are you a sectarian?\u201d\nIrim gave a nervous laugh. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve got me. Heretic, yes.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m trying to understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\nThe couch cushion creaked as Irim sat beside her. \u201cGroundbreaker, I\u2014well, you\u2019ve saved so many lives. I believe it would be natural for souls to be drawn to you.\u201d\nSouls. Then the rumors about sectarians were true. Imagine the lonely dead, not placed in Elinda\u2019s care where they belonged, but taking the form of wysps and drifting through people\u2019s lives. Approaching them. Threatening and killing them? She shuddered, feeling suddenly as though a pit gaped beneath her feet.\nFrom a rational perspective, she should ask Irim questions, and let him explain how his faith addressed her fears. But right now, she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle a theological argument. Losing her eyesight had been difficult enough; lately it seemed she was also losing her composure.\nIf she couldn\u2019t stay rational, she would no longer be worthy of her post\u2014and if she could no longer work for her people, for Pelismara, then what would her life be worth?\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of you to say so,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe I\u2019d like to see my physician about this wysp issue.\u201d\n\u201cDoctor Olanen?\u201d Irim asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nPelisma rubbed her fingers over the couch velvet, so solid and certain. A life of cave work had taught her the solid reliability of limestone walls, level rampways and buttresses, atmospheric lamps and ventilators. Wysps were incorporeal, and thus trickier, but they had been observed in detail. Tracking their behaviors in the mines and fields had significantly reduced the risk of wysp fires. Since she could no longer make such observations herself, she must ask someone to do it for her. How else could she banish this fear?\nNot wishing to insult Irim, she said, \u201cI\u2019d just like to hear his opinion. Please, Irim.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Groundbreaker. I\u2019ll call him at once.\u201d\nPelisma sat still in her brass chair during her doctor\u2019s examination, re-analyzing every wysp experience she could recall. In the city-caverns, wysps came and went without harm, and mostly without notice. In the wild cavern systems outside the city boundaries, any wysp appearance spurred quick checks of the methane detectors, but only rarely did they cause explosions. Thinking of it, she could almost feel the tremors in her bones.\nWysps were everywhere; they could appear anywhere, often emerging out of solid rock. But what might cause them to appear?\nAs he had for the last year, Doctor Olanen always began by shining bright lights into her eyes from various directions. Then he checked her chest, back, and neck with gentle hands\u2014the same routine that always left her feeling old and infirm. Shouldn\u2019t it have been different this time? She\u2019d told him to look for wysp attraction factors, not heart murmurs!\nThe doctor\u2019s hands moved away, and Irim\u2019s breathing quickened. Pelisma sat straighter in her chair, because Groundbreakers didn\u2019t bend with bad news.\n\u201cYes, Doctor?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Doctor Olanen. \u201cI can\u2019t detect any change in your physical condition that might attract wysps. Your general health is excellent, and you\u2019ll be happy to hear that your retinal deterioration is slowing.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d She tried to keep her tone light. \u201cThank Heile for mercy.\u201d\nIrim touched her forearm, and instantly, she thought of souls. The stars kept to their orbits, so it was written; they cared for themselves far above, beyond the layers of rock and wilderness. Wysps, though, were unpredictable. Not entirely unlike the living . . .\nOh, heavenly Mother Elinda!\nDoctor Olanen cleared his throat. \u201cGroundbreaker, are you sure the wysps\u2019 behavior changed after your vision trouble began?\u201d\n\u201cYes, absolutely sure. Irim would be able to tell you the precise timing. Please, Irim?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Irim. \u201cThe wysps started approaching her closely about two months after the vision loss began restricting her routines. At first we didn\u2019t realize the phenomenon was systematic. Only recently did we think back and realize that they\u2019d been drifting in more frequently for some time.\u201d\n\u201cSo you have witnessed this yourself,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cNot to suggest that our Groundbreaker is imagining things, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI most certainly have witnessed it.\u201d Irim sounded indignant. \u201cHaunting behaviors are well-documented. Have you spoken with the survivors of wysp incidents, Doctor?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve treated plenty of wysp burns,\u201d Doctor Olanen replied, brusquely. \u201cThey\u2019re hunting behaviors, and they are well documented, but only on the surface. Underground, wysps drift randomly. You\u2019re telling me the Groundbreaker is somehow witnessing an anomaly never recorded in more than two hundred years?\u201d\nIrim replied quietly. \u201cIn two hundred years, there has been no one like our Groundbreaker.\u201d\nPelisma winced.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Irim touched her forearm soothingly, but then hissed in a breath. Even without the faint new glimmer in her sight, she knew wysps were near.\n\u201cHow many?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cThree,\u201d said Doctor Olanen. \u201cThey\u2019re small, but quite\u2014uh, bright.\u201d\n\u201cThey generally are,\u201d she agreed. \u201cAre they drifting, or moving closer?\u201d\nNo one answered. Bodies scuffled, and someone\u2014Irim?\u2014yelped. Pelisma opened her mouth to ask what was happening, but impatience seized her so suddenly she held her breath.\nRidiculous, this whole thing! None of us know anything! What can I do? What do the wysps want? Can they want? I have to do something\u2014have to, just have to figure this out!\nA cold stethoscope pressed against her chest. She shuddered, gulped down the feeling and managed to say something without seeming irrational.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Irim, sounding shaken. \u201cThey\u2019re gone now.\u201d\nNot permanently, she didn\u2019t imagine. \u201cIrim, are you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Groundbreaker. I tried to block one getting too close to you, and it floated straight through me\u2014may Mother Elinda stay her hand.\u201d\n\u201cDid any of them touch me?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you assess me again, Doctor?\u201d\n\u201cIts proximity seemed to alarm you,\u201d Doctor Olanen replied. \u201cBeyond a slightly elevated heart rate, though, everything is normal.\u201d\nPelisma took a deep breath, and rubbed the cold brass of her chair. There was no question of uttering the words \u2018increasing emotional instability\u2019 in the presence of her doctor, if he already thought she was imagining things.\n\u201cDoctor Olanen, you saw that, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Irim said. \u201cDo you feel inclined to alter your professional opinion?\u201d\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t say based on a single observation,\u201d the doctor replied. \u201cI confess, that\u2019s not a behavior I\u2019ve seen before. Wysp burns fall within my expertise, but their behaviors do not. I\u2019d like to report it to a colleague of mine who researches wysps in Herketh. She might be able to shed more light on the problem.\u201d\nSudden inspiration brought Pelisma to her feet. \u201cA researcher\u2014perfect! I\u2019ll go speak with her.\u201d\nIrim seemed flustered by the suggestion. \u201cGroundbreaker, why not order her to come to you? If wysps seek you out during the surface voyage, we have no idea what they might do. Caution is recommended.\u201d\nUntil this moment, caution had been all she had. \u201cIrim, it\u2019s only five hours travel before we\u2019ll be back underground in Herketh, and I\u2019ve never heard of a wysp entering a moving vehicle. We\u2019ll have no cause to clear land or build fires. Besides, I know I\u2019ll be safe if you\u2019re with me.\u201d\n\u201cPelisma\u2014\u201d\nShe smiled. \u201cI will even let you drive.\u201d\nAt last, some action! This was much better than foundering in anxiety and despair. As Eyn was her witness, she\u2019d prefer to face danger out on the surface, if it meant she was still alive.\nIrim was quieter than usual today as he led her out to their vehicle. Nervous about the surface voyage, he said\u2014but recent advances in hover technology meant that floater travel had not been seriously dangerous for a number of years. His reticence felt weightier than that, laden with the unspoken question that now lay between them.\nUnbearable. Every second made her more impatient to leave this awkwardness for the adventure of surface travel. Had he known her feelings, Irim would probably have said she was more like Eyn than ever.\nIrim helped her out to the edge of the open square, and laid her left hand on the flat cold metal of the floater car while he opened the door.\n\u201cGroundbreaker,\u201d he said, \u201care you sure we should be doing this?\u201d\n\u201cWe must do something, Irim. I don\u2019t prefer to wait and see whether a wysp finally sets me on fire.\u201d\n\u201cMercy!\u201d Irim said. \u201cThat\u2019s true enough.\u201d He guided her into the passenger\u2019s seat.\nPelisma stroked the soft fabric of her seat, and tried to distract herself. \u201cCould you update me on the latest construction, please? How does it look? Is our residence still so lonely?\u201d\n\u201cNot quite,\u201d Irim replied, with more cheer. \u201cWe\u2019ll be neighbors with lawyers and judges soon. They\u2019ve started on the Court columns, and it looks like they\u2019ll match our portico. With the shinca trunk lighting up the whole square, I think it will be beautiful.\u201d\nPelisma smiled in relief, imagining it. The shinca tree had been what first drew her to this cavern for the residence of the Firstmost and top staff: alone in the center of a flat basin, it pierced through the ceiling stalactites, reaching up toward its branches on the surface far above. Its silver-white glow sharpened everything around, while its warmth softened the chill of the deep regions.\nOnce Irim had engaged her seatbelt, he moved across to the driver\u2019s side. The other seatbelt clicked, and then the vehicle hummed and lifted. They drove up the rampway to the fourth level.\n\u201cLots of construction here, too,\u201d Irim said. \u201cYou just wait; this will be the center of town one day.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d she agreed, but as the vehicle angled up one rampway after another, and the sounds of life and business grew louder, she couldn\u2019t help feeling dissatisfied. Is this all the ambition we have left? To beautify and perfect a confined existence? It was all the wysps\u2019 doing. The fear that now pursued her was the same fear that kept all of Pelismara below ground: a terrifying vision of death by unquenchable flame.\nIrim couldn\u2019t be right. What possible wrongs could inspire the dead to visit such punishments upon the living? All her studies, and every event in her life converged upon one fundamental truth: that there was nothing so destructive, nor so implacable as nature, and that meant wysps must be a part of it.\nShe could feel it as they drove out. Yrindonna Forest rippled all around them, trackless except for the radio-transmitting waymarkers that allowed a driver to track direction while skirting dense thickets and enormous trees that could not be safely cleared away. The hiss of vegetation brushing against the floater\u2019s roof and windows roused vivid memories of her last surface drive\u2014the time they\u2019d flushed a flock of kanguan, or that graceful, muscular oryen that had leapt out so close to their path . . .\nLulled by the floater\u2019s weaving motions, she\u2019d been drifting in and out of sleep for probably two hours when Irim swore.\n\u201cVarin\u2019s teeth! Oryen!\u201d\nThe vehicle swerved, flinging her into her seatbelt. They hit something\u2014a horrible crack came from Irim\u2019s side of the floater, the vehicle rebounded at a strange angle, and suddenly they were spinning wildly. Pelisma clutched her seat.\nMake it stop, make it stop, oh, make it stop!\nThey slammed side-first into something solid. The windshield shattered, pelting her face, body and hands with chunks of glass.\nPelisma still held on, sick and disoriented, half-choking on the pounding of her heart. Had they really stopped spinning at last? She found her voice.\n\u201cIrim?\u201d\nIrim didn\u2019t answer.\n\u201cIrim! Oh, Elinda forbear!\u201d Grief and fear rose as if to drown her, but she forced them down. No sentimentality, now: his side of the floater was hit twice, but he might not be dead. She fumbled for her seatbelt, and managed to release it. Reaching across the space between them, she found Irim\u2019s leg: warm, sprinkled with chunks of glass. Carefully, she felt her way up his body. He was slumped against the far side of the floater, which had bowed inward.\n\u201cIrim, can you hear me? If you can hear me, make a sound.\u201d\nThe only answer was birdsong, wafting in on a cold breeze heavy with the complex scent of invisible green. Irim\u2019s neck was wet with blood, but when she probed with her fingers, his neck and skull seemed unbroken.\nThere was a pulse beneath his jawline.\nPelisma gasped in relief. She should try to bandage the cut, or cuts, on his head . . . No; first, she should radio for help so someone at least knew they were in trouble . . .\nShe sniffed.\nSmoke?\nShe searched the air with her hands. Intense heat was coming from the rear of the floater, just where the fire extinguisher was supposed to be. Fire\u2014and it was growing fast, which meant wysps would come.\nI can\u2019t leave Irim here.\nHer fingers shook, but by Sirin\u2019s grace, the driver-side seatbelt gave her no trouble. Pelisma gulped down panic and turned away, walking her hands across the dashboard to the passenger door. The latch clicked open easily enough, but the door was jammed. She threw her shoulder into it; on her second attempt, it popped open, and she shoved it outward. Already the smoke had her useless eyes stinging. By the time she got back to Irim, the air tasted thick. Coughing, she worked his nearer leg out of the seat, pulled at his arm and squatted to get him over her shoulders. Grip assured, she put her legs into getting him out. Some part of him was stuck; she heaved until her knees shook.\nSweet Heile, don\u2019t let me break him . . .\nAt last he came free, and she fell face-first into the passenger\u2019s seat.\nShe lay, panting and wheezing into the cloth. It was almost better here, but worse disaster was coming, and they might have only seconds. Thank heavens Irim was not a large man. Pelisma lifted him, but couldn\u2019t stand\u2014only managed to flop the two of them out the door into the brush. Bushy vegetation scratched at her face and hands, but the air was breathable. She wriggled out from under Irim and hauled at him again. Won them maybe a foot. Hauled again. A little more.\nThe fire was now a dreadful wall of heat, crackling and popping as it advanced. Surely it had already ignited whatever vines and leaves were about, possibly also the tree that they had struck. She fought for a better grip under Irim\u2019s shoulders and surged backward, two steps, three, four, then turned her ankle and fell with Irim\u2019s body across her legs.\nShe lay, chest heaving, limbs throbbing, waiting for death to find them.\nAll at once, the fire went out.\nWysps. Pelisma held her breath.\nIt was an eerie inverse of explosions underground. The wall of heat had vanished, as if sucked straight out of the universe. There was no more wild shapeless light; the hissing and popping had stopped. Pelisma put her arms around Irim as best she could. He was the one who had first explained to her the pattern of the survivor tales: having extinguished a wildfire, wysps could grow a hundredfold\u2014not merely identifying anyone close enough to have caused it, but pursuing them mercilessly and punishing them with flame, while leaving the wilderness untouched.\nOn the surface, wysps ruled absolutely.\nShe couldn\u2019t hold her breath any longer. She surrendered, breathing in loud gasps. Maybe she should have been angry to be delivered to the mercy of the wysps just when progress had seemed within reach, but all she could feel was remorse. For Irim\u2014thoughtful, faithful Irim, lying here in her lap about to die because of her own rashness.\nA flicker came into her vision. Not just a shift in the trees overhead, because it grew brighter, until her eyes filled with light. Mercy\u2014if she could see the wysps so well, imagine how big they must be! She tensed for the oncoming flames. Remorse swelled beyond measure, flooding her, drowning her.\nOh Irim I\u2019m so so sorry how could I have brought this upon you?\nIrim groaned.\n\u201cIrim!\u201d She sat convulsively, patting over his head, shoulders, and back as if to fight the wysp-flame\u2014but there was none. \u201cIrim,\u201d she cried. \u201cIrim, are you all right?\u201d\nThe weight of his head lifted. \u201cPelism . . . \u201d It turned into a sigh, and he fell back into her lap. But he wasn\u2019t screaming. There were no flames, and the light in her vision faded again to shadow.\nThe wysps had spared them. But why?\nIn the forest, there were no reasons. The ground felt like solid ice, leaching heat through her too-thin clothes. The air was a turbulent ocean of sound, in which she could detect nothing familiar. Pelisma rocked back and forth, stroking Irim\u2019s head. He was unconscious again, but he was warm. He was solid.\nShe was less so. Remorse, panic, hope and despair shuddered through her in waves.\nHelp us, o Wanderer, don\u2019t let us die here; bless our path, and show us a way to return!\nWhat if a predator smells our blood?\nElinda, don\u2019t take Irim from me! What will I do without him?\nThat sound\u2014could it be a vehicle? No, it must have been a bird\u2019s wings . . .\nAfter a thousand such waves, she could scarcely find words in her head to describe the tides overwhelming her reason. The air darkened, and the temperature continued to drop.\nWe\u2019re going to die . . .\n\u201cIrim,\u201d Pelisma called, shaking him. \u201cIrim, please.\u201d\nStill, he didn\u2019t answer. She leaned over him, sobbing, until she was too exhausted to continue. Long shuddering breaths didn\u2019t seem enough to pull her fully together.\nWhat had become of her ability to stay rational in the worst of situations? Even facing the cascade and the destruction of her city, she\u2019d been all focus, all action. But she had to face up to the truth. Since the blindness\u2014really, since the wysp problem\u2014she\u2019d been increasingly emotional. Maybe this was age affecting her mind . . .\nNo, you can\u2019t afford to say that. You\u2019re not dead so long as you can still think.\nWhy hadn\u2019t she thought of it before? Yrindonna forest was vast, and not all of its trees were cold. Shinca trees, too, had their crowns here, and those gave off warmth in every season.\nThough logic suggested there must be one somewhere nearby, she felt no evidence of heat in the air. Swirling breezes made it impossible to be sure what lay beyond the reach of her hands. That meant she\u2019d have to search, in such a way that she wouldn\u2019t lose Irim. She shifted his weight off her legs, and instantly felt ten times colder.\nHow can I leave him? What if I can\u2019t find him again? He\u2019ll die! I can\u2019t let Irim die\u2014\nIrim moaned.\n\u201cIrim!\u201d she cried. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\n\u201cPelisma . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cOh, blessing of Heile. We need to move, Irim, or we\u2019ll freeze. Can you move?\u201d\nHe grunted. \u201cI . . . can try. Where to?\u201d\n\u201cTell me if you can see the light of a shinca crown anywhere near.\u201d\nIrim was silent for several seconds. \u201cYes. I do.\u201d\n\u201cBut?\u201d\nHe panted a moment. \u201cYou know, we will have been expected in Herketh by now. They\u2019ll have sent back a radiogram and the Firstmost will send searchers to our last registered waymarker . . . \u201d\n\u201cIrim . . . \u201d She reached for his hand, and found it, sticky with blood. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we have time to wait.\u201d\nHe made an uncomfortable sound. \u201cShinca crowns attract wysps. More than you ever see in the city-caverns.\u201d\nMore chances to roll the same deadly dice. \u201cIrim, the wysps have left us alive so far,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe\u2014\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cMaybe we should consider that their mercy.\u201d\nThat silenced him. Finally he said, \u201cAll right.\u201d\nOn their first attempt to get him up, Pelisma lost her balance and nearly landed on top of him. Picking herself up for a second attempt, she braced herself better; Irim hissed in pain but managed to stand, leaning against her shoulder. They stumbled along for a few feet, but then she turned her bad ankle on a stone and fell to hands and knees, nearly bringing Irim down with her.\nCarefully, now. They couldn\u2019t afford a bad fall, or Irim wouldn\u2019t be able to get back up.\n\u201cLet\u2019s slow down,\u201d Pelisma said. \u201cDon\u2019t lose your balance trying to guide me; talk me through. Tell me what obstacles you see.\u201d\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\nShe reined herself to a creep, testing with her feet as though navigating a limestone tunnel with an uncertain floor. Irim\u2019s instructions were halting, and he often paused for words, but they were a way to navigate the uncertain dark. Slowly, so slowly, light grew around them.\n\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Irim panted. \u201cThere\u2019s a big fallen tree. Let me rest a second; we\u2019ll have to climb over.\u201d\nThey leaned against it for a moment. Its bark was rough, covered with ticklish moss. When Pelisma regained her breath, she felt her way over it. A wind came rushing through the forest, bringing with it the distinct wickering sound of wings. This time it also brought the breath of warmth that promised the presence of a shinca tree.\nNo sooner had she reached the other side than there was a sharp pain on her left wrist. She slapped her hand to it, and discovered the prickly body of a large insect between her fingers. Other tickles along her skin were suddenly explained; she tried to brush the bugs off, but they clung and bit, forcing her to crush them one by one. Heile\u2019s mercy but they could bite!\nSuddenly the sound of wings came at them in a rush.\n\u201cPelisma!\u201d Irim cried. He reached her, seizing her arm just as the flood rushed over them. Bird bodies bumped against her, wings struck, and feathers whipped against her face.\nThen they were gone.\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Irim asked.\n\u201cYes.\u201d In fact, there was a distinct improvement. \u201cI think they\u2019ve eaten those bugs.\u201d\n\u201cThere are thousands of birds,\u201d Irim said. \u201cThey\u2019re all perched up in the shinca\u2019s branches.\u201d The flood of wing-sounds began again, but this time grew quieter, as if the birds had gone off in another direction. \u201cA whole crowd of them just flew away, but more keep coming.\u201d\nShe could only guess from his tone that they must not look actively dangerous. \u201cPerhaps they need the warmth also,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we stay low beside the ground, I hope they will let us be.\u201d\n\u201cI hope so, too.\u201d\nNearer the shinca, her eyes filled with formless light. The ground felt softer, flat and springy with something that might have been moss. The green scent of it heightened with every step, and the warmth drew her nearer until she touched the shinca\u2019s glass-smooth trunk. Marvelous, marvelous heat! She set her back against it and sank down onto the moss.\nAhhhh!\nFor an instant, nothing existed in the world except heat, light, and the life pounding back into her frozen limbs.\n\u201cPelisma!\u201d Irim cried.\nShe shook herself, and tried to shove the feeling away\u2014but the warmth was too wonderful to ignore. \u201cIrim, are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cA wysp,\u201d he stammered. \u201cA wysp\u2014it came so close, and it was so big\u2014it was full of fire!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s been hours since our fire . . . \u201d Could it have been following her all this time? The thought made her shudder.\nAn explosion of wings burst from the shinca crown above, drawing an invisible arc in the forest air before them. Amidst it came a feral growl, and then a shriek, before the arc completed its circle behind their head.\nPelisma pressed her back harder against the shinca. Now was not the time to lose touch with reality. \u201cIrim, something is hunting the birds.\u201d\n\u201cCave-cat,\u201d Irim muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t see it clearly, but I doubt one bird will satisfy its appetite. We\u2019re not safe here.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we move? At least here, we have the shinca at our backs.\u201d A cave-cat was definitely fierce enough to overpower one old woman and one half-broken man. The only mercy was that it was tangible. What could anyone do against an intangible predator?\nHow small we are here! Lost, surrounded by wilderness, cut off from all human help, and that cave-cat could pounce any second\u2014we\u2019ll be erased\u2014\nThe lonely fear spiked, overwhelming her.\n\u201cGet!\u201d Irim snapped. \u201cGet away!\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cWysp,\u201d said Irim grimly. \u201cSame one I saw before\u2014it\u2019s bigger than my hand. Look, as far as the cave-cat goes, we\u2019ll be all right. The weapon I brought is still in my pocket. But for the wysp I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\n\u201cA weapon?\u201d That turned her stomach. \u201cIrim, that\u2019s dangerous!\u201d\n\u201cWhat choice do I have?\u201d\n\u201cCave-cat or no, an energy-thrower will only make the wysps more deadly.\u201d She cast about for something to give him pause. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re souls I failed to save in the Trao flood, and they\u2019re following me to take revenge?\u201d\nIrim grunted. \u201cI think you\u2019d be dead already.\u201d\nShe couldn\u2019t argue with that. \u201cStill, what if you miss the cat, and set the forest on fire instead? Our miraculous escape from the crash will be for nothing.\u201d\n\u201cGroundbreaker\u2014I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve escaped at all.\u201d\nSo he sensed it, too. She shivered despite the heat at her back. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThat giant wysp is still here. Hovering, like it\u2019s waiting for us to join it.\u201d He grunted in pain. \u201cAnd see? The cave-cat is back . . . \u201d\nIn her mind, the wysp seemed to be Mother Elinda\u2019s herald, announcing her intent to take their spirits into her peace-giving arms. Would she bear them upward to the heavens, or would they remain here to haunt their own city for eternity?\nI\u2019m not ready to die!\nIn defiance of the vision, she asked, \u201cCan you tell me what it looks like?\u201d\n\u201cWhat what looks like? The cat?\u201d\n\u201cThe wysp.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you care what it looks like?!\u201d\nHe sounded near panic. She reached out and found his arm\u2014unfortunately, not the one with the weapon. \u201cIrim, give me the weapon. Please.\u201d\n\u201cI should just shoot now. The cat\u2019s close enough.\u201d\nShe tightened her grip on his arm. \u201cThe wysps will kill you if you miss.\u201d\n\u201cHey, I know!\u201d he cried suddenly. \u201cI\u2019ll shoot the wysp!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not serious\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am. It\u2019s big enough to hit, and whatever discharge it creates should also scare the cat away.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cGroundbreaker, you know all about taking risks to defy the odds. When the river came into Pelismara, you stopped it with the most incredible explosion anyone had ever seen! Besides, I\u2019d happily give my life to save yours.\u201d\nHe must still be concussed, not thinking clearly; if the wysp survived the hit, it might easily kill them both. Will it be fire that destroys me? Or teeth and claws? No, she had to keep her head, not give in to fear . . . . \u201cIrim, please, humor a blind woman. Just tell me what the wysp looks like.\u201d\nIrim gave an exasperated sigh. \u201cIt looks like\u2014I guess, like a tangled ball of spider-silk set on fire.\u201d\nThe image blossomed unexpectedly in her head, a gorgeous conspiracy of memory and imagination. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d she murmured, and in an instant the feeling exploded out of her control.\nGreat heavens, what I would give to see it, really to see this beautiful, warm, miraculous thing!\nThe weird desire was so strong it brought tears to her eyes, and throbbed within her like ripples nudging against a riverbank. Was her mind finally crumbling?\n\u201cNo,\u201d Irim cried. \u201cGet away, you!\u201d\nThe wysp\u2014it was still here. It was so brilliantly clear in her imagination, and the desire so strong, it seemed larger than she was. Let me see it . . . see it . . .\n\u201cIrim,\u201d she murmured, \u201cDo you feel anything?\u201d\nIrim\u2019s voice tightened. \u201cPelisma, move away!\u201d\nThinking was becoming difficult; moving, impossible. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s too close to you\u2014I can\u2019t shoot it!\u201d\nShe shook her head. \u201cIrim, don\u2019t try. Don\u2019t worry about me. Protect yourself\u2014you\u2019re young, accomplished, and I\u2019m just an old woman who can\u2019t even see a wysp . . . \u201d\nLet me see it . . . see it . . .\nHis voice quivered. \u201cBut I have to save you. You\u2019re the hero of our city.\u201d\nIf only she could wrest the weapon from his hand! \u201cIrim,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cI didn\u2019t save Pelismara with dynamite and explosions. I saved it by creating an outlet. By letting the river flow through.\u201d\nLet me see it, oh please, let me see it . . .\nWait. Flow through? She could feel her control eroding in the flood. If she just let go, would the surge pass by and become manageable? Or would she lose her sanity forever? She wouldn\u2019t surrender without praying for one last bargain.\nO Wanderer, I\u2019m ready to give myself up; only help poor frightened Irim home.\nShe stopped fighting.\nSearing heat stabbed into her head and spread outward in a shock wave of agony. Faintly, she heard herself scream.\nEverything was lost in light.\nPelisma opened her eyes.\nGlory blazed above her. A shinca crown: one perfect crystalline column dividing in two, then in two, then in two again and again, a glowing fractal tree transforming into a cloud of needlepoints against a solid black sky.\nI\u2019m dead.\nBut she could still feel her body. If anything, her blood felt, not cold, but too warm. It hummed, and there was more of it than there should have been, filling her to the brim. Maybe that wasn\u2019t her blood at all.\n\u201cBreathe,\u201d Irim\u2019s voice begged. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me, Pelisma, breathe!\u201d\nShe drew a breath, surprised it had anywhere to enter, with her so full. She couldn\u2019t look away from the perfect clarity of the shinca crown. If she moved, surely this apparition would vanish, shrouded again by the vague shadows of her vision.\nShe whispered, \u201cIrim . . . ?\u201d\n\u201cThank Heile!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWhen that wysp flew through you, I thought you were dead for sure. But it\u2019s gone now.\u201d\n\u201cIt . . . \u201d Her voice sounded normal enough, but words came slowly. \u201cIt flowed through?\u201d The pain was gone, and the strange desire too, but a feeling of presence remained. Had that emotional deluge not been her own at all? Had it been the wysp manipulating her?\nHow delightful!\nBut it wasn\u2019t, it wasn\u2019t! It shouldn\u2019t be possible to feel anything resembling innocent excitement in such circumstances!\nUnless the feeling wasn\u2019t her own.\n\u201cIrim, the wysp flowed in,\u201d Pelisma said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it flowed out again. It\u2019s still here.\u201d\n\u201cHeile have mercy,\u201d Irim said. \u201cHas the spirit spoken to you?\u201d\n\u201cSpoken!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t speak at all!\u201d Icy panic shot down her nerves, but melted inexplicably before it could reach her fingertips. Suddenly she wanted nothing more than to hold someone and apologize. She hugged herself, looked down instinctively\u2014\nAnd saw a glowing golden shape against the black.\nWas this her imagination? It couldn\u2019t be sight\u2014but the shape was that of her own body. Her clothes, her fingernails, even the wrinkles on her knuckles, all lay like a tracery of dark lace over a golden glow within. She held her hands up, considering the folds of her palms for the first time in months, hardly daring to blink. If it wasn\u2019t sight, then what was it?\n\u201cPelisma, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Irim asked.\nShe could hardly speak. \u201cIrim\u2014Irim, I can see. Do wysps see? Well, I suppose they must.\u201d This excitement was real! She looked around.\nIt was not the forest of her memory, glowing with green. It was not the black of night, nor yet the vague mass of shadow usually detected by her failing eyes. The wilderness had changed: now it was rendered in finely detailed layers of transparency, as if built entirely of smoky crystal. It had scents, too, in a strange organization she could scarcely comprehend. Shinca stood out even from great distance, each raising a blazing crystalline crown toward the dark sky, around which wysps swirled in complex patterns. Beneath her feet, soil and rock rippled outward like deep, clear water.\nThis was not a human world. And it was no longer cold, except to Irim. Irim, who was wounded and needed rescue.\n\u201cIrim,\u201d she said, \u201cstay by the tree. I\u2019m going back to the waymarkers.\u201d\n\u201cPelisma, you can\u2019t! That cave-cat\u2019s still out there.\u201d\nHe was right, of course. She searched the strange landscape, but how could she identify a cave-cat in this new sense, among twenty thousand utterly unfamiliar things? \u201cDo you see the cat?\u201d she asked. \u201cCan you show me where it is, so I can figure out what it looks like?\u201d\n\u201cWhat it looks like?\u201d Irim took a deep breath and grasped her hand firmly. \u201cGroundbreaker, it\u2019s my job to protect you. Eyesight like yours does not get cured\u2014certainly not in an instant. We have no idea what that wysp did to you, or why.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not cured,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand that. It\u2019s not exactly seeing, anyway. Irim\u2014\u201d She squeezed his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to tell you this, but the wysp\u2014it\u2019s not human.\u201d\n\u201cIt might be a quiet soul\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Not unless there are folk who see through stone, for whom shinca and wysps are more real than people.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you see?\u201d He was silent a moment. \u201cBut they must be spirits of some kind. Where else would they all come from?\u201d\nWhere else, indeed? She sought for wysps in the shinca crown above her head, and as if she\u2019d called them, several immediately converged on her position.\nIrim gave a hoarse cry and fired his weapon.\nZzap!\nFire exploded from the shadows, a voracious living nightmare screaming alarms down every nerve in her body.\nIt felt like the river pouring in at the gate, faster every second. If she didn\u2019t act, it would consume everything she cared about, every living thing! Pelisma leapt toward the flames, opened her mouth\u2014\nAnd swallowed them.\nEnergy blazed inside her, buzzing to the tips of her fingers and toes, tingling in her lips, and it was full of outrage for those who would put her world at risk. She whirled, looking past the bright silver-gold column of the shinca, and found a fainter light, the imprint of accumulated heat scented with fear and anger. Out of that imprint came a quavering voice.\n\u201cPelisma?\u201d\nPelisma opened her mouth to answer, but the energy within her rose in a sudden, terrifying tide. In an instant, she realized what it meant.\nNo! Not Irim, I mustn\u2019t hurt Irim!\nShe turned, barely in time. White flame poured from her mouth, crackling in the air.\nIrim screamed.\nShe tried to stop, but there was no containing this flood. Horrified, she turned further; the edge of the torrent touched the shinca, and somehow, vanished into it.\nThat\u2019s it.\nShe faced the tree fully, pouring this hate out in the one place where it could do no harm. Anger surged in her heart, but she fought against it.\nNo, you don\u2019t understand! Poor Irim, poor fellow, he didn\u2019t mean it, he doesn\u2019t deserve to die!\nAt last the fire drained away. She fell against the shinca, shivering. Slowly, her horrified exhaustion softened with an incongruous feeling of comfort and regret.\n\u201cIrim?\u201d she asked, trembling. \u201cIn the name of Heile, tell me I haven\u2019t killed you . . . \u201d\n\u201cStay away from me!\u201d\nPelisma fell to her knees. Tears tumbled from her eyes. \u201cIrim, it was an accident, I promise. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\nVoices called across the forest.\nShe raised her head. \u201cHelp!\u201d she shouted. \u201cPlease, help us!\u201d\nThe searchers came. They wrapped her in blankets, brought a stretcher for Irim. She could see its metal struts perfectly; also, the waymarkers and the vehicle that stood waiting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky you found a way to signal us,\u201d the driver rumbled. \u201cOtherwise we might not have found you for hours.\u201d\n\u201cLucky indeed,\u201d agreed the medic. The faint shadows that were her hands moved swiftly and busily over Irim. \u201cThe Wanderer must have been watching over you.\u201d\n\u201cThanks be,\u201d Pelisma agreed, and found Irim echoing her precisely.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be safe underground soon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Pelisma said.\nThey would be safe, wouldn\u2019t they? How could she be sure, when the wysp might control her actions? She touched Irim\u2019s shoulder, and her sick guilt was diluted with another incongruous feeling of tender and sorrowful care.\nShe hadn\u2019t killed him, though. She had to remember that. When the wysp took over, she\u2019d managed to communicate mercy.\nTo communicate.\nA pattern clicked into place, suddenly.\nHer blindness had brought feelings of sorrow and helplessness, but the serious emotional instability had begun with the presence of wysps. Since she\u2019d hidden her feelings from Irim, there would have been no way to link them with the moment of a wysp\u2019s approach\u2014but here in the forest, her feelings had resisted control every time wysps were nearby.\nWhat if these incongruous emotions weren\u2019t weakness, or age, but communication?\nImagine what it could mean to achieve real communication with this thing that was the most capricious, dangerous force in all Varin! A question leapt into her mind, full of unfiltered, helpless anger.\nWhy, wysp? Why did you turn me against my most trusted friend?\nFor an instant she found herself back in that moment, when the fire of Irim\u2019s weapon had mixed with her memory of the Trao thundering in at the gate. The familiar awful conviction rose within her, that if she did not act, her world would be swept away.\nNot her world: their world.\nPerhaps wysps did have souls: souls suited to this wilderness as her own people were to the city-caverns, each just as easily threatened, but with no way to communicate until disaster threw them together.\nOh, praise be!\nWas this joy hers, or did it belong to both of them? Could she ever untangle the wysp\u2019s meanings enough to answer questions about fire, and trees, and food grown beneath the sun\u2014those questions her people so desperately needed to have answered?\nAll at once, she remembered Irim\u2019s voice, reading reverently. Great things may be achieved in the name of love.\n\u201cBlessing of Eyn,\u201d Pelisma breathed. Surely the Wanderer had brought her to these events. Blindness had turned her people\u2019s confinement into her own, changing her heart and bringing the wysps\u2014her people\u2019s threat turned into a personal need. What else could have driven her out into this voyage of discovery? And now her path was clear: she must learn everything possible about the wysps, their vision, and their world.\nThink how she might then change her own.\nJuliette Wade combined a trip to the Gouffre de Padirac with her academic background in linguistics and anthropology to create the world of Varin, a grand experiment in speculative ethnography.

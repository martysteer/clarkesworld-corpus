Sometimes I don\u2019t. It\u2019s no big deal. I do like to make comments on people\u2019s blogs thanking them for their time\u2014they do appreciate it, and I\u2019m prepared to take the bad with the good. I recently found a perverse pleasure in responding to people who auto-Tweet their reviews (good and bad) from Goodreads. I giggle at the mental image of them freaking out (good and bad) because THE AUTHOR IS WATCHING.\n My favorites are the three-star reviews, those bastions of subjectivity! Based on the reader\u2019s experience, three stars can mean that they couldn\u2019t put it down, or that they dropped it in the tub. One of the best wondered, \u201cWas the author tripping on drugs?\u201d But my favorite to date asked, \u201cThree days to fall in love with a frog? How realistic is that?\u201d\n The question references my fairytale novel mash-up that opens with a retelling of \u201cThe Frog Prince\u201d by the Brothers Grimm: A fifteen-year-old introvert writer wanders into a glen and finds a frog who\u2019s actually interested in her work. We find out in the course of the novel that there were magical forces at work that not only orchestrated their meeting but also facilitated their affection but let\u2019s put that aside . . . what fascinates me most about the comment is its willingness to suspend disbelief for the fairy tale world problem but not the actual life experience.\n Has our concept of \u201creality\u201d come so far that we\u2019ve begun to question real life? Or worse, have young people really become so jaded that no one believes in love at first sight anymore?\n Consider the science, both chemical and psychological.\n \n Limerence is defined as an involuntary state of obsessive-compulsive longing for emotional dependence, and is a result of biochemical processes in the brain.\n A \u201clook of love\u201d must last 8.2 seconds, and no less. Love at first glance is the very science behind Speed Dating.\n Attraction happens within the first three minutes of conversation.\n Infatuation\u2014the thing often born from raging hormones and imagined, unrealistic expectations\u2014is a less mature form of limerence, but does not always mean it\u2019s not love.\n \n This love you speak of. It is a thing. People have it. We can PROVE it.\n I fall in love with people all the time. All. The. Time. I mean, yeah, I was once a boy-crazy preteen who had pictures of actors all over her walls and made up all sorts of grand futures for myself and the Boy-of-My-Dreams-At-the-Moment, but I\u2019m talking real love in real life. It doesn\u2019t have to be the romantic kind.\n Mary Robinette Kowal locked her keys in the car while we were introducing ourselves, and I\u2019ve loved her ever since. Casey Cothran and I watched \u201cPoltergeist II\u201d at the same church lock-in. Edmund Schubert and I sat on a bench at a convention and ate granola bars. Catie Murphy and I happened to be taking the same shuttle bus. I was in the front row when John Scalzi crashed my friend\u2019s reading. John Ringo and I shared cheesecake at a publisher dinner. Sammie Bitner bumped me in a busy food court and cried, \u201cOh, my god, I love you!\u201d I yelled back, \u201cOh my god, I love you too!\u201d We\u2019ve been great friends ever since.\n All of these people are friends so close I consider them family. They inspire me. They increase my endorphins and raise my serotonin levels. I love them all\u2014real love\u2014but each instance definitely started with infatuation \u2014 silly, fifteen-year-old-girl-type infatuation.\n So . . . what does it take to make a society disbelieve the idea of infatuation?\n I blame two things: Fear and loss of hope.\n This world we live in is scary. Even scarier than it used to be. Terrorists are real and soldiers go to Afghanistan and angry people with guns shoot up food courts and movie theatres and elementary schools. There are people honestly preparing for the zombie apocalypse. Love, too, is a scary thing. When you open yourself up to the possibility of love, you also open yourself up to a possibility of pain. Once that person gets inside your head they know how to hurt you worse than anyone else. Is it a stretch to imagine that a child who grows up afraid of being hurt physically would similarly be afraid of being hurt emotionally?\n And then there\u2019s hopelessness. In the eighties, popular culture was filled with books and stories of how one man/woman/child could Make a Difference and Save the World! We now live on a planet in the throes of global warming with seven billion other people, and the pop culture icons that save the world only do so with inhuman abilities and catastrophic damage of public property. Legions of apathetic teenagers would much rather sit around and play Call of Duty. Make a difference? But that takes WORK.\n So does love.\n Fascinating, isn\u2019t it, that this random three-star review could open my eyes to the dystopia in which I already appear to be living\u2014a world that might consciously be evolving away from infatuation and love at first sight. I must face the very real possibility that I, and optimists like me, have become a dying breed. Perhaps I should be more careful when proposing silly ideas like cerebral infatuation leading to a healthy relationship and a happily ever after.\n Happily ever after! That\u2019s right! I said that!\n But I\u2019m probably just tripping on drugs.\n Alethea Kontis is a princess, author, fairy godmother, and geek.

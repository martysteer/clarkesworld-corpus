Maintaining the model we\u2019ve used in recent years, the nomination phase took place online and lasted just under two days. The narrow window has proven an effective tool in our efforts to minimize the effects of ballot-stuffing and campaigning. We did observe a slight increase in efforts this year, but even removing those, this year\u2019s poll had our highest participation levels ever.\n This year, it was never apparent which works were destined to become finalists. Everything was in flux right down to the final hours. In the end, ties in the fiction category yielded eight finalists. As in the past, we\u2019ve chosen not to implement a tie-breaker and have passed all eight stories into the final round. We missed having a similar situation happen in the art category by one vote, placed in the final minutes of voting.\n Without further ado, here are this year\u2019s finalists presented in alphabetical order:\n Best Story\n \n \u201cPhilia, Eros, Storge, Ag\u00e1pe, Pragma\u201d by R.S.A. Garcia (Novella, 1/2021)\n \u201cHomecoming is Just Another Word for the Sublimation of the Self\u201d by Isabel J. Kim (Short Story, 3/2021)\n \u201cThe Failed Dianas\u201d by Monique Laban (Short Story, 2/2021)\n \u201cYou Are Born Exploding\u201d by Rich Larson (Novelette, 12/2021)\n \u201cSarcophagus\u201d by Ray Nayler (Novelette, 4/2021)\n \u201cYesterday\u2019s Wolf\u201d by Ray Nayler (Short Story, 9/2021)\n \u201cThe Cold Calculations\u201d by Aimee Ogden (Short Story, 12/2021)\n \u201cBots of the Lost Ark\u201d by Suzanne Palmer (Novelette, 6/2021)\n \n Best Cover Art\n Congratulations to all our finalists!\n Now it\u2019s up to you to pick the winner in each category. Go to:\n And rank the stories by your order of preference. Voting will close on February 15th at 8PM EST and the winners will be announced in our March issue.\n Speaking of awards, Chicon 8\u2014the 80th World Science Fiction Convention\u2014has opened the nomination period for this year\u2019s Hugo Awards. Since there are still a few people who continue to nominate Clarkesworld for Best Semiprozine, I\u2019d like to once again remind you that we haven\u2019t been eligible for that award for a long time. Give your nomination to one of the many fine semiprozines out there instead. You can find a list at semiprozine.org.\n Beyond that, at present, there isn\u2019t a category for professional magazines, but you can always nominate me for Best Editor Short Form if you are so moved, and of course, all our original fiction is eligible in their respective categories. The list of those works and the appropriate category for each story was included in last month\u2019s editorial at clarkesworldmagazine.com/clarke_01_22. Our 2021 cover artists are also eligible in the Best Professional Artist category.\n Speaking from experience, I can tell you that each little nod you give means a lot. Recognition doesn\u2019t pay the bills, but it has value, particularly after the rough couple of years we\u2019ve all had.\n Thank you and happy voting!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

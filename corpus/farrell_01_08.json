Whether this entity arises as an artificial intelligence or through the amplification of our own brains, humanity may be forced to radically alter its way of life just to survive.\n Vernor Vinge, author of the Hugo Award winning novels Rainbows End, A Fire Upon the Deep, and A Deepness in the Sky, has championed this theory since the 1980s, but it was in a presentation to NASA and a subsequent essay in 1993 that he truly fleshed out his understanding of the Singularity and predicted that one should take place between 2005 and 2030.\n \u201cThere are [many] people who inspired this,\u201d Vinge says. \u201cIn science fiction the notion of big changes, including unknowably big changes, has long been a trope. [In the 1960s] there would be stories about super-intelligent critters and the consequences of dealing with super-intelligence. It wasn\u2019t so much about technological progress as it was about aliens. However, together those different things within science fiction meant that many readers, and certainly myself, had the different pieces of this notion of a Singularity\u2014namely technological change in the relatively near future where the most important change would be the rise of super-intelligence and the consequences of that.\u201d\n There are numerous technological developments that might hasten a Singularity, and Vinge thinks that \u201cright now the one that is proceeding like gangbusters is large computer networks and their associated users waking up as a superhumanly intelligent entity.\u201d The 2007 San Diego wildfires and Google\u2019s coverage of the disaster via Google Maps provides an excellent example of these networks. \u201cAn immense amount of information was immediately available there. It really involved all sorts of infrastructure. It involved satellites. It involved robot aircrafts. It involved people on the ground taking pictures. And it involved humans actually interacting with it all to generate more information. In fact, it was so good that, as often is the case, the chief question is: Is it true? You get pictures that are so pretty that [whether] they\u2019re true or not slips into the background.\u201d\n The abundance of \u201csmall, simple devices in the environment\u201d contributes to the increase of human intellect. \u201cI can remember that in the 1960s,\u201d Vinge says, \u201cI very clearly had the notion of Intelligence Amplification\u2014using computer human hookups to achieve greater than human intelligence. But the notion of all sorts of small things in the environment becoming smart, that was something I had not thought about. I can remember how companies wanted to put computers in cameras. I don\u2019t know if that sounds strange anymore, but in 1965 that would be a little bit like saying, \u2018Let\u2019s put a giraffe in a camera.\u2019 There\u2019s a question of size compatibility, but to a science fiction reader that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal because we\u2019re familiar with the notion of miniaturization. But there was also the idea of relevance, and I think if you go back far enough into the 20th Century, the relevance of putting a computer in another application didn\u2019t make any sense because people did not realize how the computer could substitute for the moving parts complexity of the device.\n \u201cThe cell phone on many different levels speaks to trends toward Singularity,\u201d Vinge continues. \u201cThe origin of the term depended on a very large support infrastructure, namely the cell towers and the equipment that was in them. If you go back before that, science fiction [writers] wrote about small wireless telephones, but the notion that [the phones] depended on this immense investment in local radio relays\u2014that I don\u2019t think was there. The idea of having this stuff throughout the environment was not high on the radar screen.\u201d Modern advances in cell phone technology lend it further credence as a precursor to a Singularity. Attachments like Bluetooth move society \u201ctoward this headband technology that science fiction writers from the early 60s on had in mind. That is Intelligence Amplification plus the notion of people being able to cooperate with other people invisibly, and thus becoming a sort of superhuman entity.\u201d\n Despite the proliferation of small computational devices, Vinge thinks that many people, when considering the possible roads to a Singularity, regard the improvement of human intelligence as the most likely course. Vinge imagines a time when \u201cwe start getting prosthetics for parts of the brain, and therefore part of the mind. That\u2019s an intriguing possibility because it would be an interesting response to people who can\u2019t imagine a machine having awareness. What happens when we begin to get grayscale cases\u2014that is, people [with significant portions] of their brains [as] these prosthetics? Right now, actually, I think there are some very small components of the brain that people are talking about being able to repair. There are some central connection points deep in the middle of the brain. If those fail, usually you get a vegetable.\u201d\n Vinge then dovetails off current medical knowledge to engage in what he calls \u201cserious Vernor speculation.\u201d He observes that often coma patients recover \u201cafter an infection that has caused swelling. It raises the possibility in my mind that the trauma that caused the coma had separated things that were supposed to be connected, and the inflammation has brought those areas back in touch with each other. I think it\u2019s not just vast speculation, but people have said more conservative things in the same direction. It\u2019s quite possible that adding small amounts of connectivity could cure some forms of persistent vegetative state. What if artificial vision was able to cure some types of blindness because the neurons in your brain aren\u2019t working right, not because your eyeball isn\u2019t working right?\n \u201cWe may end up in the medical field [with] a creeping cyberization, or a creeping prosthetization, of mental function. This should be a great interest to people who want to debate these issues about artificial intelligence.\u201d\n Though biological science does provide some exciting theorization, in the end Vinge believes biology will fall short because it \u201camounts to a specific solution on a specific substrate, namely the proteins and DNA. That\u2019s one way of running mind. It seems implausible to me that it\u2019s the most efficient way or the fastest way of running mind. If you look at the entire range of physics and the entire range of environments in the universe, it seems we should find one that can support significantly more powerful, computational methods. In the long run (twenty or thirty years) biology loses.\n \u201cOne follow-up that is an interesting optimistic point is that even if biology is not the last word, our form of life has an enormous advantage over the machines. We work in situations where the machines don\u2019t work. If there was some terrible disaster that happened to the machines, obviously humans would suffer enormously, but it\u2019s quite likely that not all humans would die. And the humans are capable of rebuilding the machines. So, if you are one of our hypothetical machine-based super-critters, you might be very happy there are humans around because the humans would form the ultimate backup system.\n \u201cWe have perfect analogies here. As much as some humans may sneer on the biological environment, if all the plants died, you and I would be in deep trouble in a short amount of time. If all the bacteria die, that might be even worse.\u201d\n While the many possible roads to the Singularity are great sources of speculation, the creation of artificial intelligence relies on the existence of powerful computer hardware. Vinge says that \u201craw computer hardware is progressing just fine. Computer hardware trends are moving along embarrassingly and accurately per the trends that were speculated about twenty or thirty years ago. It\u2019s actually kind of eerie. Part of the reason the trends are moving this way is determined by the economic decisions of the manufacturers. They get together and have a roadmap for where we are going to be for the next three or five years, and at least on a timescale of two or three years, they can make good on those. There is an element of self-fulfilling prophecy here.\u201d Vinge references a book entitled Petaflop Computing that discusses \u201cthe possibility that we would achieve [the Singularity] by 2014. I really like the book because [it has] these charts about what [the authors] think is going to happen, when and how it\u2019s going to happen. We are ahead of their prognostications.\n \u201cIf you have those hardware trends, and then if you can estimate the hardware power that we have in our heads, and if you believe that estimate, and if you believe the hardware trends are going to continue (which actually is a type of prediction that may not happen), then that\u2019s a plausibility argument for the Singularity.\u201d But the argument comes up short because we still don\u2019t understand \u201chow to organize the pieces in a way that can support what we think of as thought. Progress in that area I think is proceeding, but if I was going to attack the plausibility of a Singularity as in the essay, that would be the place to attack it.\u201d\n Even though Vinge has spent a large part of his career thinking and writing about the Singularity, he does not believe it is inevitable, though he does consider it the \u201cmost likely out of the non-catastrophic outcomes of the 21st century. I think there are particular forms of the Singularity that can be as scary as anything you want to think about: for instance, a hard takeoff [a Singularity that manifests in a very short time] as the result of a military arms race, or, even worse, a hard takeoff occurring during a war. On the other hand, in its broader form it is something that is very like what humans have always tried to aim for in terms of making things better and understanding the universe. It is quite possible that it could work out in such a way that ordinary humans would end up being participants.\u201d\n It is also possible that the Singularity might happen but human beings would lack the capacity to recognize it. \u201cIt is quite plausible,\u201d Vinge says, \u201cthat roaches do not recognize humans the way we [recognize] gods. Certainly if there were something superhuman, and if it wanted to convince us of its existence, it could do so.\n \u201cIf the Singularity does not happen, and there\u2019s no disaster that kills everybody off, then there probably will be unending arguments about whether it has secretly happened somehow. If that\u2019s how things end up, I certainly hope I would not be a person who\u2019s trying to argue it had happened but we just hadn\u2019t noticed it.\u201d\n Since April 2005, Shaun Farrell has conducted well over seventy author interviews with some of the biggest names in speculative fiction.

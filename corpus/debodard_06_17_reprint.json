To most people, it would be just that: a boring part of a long journey to be avoided\u2014skipped over by Mind-ships as they cut through deep space, passed around at low speeds by Outsider ships while their passengers slept in their hibernation cradles.\n Only if anyone got closer would they see the hulking masses of ships: the glint of starlight on metal, the sharp, pristine beauty of their hulls, even though they all lay quiescent and crippled, forever unable to move\u2014living corpses kept as a reminder of how far they had fallen; the Outsiders\u2019 brash statement of their military might, a reminder that their weapons held the means to fell any Mind-ships they chose to hound.\n On the sensors of The Cinnabar Mansions, the ships all appeared small and diminished, like toy models or avatars\u2014things Lan Nhen could have held in the palm of her hand and just as easily crushed. As the sensors\u2019 line of sight moved\u2014catching ship after ship in their field of view, wreck after wreck, indistinct masses of burned and twisted metal, of ripped-out engines, of shattered life pods and crushed shuttles\u2014Lan Nhen felt as if an icy fist were squeezing her heart into shards. To think of the Minds within\u2014dead or crippled, forever unable to move . . .\n \u201cShe\u2019s not there,\u201d she said, as more and more ships appeared on the screen in front of her, a mass of corpses that all threatened to overwhelm her with sorrow and grief and anger.\n \u201cBe patient, child,\u201d The Cinnabar Mansions said. The Mind\u2019s voice was amused, as it always was\u2014after all, she\u2019d lived for five centuries, and would outlive Lan Nhen and Lan Nhen\u2019s own children by so many years that the pronoun \u201cchild\u201d seemed small and inappropriate to express the vast gulf of generations between them. \u201cWe already knew it was going to take time.\u201d\n \u201cShe was supposed to be on the outskirts of the wards,\u201d Lan Nhen said, biting her lip. She had to be, or the rescue mission was going to be infinitely more complicated. \u201cAccording to Cuc . . . \u201d\n \u201cYour cousin knows what she\u2019s talking about,\u201d The Cinnabar Mansions said.\n \u201cI guess.\u201d Lan Nhen wished Cuc was there with them, and not sleeping in her cabin as peacefully as a baby\u2014but The Cinnabar Mansions had pointed out Cuc needed to be rested for what lay ahead; and Lan Nhen had given in, vastly outranked. Still, Cuc was reliable, for narrow definitions of the term\u2014as long as anything didn\u2019t involve social skills, or deft negotiation. For technical information, though, she didn\u2019t have an equal within the family; and her network of contacts extended deep within Outsider space. That was how they\u2019d found out about the ward in the first place . . .\n \u201cThere.\u201d The sensors beeped, and the view on the screen pulled into enhanced mode on a ship on the edge of the yard which seemed even smaller than the hulking masses of her companions. The Turtle\u2019s Citadel had been from the newer generation of ships, its body more compact and more agile than its predecessors\u2019: designed for flight and maneuvers rather than for transport, more elegant and refined than anything to come out of the Imperial Workshops\u2014unlike the other ships, its prow and hull were decorated, painted with numerous designs from old legends and myths, all the way to the Dai Viet of Old Earth. A single gunshot marred the outside of its hull\u2014a burn mark that had transfixed the painted citadel through one of its towers, going all the way into the heartroom and crippling the Mind that animated the ship.\n \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d Lan Nhen said. \u201cI would know her anywhere.\u201d\n The Cinnabar Mansions had the grace not to say anything, though of course she could have matched the design to her vast databases in an eyeblink. \u201cIt\u2019s time, then. Shall I extrude a pod?\u201d\n Lan Nhen found that her hands had gone slippery with sweat, all of a sudden; and her heart was beating a frantic rhythm within her chest, like temple gongs gone mad. \u201cI guess it\u2019s time, yes.\u201d By any standards, what they were planning was madness. To infiltrate Outsider space, no matter how isolated\u2014to repair a ship, no matter how lightly damaged . . .\n Lan Nhen watched The Turtle\u2019s Citadel for a while\u2014watched the curve of the hull, the graceful tilt of the engines, away from the living quarters; the burn mark through the hull like a gunshot through a human chest. On the prow was a smaller painting, all but invisible unless one had good eyes: a single sprig of apricot flowers, signifying the New Year\u2019s good luck\u2014calligraphied on the ship more than thirty years ago by Lan Nhen\u2019s own mother, a parting gift to her great-aunt before the ship left for her last, doomed mission.\n Of course, Lan Nhen already knew every detail of that shape by heart, every single bend of the corridors within, every little nook and cranny available outside\u2014from the blueprints, and even before that, before the rescue plan had even been the seed of a thought in her mind\u2014when she\u2019d stood before her ancestral altar, watching the rotating holo of a ship who was also her great-aunt, and wondering how a Mind could ever be brought down, or given up for lost.\n Now she was older; old enough to have seen enough things to freeze her blood; old enough to plot her own foolishness, and drag her cousin and her great-great-aunt into it.\n Older, certainly. Wiser, perhaps; if they were blessed enough to survive.\n There were tales, at the Institution, of what they were\u2014and, in any case, one only had to look at them, at their squatter, darker shapes, at the way their eyes crinkled when they laughed. There were other clues, too: the memories that made Catherine wake up breathless and disoriented, staring at the white walls of the dormitory until the pulsing, writhing images of something she couldn\u2019t quite identify had gone, and the breath of dozens of her dorm-mates had lulled her back to sleep. The craving for odd food like fish sauce and fermented meat. The dim, distant feeling of not fitting in, of being compressed on all sides by a society that made little sense to her.\n It should have, though. She\u2019d been taken as a child, like all her schoolmates\u2014saved from the squalor and danger among the savages and brought forward into the light of civilization\u2014of white sterile rooms and bland food, of awkward embraces that always felt too informal. Rescued, Matron always said, her entire face transfigured, the bones of her cheeks made sharply visible through the pallor of her skin. Made safe.\n Catherine had asked what she was safe from. They all did, in the beginning\u2014all the girls in the Institution, Johanna and Catherine being the most vehement amongst them.\n That was until Matron showed them the vid.\n They all sat at their tables, watching the screen in the center of the amphitheater\u2014silent, for once, not jostling or joking among themselves. Even Johanna, who was always first with a biting remark, had said nothing\u2014had sat, transfixed, watching it.\n The first picture was a woman who looked like them\u2014smaller and darker-skinned than the Galactics\u2014except that her belly protruded in front of her, huge and swollen like a tumor from some disaster movie. There was a man next to her, his unfocused eyes suggesting that he was checking something on the network through his implants\u2014until the woman grimaced, putting a hand to her belly and calling out to him. His eyes focused in a heartbeat, and fear replaced the blank expression on his face.\n There was a split second before the language overlays kicked in\u2014a moment, frozen in time, when the words, the sounds of the syllables put together, sounded achingly familiar to Catherine, like a memory of the childhood she never could quite manage to piece together\u2014there was a brief flash, of New Year\u2019s Eve firecrackers going off in a confined space, of her fear that they would burn her, damage her body\u2019s ability to heal . . . And then the moment was gone like a popped bubble, because the vid changed in the most horrific manner.\n The camera was wobbling, rushing along a pulsing corridor\u2014they could all hear the heavy breath of the woman, the whimpering sounds she made like an animal in pain; the soft, encouraging patter of the physician\u2019s words to her.\n \u201cShe\u2019s coming,\u201d the woman whispered, over and over, and the physician nodded\u2014keeping one hand on her shoulder, squeezing it so hard his own knuckles had turned the color of a muddy moon.\n \u201cYou have to be strong,\u201d he said. \u201cHanh, please. Be strong for me. It\u2019s all for the good of the Empire, may it live ten thousand years. Be strong.\u201d\n The vid cut away, then\u2014and it was wobbling more and more crazily, its field of view showing erratic bits of a cramped room with scrolling letters on the wall, the host of other attendants with similar expressions of fear on their faces; the woman, lying on a flat surface, crying out in pain\u2014blood splattering out of her with every thrust of her hips\u2014the camera moving, shifting between her legs, the physician\u2019s hands reaching into the darker opening\u2014easing out a sleek, glinting shape, even as the woman screamed again\u2014and blood, more blood running out, rivers of blood she couldn\u2019t possibly have in her body, even as the thing within her pulled free, and it became all too clear that, though it had the bare shape of a baby with an oversized head, it had too many cables and sharp angles to be human . . .\n Then a quiet fade-to-black, and the same woman being cleaned up by the physician\u2014the thing\u2014the baby being nowhere to be seen. She stared up at the camera; but her gaze was unfocused, and drool was pearling at the corner of her lips, even as her hands spasmed uncontrollably.\n Fade to black again; and the lights came up again, on a room that seemed to have grown infinitely colder.\n \u201cThis,\u201d Matron said in the growing silence, \u201cis how the Dai Viet birth Minds for their spaceships: by incubating them within the wombs of their women. This is the fate that would have been reserved for all of you. For each of you within this room.\u201d Her gaze raked them all, stopping longer than usual on Catherine and Johanna, the known troublemakers in the class. \u201cThis is why we had to take you away, so that you wouldn\u2019t become broodmares for abominations.\u201d\n \u201cWe,\u201d of course, meant the Board\u2014the religious nuts, as Johanna liked to call them, a redemptionist church with a fortune to throw around, financing the children\u2019s rescues and their education\u2014and who thought every life from humans to insects was sacred (they\u2019d all wondered, of course, where they fitted into the scheme).\n After the class had dispersed like a flock of sparrows, Johanna held court in the yard, her eyes bright and feverish. \u201cThey faked it. They had to. They came up with some stupid explanation on how to keep us cooped here. I mean, why would anyone still use natural births and not artificial wombs?\u201d\n Catherine, still seeing the splatters of blood on the floor, shivered. \u201cMatron said that they wouldn\u2019t. That they thought the birth created a special bond between the Mind and its mother\u2014but that they had to be there, to be awake during the birth.\u201d\n \u201cRubbish.\u201d Johanna shook her head. \u201cAs if that\u2019s even remotely plausible. I\u2019m telling you, it has to be fake.\u201d\n \u201cIt looked real.\u201d Catherine remembered the woman\u2019s screams; the wet sound as the Mind wriggled free from her womb; the fear in the face of all the physicians. \u201cArtificial vids aren\u2019t this . . . messy.\u201d They\u2019d seen the artificial vids: slick, smooth things where the actors were tall and muscular, the actresses pretty and graceful, with only a thin veneer of artificially generated defects to make the entire thing believable. They\u2019d learned to tell them apart from the rest; because it was a survival skill in the Institution, to sort out the lies from the truth.\n \u201cI bet they can fake that, too,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cThey can fake everything if they feel like it.\u201d But her face belied her words; even she had been shocked. Even she didn\u2019t believe they would have gone that far.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lie,\u201d Catherine said, finally. \u201cNot this time.\u201d\n And she didn\u2019t need to look at the other girls\u2019 faces to know that they believed the same thing as her\u2014even Johanna, for all her belligerence\u2014and to feel in her gut that this changed everything.\n Cuc came online when the shuttle pod launched from The Cinnabar Mansions\u2014in the heart-wrenching moment when the gravity of the ship fell away from Lan Nhen, and the cozy darkness of the pod\u2019s cradle was replaced with the distant forms of the derelict ships. \u201cHey, cousin. Missed me?\u201d Cuc asked.\n \u201cAs much as I missed a raging fire.\u201d Lan Nhen checked her equipment a last time\u2014the pod was basic and functional, with barely enough space for her to squeeze into the cockpit, and she\u2019d had to stash her various cables and terminals into the nooks and crannies of a structure that hadn\u2019t been meant for more than emergency evacuation. She could have asked The Cinnabar Mansions for a regular transport shuttle, but the pod was smaller and more controllable; and it stood more chances of evading the derelict ward\u2019s defenses.\n \u201cHahaha,\u201d Cuc said, though she didn\u2019t sound amused. \u201cThe family found out what we were doing, by the way.\u201d\n \u201cAnd?\u201d It would have devastated Lan Nhen, a few years ago; now she didn\u2019t much care. She knew she was doing the right thing. No filial daughter would let a member of the family rust away in a foreign cemetery\u2014if she couldn\u2019t rescue her great-aunt, she\u2019d at least bring the body back for a proper funeral.\n \u201cThey think we\u2019re following one of Great-great-aunt\u2019s crazy plans.\u201d\n \u201cHa,\u201d Lan Nhen snorted. Her hands were dancing on the controls, plotting a trajectory that would get her to The Turtle\u2019s Citadel while leaving her the maximum thrust reserve in case of unexpected maneuvers.\n \u201cI\u2019m not the one coming up with crazy plans,\u201d The Cinnabar Mansions pointed out on the comms channel, distractedly. \u201cI leave that to the young. Hang on\u2014\u201d she dropped out of sight. \u201cI have incoming drones, child.\u201d\n Of course. It was unlikely the Outsiders would leave their precious war trophies unprotected. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n A translucent overlay gradually fell over her field of vision through the pod\u2019s windshield; and points lit up all over its surface\u2014a host of fast-moving, small crafts with contextual arrows showing basic kinematics information as well as projected trajectory cones. Lan Nhen repressed a curse. \u201cThat many? They really like their wrecked spaceships, don\u2019t they.\u201d\n It wasn\u2019t a question, and neither Cuc nor The Cinnabar Mansions bothered to answer. \u201cThey\u2019re defense drones patrolling the perimeter. We\u2019ll walk you through,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cGive me just a few moments to link up with Great-great-aunt\u2019s systems . . . \u201d\n Lan Nhen could imagine her cousin, lying half-prone on her bed in the lower decks of The Cinnabar Mansions, her face furrowed in that half-puzzled, half-focused expression that was typical of her thought processes\u2014she\u2019d remain that way for entire minutes, or as long as it took to find a solution. On her windshield, the squad of drones was spreading\u2014coming straight at her from all directions, a dazzling ballet of movement meant to overwhelm her. And they would, if she didn\u2019t move fast enough.\n Her fingers hovered over the pod\u2019s controls, before she made her decision and launched into a barrel maneuver away from the nearest incoming cluster. \u201cCousin, how about hurrying up?\u201d\n There was no answer from Cuc. Demons take her, this wasn\u2019t the moment to overthink the problem! Lan Nhen banked sharply, narrowly avoiding a squad of drones, who bypassed her\u2014and then turned around, much quicker than she\u2019d anticipated. Ancestors, they moved fast, much too fast for ion-thrust motors. Cuc was going to have to rethink her trajectory. \u201cCousin, did you see this?\u201d\n \u201cI saw.\u201d Cuc\u2019s voice was distant. \u201cAlready taken into account. Given the size of the craft, it was likely they were going to use helicoidal thrusters on those.\u201d\n \u201cThis is all fascinating\u2014\u201d Lan Nhen wove her way through two more waves of drones, cursing wildly as shots made the pod rock around her\u2014as long as her speed held, she\u2019d be fine . . . She\u2019d be fine . . . \u201c\u2014but you\u2019ll have noticed I don\u2019t really much care about technology, especially not now!\u201d\n A thin thread of red appeared on her screen\u2014a trajectory that wove and banked like a frightened fish\u2019s trail\u2014all the way to The Turtle\u2019s Citadel and its clusters of pod-cradles. It looked as though it was headed straight into the heart of the cloud of drones, though that wasn\u2019t the most worrying aspect of it. \u201cCousin,\u201d Lan Nhen said. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly do this\u2014\u201d The margin of error was null\u2014if she slipped in one of the curves, she\u2019d never regain the kinematics necessary to take the next.\n \u201cOnly way.\u201d Cuc\u2019s voice was emotionless. \u201cI\u2019ll update as we go, if Great-great-aunt sees an opening. But for the moment . . . \u201d\n Lan Nhen closed her eyes, for a brief moment\u2014turned them towards Heaven, though Heaven was all around her\u2014and whispered a prayer to her ancestors, begging them to watch over her. Then she turned her gaze to the screen, and launched into flight\u2014her hands flying and shifting over the controls, automatically adjusting the pod\u2019s path\u2014dancing into the heart of the drones\u2019 swarm\u2014into them, away from them, weaving an erratic path across the section of space that separated her from The Turtle\u2019s Citadel. Her eyes, all the while, remained on the overlay\u2014her fingers speeding across the controls, matching the slightest deviation of her course to the set trajectory\u2014inflecting curves a fraction of a second before the error on her course became perceptible.\n \u201cAlmost there,\u201d Cuc said\u2014with a hint of encouragement in her voice. \u201cCome on, cousin, you can do it\u2014\u201d\n Ahead of her, a few measures away, was The Turtle\u2019s Citadel: its pod cradles had shriveled from long atrophy, but the hangar for docking the external shuttles and pods remained, its entrance a thin line of gray across the metallic surface of the ship\u2019s lower half.\n \u201cIt\u2019s closed,\u201d Lan Nhen said, breathing hard\u2014she was coming fast, much too fast, scattering drones out of her way like scared mice, and if the hangar wasn\u2019t opened . . . \u201cCousin!\u201d\n Cuc\u2019s voice seemed to come from very far away; distant and muted somehow on the comms system. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this. Normally, the ship went into emergency standby when it was hit, and it should open\u2014\u201d\n \u201cBut what if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d Lan Nhen asked\u2014the ship was looming over her, spreading to cover her entire windshield, close enough so she could count the pod cradles, could see their pockmarked surfaces\u2014could imagine how much of a messy impact she\u2019d make, if her own pod crashed on an unyielding surface.\n Cuc didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t need to; they both knew what would happen if that turned out to be true. Ancestors, watch over me, Lan Nhen thought, over and over, as the hangar doors rushed towards her, still closed\u2014ancestors watch over me . . .\n She was close enough to see the fine layers of engravings on the doors when they opened\u2014the expanse of metal flowing away from the center, to reveal a gaping hole just large enough to let a small craft through. Her own pod squeezed into the available space: darkness fell over her cockpit as the doors flowed shut, and the pod skidded to a halt, jerking her body like a disarticulated doll.\n It was a while before she could stop shaking for long enough to unstrap herself from the pod; and to take her first, tentative steps on the ship.\n The small lamp in her suit lit nothing but a vast, roiling mass of shadows: the hangar was huge enough to hold much larger ships. Thirty years ago, it had no doubt been full, but the Outsiders must have removed them all as they dragged the wreck out there.\n \u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d she whispered; and set out through the darkness, to find the heartroom and the Mind that was her great-aunt.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jason said to Catherine. \u201cYour first choice of posting was declined by the Board.\u201d\n Catherine sat very straight in her chair, trying to ignore how uncomfortable she felt in her suit\u2014it gaped too large over her chest, flared too much at her hips, and she\u2019d had to hastily readjust the trouser-legs after she and Johanna discovered the seamstress had got the length wrong. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, because there was nothing else she could say, really.\n Jason looked at his desk, his gaze boring into the metal as if he could summon an assignment out of nothing\u2014she knew he meant well, that he had probably volunteered to tell her this himself, instead of leaving it for some stranger who wouldn\u2019t care a jot for her\u2014but in that moment, she didn\u2019t want to be reminded that he worked for the Board for the Protection of Dai Viet Refugees; that he\u2019d had a hand, no matter how small, in denying her wishes for the future.\n At length Jason said, slowly, carefully, reciting a speech he\u2019d no doubt given a dozen times that day, \u201cThe government puts the greatest care into choosing postings for the refugees. It was felt that that putting you on board a space station would be\u2014unproductive.\u201d\n Unproductive. Catherine kept smiling; kept her mask plastered on, even though it hurt to turn the corners of her mouth upwards, to crinkle her eyes as if she were pleased. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, again, knowing anything else was useless. \u201cThanks, Jason.\u201d\n Jason colored. \u201cI tried arguing your case, but . . . \u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Catherine said. He was a clerk; that was all; a young civil servant at the bottom of the Board\u2019s hierarchy, and he couldn\u2019t possibly get her what she wanted, even if he\u2019d been willing to favor her. And it hadn\u2019t been such a surprise, anyway. After Mary and Olivia and Johanna . . .\n \u201cLook,\u201d Jason said. \u201cLet\u2019s see each other tonight, right? I\u2019ll take you someplace you can forget all about this.\u201d\n \u201cYou know it\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Catherine said. As if a restaurant, or a wild waterfall ride, or whatever delight Jason had in mind could make her forget this.\n \u201cNo, but I can\u2019t do anything about the Board.\u201d Jason\u2019s voice was firm. \u201cI can, however, make sure that you have a good time tonight.\u201d\n Catherine forced a smile she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind. Thanks.\u201d\n As she exited the building, passing under the wide arches, the sun sparkled on the glass windows\u2014and for a brief moment she wasn\u2019t herself\u2014she was staring at starlight reflected in a glass panel, watching an older woman running hands on a wall and smiling at her with gut-wrenching sadness . . . She blinked, and the moment was gone; though the sense of sadness, of unease remained, as if she were missing something essential.\n Johanna was waiting for her on the steps, her arms crossed in front of her, and a gaze that looked as though it would bore holes into the lawn.\n \u201cWhat did they tell you?\u201d\n Catherine shrugged, wondering how a simple gesture could cost so much. \u201cThe same they told you, I\u2019d imagine. Unproductive.\u201d\n They\u2019d all applied to the same postings\u2014all asked for something related to space, whether it was one of the observatories, a space station; or, in Johanna\u2019s case, outright asking to board a slow-ship as crew. They\u2019d all been denied, for variations of the same reason.\n \u201cWhat did you get?\u201d Johanna asked. Her own rumpled slip of paper had already been recycled at the nearest terminal; she was heading north, to Steele, where she\u2019d join an archaeological dig.\n Catherine shrugged, with a casualness she didn\u2019t feel. They\u2019d always felt at ease under the stars\u2014had always yearned to take to space, felt the same craving to be closer to their home planets\u2014to hang, weightless and without ties, in a place where they wouldn\u2019t be weighed, wouldn\u2019t be judged for falling short of values that ultimately didn\u2019t belong to them. \u201cI got newswriter.\u201d\n \u201cAt least you\u2019re not moving very far, \u201d Johanna said, a tad resentfully.\n \u201cNo.\u201d The offices of the network company were a mere two streets away from the Institution.\n \u201cI bet Jason had a hand in your posting,\u201d Johanna said.\n \u201cHe didn\u2019t say anything about that\u2014\u201d\n \u201cOf course he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Johanna snorted, gently. She didn\u2019t much care for Jason; but she knew how much his company meant to Catherine\u2014how much more it would come to mean, if the weight of an entire continent separated Catherine and her. \u201cJason broadcasts his failures because they bother him; you\u2019ll hardly ever hear him talk of his successes. He\u2019d feel too much like he was boasting.\u201d Her face changed, softened. \u201cHe cares for you, you know\u2014truly. You have the best luck in the world.\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Catherine said\u2014thinking of the touch of his lips on hers; of his arms, holding her close until she felt whole, fulfilled. \u201cI know.\u201d\n The best luck in the world\u2014she and Jason and her new flat, and her old haunts, not far away from the Institution\u2014though she wasn\u2019t sure, really, if that last was a blessing\u2014if she wanted to remember the years Matron had spent hammering proper behavior into them: the deprivations whenever they spoke anything less than perfect Galactic, the hours spent cleaning the dormitory\u2019s toilets for expressing mild revulsion at the food; or the night they\u2019d spent shut outside, naked, in the growing cold, because they couldn\u2019t remember which Galactic president had colonized Longevity Station\u2014how Matron had found them all huddled against each other, in an effort to keep warm and awake, and had sent them to Discipline for a further five hours, scolding them for behaving like wild animals.\n Catherine dug her nails into the palms of her hands\u2014letting the pain anchor her back to the present; to where she sat on the steps of the Board\u2019s central offices, away from the Institution and all it meant to them.\n \u201cWe\u2019re free,\u201d she said, at last. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019ll never be free.\u201d Johanna\u2019s tone was dark, intense. \u201cYour records have a mark that says \u2018Institution\u2019. And even if it didn\u2019t\u2014do you honestly believe we would blend right in?\u201d\n There was no one quite like them on Prime, where Dai Viet were unwelcome; not with those eyes, not with that skin color\u2014not with that demeanor, which even years of Institution hadn\u2019t been enough to erase.\n \u201cDo you ever wonder . . . \u201d Johanna\u2019s voice trailed off into silence, as if she were contemplating something too large to put into words.\n \u201cWonder what?\u201d Catherine asked.\n Johanna bit her lip. \u201cDo you ever wonder what it would have been like, with our parents? Our real parents.\u201d\n The parents they couldn\u2019t remember. They\u2019d done the math, too\u2014no children at the Institution could remember anything before coming there. Matron had said it was because they were really young when they were taken away\u2014that it had been for the best. Johanna, of course, had blamed something more sinister, some fix-up done by the Institution to its wards to keep them docile.\n Catherine thought, for a moment, of a life among the Dai Viet\u2014an idyllic image of a harmonious family like in the holo-movies\u2014a mirage that dashed itself to pieces against the inescapable reality of the birth vid. \u201cThey\u2019d have used us like broodmares,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cYou saw\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know what I saw,\u201d Johanna snapped. \u201cBut maybe . . . \u201d Her face was pale. \u201cMaybe it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, in return for the rest.\u201d\n For being loved; for being made worthy; for fitting in, being able to stare at the stars without wondering which was their home\u2014without dreaming of when they might go back to their families.\n Catherine rubbed her belly, thinking of the vid\u2014and the thing crawling out of the woman\u2019s belly, all metal edges and shining crystal, coated in the blood of its mother\u2014and, for a moment she felt as though she were the woman\u2014floating above her body, detached from her cloak of flesh, watching herself give birth in pain. And then the sensation ended, but she was still feeling spread out, larger than she ought to have been\u2014looking at herself from a distance and watching her own life pass her by, petty and meaningless, and utterly bounded from end to end.\n Maybe Johanna was right. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad, after all.\n The ship was smaller than Lan Nhen had expected\u2014she\u2019d been going by her experience with The Cinnabar Mansions, which was an older generation, but The Turtle\u2019s Citadel was much smaller for the same functionalities.\n Lan Nhen went up from the hangar to the living quarters, her equipment slung over her shoulders. She\u2019d expected a sophisticated defense system like the drones, but there was nothing. Just the familiar slimy feeling of a quickened ship on the walls, a sign that the Mind that it hosted was still alive\u2014albeit barely. The walls were bare, instead of the elaborate decoration Lan Nhen was used to from The Cinnabar Mansions\u2014no scrolling calligraphy, no flowing paintings of starscapes or flowers; no ambient sound of zither or anything to enliven the silence.\n She didn\u2019t have much time to waste\u2014Cuc had said they had two hours between the moment the perimeter defenses kicked in and the moment more hefty safeguards were manually activated\u2014but she couldn\u2019t help herself: she looked into one of the living quarters. It was empty as well, its walls scored with gunfire. The only color in the room was a few splatters of dried blood on a chair, a reminder of the tragedy of the ship\u2019s fall\u2014the execution of its occupants, the dragging of its wreck to the derelict ward\u2014dried blood, and a single holo of a woman on a table, a beloved mother or grandmother: a bare, abandoned picture with no offerings or incense, all that remained from a wrecked ancestral altar. Lan Nhen spat on the ground, to ward off evil ghosts, and went back to the corridors.\n She truly felt as though she were within a mausoleum\u2014like that one time her elder sister had dared her and Cuc to spend the night within the family\u2019s ancestral shrine, and they\u2019d barely slept\u2014not because of monsters or anything, but because of the vast silence that permeated the whole place amidst the smell of incense and funeral offerings, reminding them that they, too, were mortal.\n That Minds, too, could die\u2014that rescues were useless\u2014no, she couldn\u2019t afford to think like that. She had Cuc with her, and together they would . . .\n She hadn\u2019t heard Cuc for a while.\n She stopped, when she realized\u2014that it wasn\u2019t only the silence on the ship, but also the deathly quiet of her own comms system. Since\u2014since she\u2019d entered The Turtle\u2019s Citadel\u2014that was the last time she\u2019d heard her cousin, calmly pointing out emergency standby and hangar doors and how everything was going to work out, in the end . . .\n She checked her comms. There appeared to be nothing wrong; but whichever frequency she selected, she could hear nothing but static. At last, she managed to find one slot that seemed less crowded than others. \u201cCousin? Can you hear me?\u201d\n Noise on the line. \u201cVery\u2014badly.\u201d Cuc\u2019s voice was barely recognizable. \u201cThere\u2014is\u2014something\u2014interference\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI know,\u201d Lan Nhen said. \u201cEvery channel is filled with noise.\u201d\n Cuc didn\u2019t answer for a while; and when she did, her voice seemed to have become more distant\u2014a problem had her interest again. \u201cNot\u2014noise. They\u2019re broadcasting\u2014data. Need\u2014to . . . \u201d And then the comms cut. Lan Nhen tried all frequencies, trying to find one that would be less noisy; but there was nothing. She bit down a curse\u2014she had no doubt Cuc would find a way around whatever blockage the Outsiders had put on the ship, but this was downright bizarre. Why broadcast data? Cutting down the comms of prospective attackers somehow didn\u2019t seem significant enough\u2014at least not compared to defense drones or similar mechanisms.\n She walked through the corridors, following the spiral path to the heartroom\u2014nothing but the static in her ears, a throbbing song that erased every coherent thought from her mind\u2014at least it was better than the silence, than that feeling of moving underwater in an abandoned city\u2014that feeling that she was too late, that her great-aunt was already dead and past recovery, that all she could do here was kill her once and for all, end her misery . . .\n She thought, incongruously, of a vid she\u2019d seen, which showed her great-grandmother ensconced in the heartroom\u2014in the first few years of The Turtle\u2019s Citadel\u2019s life, those crucial moments of childhood when the ship\u2019s mother remained on board to guide the Mind to adulthood. Great-grandmother was telling stories to the ship\u2014and The Turtle\u2019s Citadel was struggling to mimic the spoken words in scrolling texts on her walls, laughing delightedly whenever she succeeded\u2014all sweet and young, unaware of what her existence would come to, in the end.\n Unlike the rest of the ship, the heartroom was crowded\u2014packed with Outsider equipment that crawled over the Mind\u2019s resting place in the center, covering her from end to end until Lan Nhen could barely see the glint of metal underneath. She gave the entire contraption a wide berth\u2014the spikes and protrusions from the original ship poked at odd angles, glistening with a dark liquid she couldn\u2019t quite identify\u2014and the Outsider equipment piled atop the Mind, a mass of cables and unfamiliar machines, looked as though it was going to take a while to sort out.\n There were screens all around, showing dozens of graphs and diagrams, shifting as they tracked variables that Lan Nhen couldn\u2019t guess at\u2014vital signs, it looked like, though she wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell what.\n Lan Nhen bowed in the direction of the Mind, from younger to elder\u2014perfunctorily, since she was unsure whether the Mind could see her at all. There was no acknowledgement, either verbal or otherwise.\n Her great-aunt was in there. She had to be.\n \u201cCousin.\u201d Cuc\u2019s voice was back in her ears\u2014crisp and clear and uncommonly worried.\n \u201cHow come I can hear you?\u201d Lan Nhen asked. \u201cBecause I\u2019m in the heartroom?\u201d\n Cuc snorted. \u201cHardly. The heartroom is where all the data is streaming from. I\u2019ve merely found a way to filter the transmissions on both ends. Fascinating problem . . . \u201d\n \u201cIs this really the moment?\u201d Lan Nhen asked. \u201cI need you to walk me through the reanimation\u2014\u201d\n \u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cFirst you need to hear what I have to say.\u201d\n The call came during the night: a man in the uniform of the Board asked for Catherine George\u2014as if he couldn\u2019t tell that it was her, that she was standing disheveled and pale in front of her screen at three in the morning. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me,\u201d Catherine said. She fought off the weight of nightmares\u2014more and more, she was waking in the night with memories of blood splattered across her entire body; of stars collapsing while she watched, powerless\u2014of a crunch, and a moment where she hung alone in darkness, knowing that she had been struck a death blow\u2014\n The man\u2019s voice was quiet, emotionless. There had been an accident in Steele; a regrettable occurrence that hadn\u2019t been meant to happen, and the Board would have liked to extend its condolences to her\u2014they apologized for calling so late, but they thought she should know . . .\n \u201cI see,\u201d Catherine said. She kept herself uncomfortably straight\u2014aware of the last time she\u2019d faced the board\u2014when Jason had told her her desire for space would have been unproductive. When they\u2019d told Johanna . . .\n Johanna.\n After a while, the man\u2019s words slid past her like water on glass\u2014hollow reassurances, empty condolences, whereas she stood as if her heart had been torn away from her, fighting a desire to weep, to retch\u2014she wanted to turn back time, to go back to the previous week and the sprigs of apricot flowers Jason had given her with a shy smile\u2014to breathe in the sharp, tangy flavor of the lemon cake he\u2019d baked for her, see again the carefully blank expression on his face as he waited to see if she\u2019d like it\u2014she wanted to be held tight in his arms and told that it was fine, that everything was going to be fine, that Johanna was going to be fine.\n \u201cWe\u2019re calling her other friends,\u201d the man was saying, \u201cbut since you were close to each other . . . \u201d\n \u201cI see,\u201d Catherine said\u2014of course he didn\u2019t understand the irony, that it was the answer she\u2019d given the Board\u2014Jason\u2014the last time.\n The man cut off the communication; and she was left alone, standing in her living room and fighting back the feeling that threatened to overwhelm her\u2014a not-entirely unfamiliar sensation of dislocation in her belly, the awareness that she didn\u2019t belong here among the Galactics; that she wasn\u2019t there by choice, and couldn\u2019t leave; that her own life should have been larger, more fulfilling than this slow death by inches, writing copy for feeds without any acknowledgement of her contributions\u2014that Johanna\u2019s life should have been larger . . .\n Her screen was still blinking\u2014an earlier message from the Board that she hadn\u2019t seen? But why\u2014\n Her hands, fumbling away in the darkness, made the command to retrieve the message\u2014the screen faded briefly to black while the message was decompressed, and then she was staring at Johanna\u2019s face.\n For a moment\u2014a timeless, painful moment\u2014Catherine thought with relief that it had been a mistake, that Johanna was alive after all; and then she realized how foolish she\u2019d been\u2014that it wasn\u2019t a call, but merely a message from beyond the grave.\n Johanna\u2019s face was pale, so pale Catherine wanted to hug her, to tell her the old lie that things were going to be fine\u2014but she\u2019d never get to say those words now, not ever.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Catherine,\u201d she said. Her voice was shaking; and the circles under her eyes took up half of her face, turning her into some pale nightmare from horror movies\u2014a ghost, a restless soul, a ghoul hungry for human flesh. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, not anymore. The Institution was fine; but it\u2019s got worse. I wake up at night, and feel sick\u2014as if everything good has been leached from the world\u2014as if the food had no taste, as if I drifted like a ghost through my days, as if my entire life held no meaning or truth. Whatever they did to our memories in the Institution\u2014it\u2019s breaking down now. It\u2019s tearing me apart. I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t take any more of this. I\u2014\u201d she looked away from the camera for a brief moment, and then back at Catherine. \u201cI have to go.\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Catherine whispered, but she couldn\u2019t change it. She couldn\u2019t do anything.\n \u201cYou were always the strongest of us,\u201d Johanna said. \u201cPlease remember this. Please. Catherine.\u201d And then the camera cut, and silence spread through the room, heavy and unbearable, and Catherine felt like weeping, though she had no tears left.\n \u201cCatherine?\u201d Jason called in a sleepy voice from the bedroom. \u201cIt\u2019s too early to check your work inbox . . . \u201d\n Work. Love. Meaningless, Johanna had said. Catherine walked to the huge window pane, and stared at the city spread out below her\u2014the mighty Prime, center of the Galactic Federation, its buildings shrouded in light, its streets crisscrossed by floaters; with the bulky shape of the Parliament at the center, a proud statement that the Galactic Federation still controlled most of their home galaxy.\n Too many lights to see the stars; but she could still guess; could still feel their pull\u2014could still remember that one of them was her home.\n A lie, Johanna had said. A construction to keep us here.\n \u201cCatherine?\u201d Jason stood behind her, one hand wrapped around her shoulder\u2014awkwardly tender as always, like that day when he\u2019d offered to share a flat, standing balanced on one foot and not looking at her.\n \u201cJohanna is dead. She killed herself.\u201d\n She felt rather than saw him freeze\u2014and, after a while, he said in a changed voice, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know how much she meant . . . \u201d His voice trailed off, and he too, fell silent, watching the city underneath.\n There was a feeling\u2014the same feeling she\u2019d had when waking up as a child, a diffuse sense that something was not quite right with the world; that the shadows held men watching, waiting for the best time to snatch her; that she was not wholly back in her body\u2014that Jason\u2019s hand on her shoulder was just the touch of a ghost, that even his love wasn\u2019t enough to keep her safe. That the world was fracturing around her, time and time again\u2014she breathed in, hoping to dispel the sensation. Surely it was nothing more than grief, than fatigue\u2014but the sensation wouldn\u2019t go away, leaving her on the verge of nausea.\n \u201cYou should have killed us,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cIt would have been kinder.\u201d\n \u201cKilled you?\u201d Jason sounded genuinely shocked.\n \u201cWhen you took us from our parents.\u201d\n Jason was silent for a while. Then: \u201cWe don\u2019t kill. What do you think we are, monsters from the fairytales, killing and burning everyone who looks different? Of course we\u2019re not like that.\u201d Jason no longer sounded uncertain or awkward; it was as if she\u2019d touched some wellspring, scratched some skin to find only primal reflexes underneath.\n \u201cYou erased our memories.\u201d She didn\u2019t make any effort to keep the bitterness from her voice.\n \u201cWe had to.\u201d Jason shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019d have killed you, otherwise. You know this.\u201d\n \u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d Look at Johanna, she wanted to say. Look at me. How can you say it was all worth it?\n \u201cCatherine . . . \u201d Jason\u2019s voice was weary. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this before. You\u2019ve seen the vids from the early days. We didn\u2019t set out to steal your childhood, or anyone\u2019s childhood. But when you were left\u2014intact . . . accidents happened. Carelessness. Like Johanna.\u201d\n \u201cLike Johanna.\u201d Her voice was shaking now; but he didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t do anything to comfort her or hold her close. She turned at last, to stare into his face; and saw him transfixed by light, by faith, his gaze turned away from her and every pore of his being permeated by the utter conviction that he was right, that they were all right and that a stolen childhood was a small price to pay to be a Galactic.\n \u201cAnything would do.\u201d Jason\u2019s voice was slow, quiet\u2014explaining life to a child, a script they\u2019d gone over and over in their years together, always coming back to the same enormous, inexcusable choice that had been made for them. \u201cScissors, knives, broken bottles. You sliced your veins, hanged yourselves, pumped yourselves full of drugs . . . We had to . . . we had to block your memories, to make you blank slates.\u201d\n \u201cHad to.\u201d She was shaking now; and still he didn\u2019t see. Still she couldn\u2019t make him see.\n \u201cI swear to you, Catherine. It was the only way.\u201d\n And she knew, she\u2019d always known he was telling the truth\u2014not because he was right, but because he genuinely could not envision any other future for them.\n \u201cI see,\u201d she said. The nausea, the sense of dislocation, wouldn\u2019t leave her\u2014disgust for him, for this life that trapped her, for everything she\u2019d turned into or been turned into. \u201cI see.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think I like it?\u201d His voice was bitter. \u201cDo you think it makes me sleep better at night? Every day I hate that choice, even though I wasn\u2019t the one who made it. Every day I wonder if there was something else the Board could have done, some other solution that wouldn\u2019t have robbed you of everything you were.\u201d\n \u201cNot everything,\u201d Catherine said\u2014slowly, carefully. \u201cWe still look Dai Viet.\u201d\n Jason grimaced, looking ill at ease. \u201cThat\u2019s your body, Catherine. Of course they weren\u2019t going to steal that.\u201d\n Of course; and suddenly, seeing how uneasy he was, it occurred to Catherine that they could have changed that, too, just as easily as they\u2019d tampered with her memories; made her skin clearer, her eyes less distinctive; could have helped her fit into Galactic society. But they hadn\u2019t. Holding the strings to the last, Johanna would have said. \u201cYou draw the line at my body, but stealing my memories is fine?\u201d\n Jason sighed; he turned towards the window, looking at the streets. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not, and I\u2019m sorry. But how else were we supposed to keep you alive?\u201d\n \u201cPerhaps we didn\u2019t want to be alive.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t say that, please.\u201d His voice had changed, had become fearful, protective. \u201cCatherine. Everyone deserves to live. You especially.\u201d\n Perhaps I don\u2019t, she thought, but he was holding her close to him, not letting her go\u2014her anchor to the flat\u2014to the living room, to life. \u201cYou\u2019re not Johanna,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n The strongest of us, Johanna had said. She didn\u2019t feel strong; just frail and adrift. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, at last. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not.\u201d\n \u201cCome on,\u201d Jason said. \u201cLet me make you a tisane. We\u2019ll talk in the kitchen\u2014you look as though you need it.\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d And she looked up\u2014sought out his lips in the darkness, drinking in his breath and his warmth to fill the emptiness within her. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I need.\u201d\n \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Jason looked uncertain\u2014sweet and innocent and na\u00efve, everything that had drawn her to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not in a state to\u2014\u201d\n \u201cSsh,\u201d she said, and laid a hand on his lips, where she\u2019d kissed him. \u201cSsh.\u201d\n Later, after they\u2019d made love, she lay her head in the hollow of his arm, listening to the slow beat of his heart like a lifeline; and wondered how long she\u2019d be able to keep the emptiness at bay.\n \u201cIt goes to Prime,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cAll the data is beamed to Prime, and it\u2019s coming from almost every ship in the ward.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lan Nhen said. She\u2019d plugged her own equipment into the ship, carefully shifting the terminals she couldn\u2019t make sense of\u2014hadn\u2019t dared to go closer to the center, where Outsider technology had crawled all over her great-aunt\u2019s resting place, obscuring the Mind and the mass of connectors that linked her to the ship.\n On one of the screens, a screensaver had launched: night on a planet Lan Nhen couldn\u2019t recognize\u2014an Outsider one, with their sleek floaters and their swarms of helper bots, their wide, impersonal streets planted with trees that were too tall and too perfect to be anything but the product of years of breeding.\n \u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d Cuc said.\n \u201cI\u2014\u201d Lan Nhen was about to say she didn\u2019t understand, and then the true import of Cuc\u2019s words hit her. \u201cNot here? She\u2019s alive, Cuc. I can see the ship; I can hear her all around me . . . \u201d\n \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Cuc said, a tad impatiently. \u201cBut that\u2019s . . . the equivalent of unconscious processes, like breathing in your sleep.\u201d\n \u201cShe\u2019s dreaming?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d Cuc said. A pause, then, very carefully: \u201cI think she\u2019s on Prime, Cousin. The data that\u2019s being broadcast\u2014it looks like Mind thought-processes, compressed with a high rate and all mixed together. There\u2019s probably something on the other end that decompresses the data and sends it to . . . Arg, I don\u2019t know! Wherever they think is appropriate.\u201d\n Lan Nhen bit back another admission of ignorance, and fell back on the commonplace. \u201cOn Prime.\u201d The enormity of the thing; that you could take a Mind\u2014a beloved ship with a family of her own\u2014that you could put her to sleep and cause her to wake up somewhere else, on an unfamiliar planet and an alien culture\u2014that you could just transplant her like a flower or a tree . . . \u201cShe\u2019s on Prime.\u201d\n \u201cIn a terminal or as the power source for something,\u201d Cuc said, darkly.\n \u201cWhy would they bother?\u201d Lan Nhen asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of power expenditure just to get an extra computer.\u201d\n \u201cDo I look as though I have insight into Outsiders?\u201d Lan Nhen could imagine Cuc throwing her hands up in the air, in that oft-practiced gesture. \u201cI\u2019m just telling you what I have, Cousin.\u201d\n Outsiders\u2014the Galactic Federation of United Planets\u2014were barely comprehensible in any case. They were the descendants of an Exodus fleet that had hit an isolated galaxy: left to themselves and isolated for decades, they had turned on each other in huge ethnic cleansings before emerging from their home planets as relentless competitors for resources and inhabitable planets.\n \u201cFine. Fine.\u201d Lan Nhen breathed in, slowly; tried to focus on the problem at hand. \u201cCan you walk me through cutting the radio broadcast?\u201d\n Cuc snorted. \u201cI\u2019d fix the ship, first, if I were you.\u201d\n Lan Nhen knelt by the equipment, and stared at a cable that had curled around one of the ship\u2019s spines. \u201cFine, let\u2019s start with what we came for. Can you see?\u201d\n Silence; and then a life-sized holo of Cuc hovered in front of her\u2014even though the avatar was little more than broad strokes, Great-great-aunt had still managed to render it in enough details to make it unmistakably Cuc. \u201cCute,\u201d Lan Nhen said.\n \u201cHahaha,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cNo bandwidth for trivialities\u2014gotta save for detail on your end.\u201d She raised a hand, pointed to one of the outermost screens on the edge of the room. \u201cDisconnect this one first.\u201d\n It was slow, and painful. Cuc pointed; and Lan Nhen checked before disconnecting and moving. Twice, she jammed her fingers very close to a cable, and felt electricity crackle near her\u2014entirely too close for comfort.\n They moved from the outskirts of the room to the center\u2014tackling the huge mount of equipment last. Cuc\u2019s first attempts resulted in a cable coming loose with an ominous sound; they waited, but nothing happened. \u201cWe might have fried something,\u201d Lan Nhen said.\n \u201cToo bad. There\u2019s no time for being cautious, as you well know. There\u2019s . . . maybe half an hour left before the other defenses go live.\u201d Cuc moved again, pointed to another squat terminal. \u201cThis goes off.\u201d\n When they were finished, Lan Nhen stepped back, to look at their handiwork.\n The heartroom was back to its former glory: instead of Outsider equipment, the familiar protrusions and sharp organic needles of the Mind\u2019s resting place; and they could see the Mind herself\u2014resting snug in her cradle, wrapped around the controls of the ship\u2014her myriad arms each seizing one rack of connectors; her huge head glinting in the light\u2014a vague globe shape covered with glistening cables and veins. The burn mark from the Outsider attack was clearly visible, a dark, elongated shape on the edge of her head that had bruised a couple of veins\u2014it had hit one of the connectors as well, burned it right down to the color of ink.\n Lan Nhen let out a breath she hadn\u2019t been aware of holding. \u201cIt scrambled the connector.\u201d\n \u201cAnd scarred her, but didn\u2019t kill her,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cJust like you said.\u201d\n \u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d But it was one thing to run simulations of the attack over and over, always getting the same prognosis; and quite another to see that the simulations held true, and that the damage was repairable.\n \u201cThere should be another connector rack in your bag,\u201d Cuc said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you through slotting it in.\u201d\n After she was done, Lan Nhen took a step back; and stared at her great-aunt\u2014feeling, in some odd way, as though she were violating the Mind\u2019s privacy. A Mind\u2019s heartroom was their stronghold, a place where they could twist reality as they wished, and appear as they wished to. To see her great-aunt like this, without any kind of appearance change or pretense, was . . . more disturbing than she\u2019d thought.\n \u201cAnd now?\u201d she asked Cuc.\n Even without details, Lan Nhen knew her cousin was smiling. \u201cNow we pray to our ancestors that cutting the broadcast is going to be enough to get her back.\u201d\n Another night on Prime, and Catherine wakes up breathless, in the grip of another nightmare\u2014images of red lights, and scrolling texts, and a feeling of growing cold in her bones, a cold so deep she cannot believe she will ever feel warm no matter how many layers she\u2019s put on.\n Johanna is not there; beside her, Jason sleeps, snoring softly; and she\u2019s suddenly seized by nausea, remembering what he said to her\u2014how casually he spoke of blocking her memories, of giving a home to her after stealing her original one from her. She waits for it to pass; waits to settle into her old life as usual. But it doesn\u2019t.\n Instead, she rises, walks towards the window, and stands watching Prime\u2014the clean wide streets, the perfect trees, the ballet of floaters at night\u2014the myriad dances that make up the society that constrains her from dawn to dusk and beyond\u2014she wonders what Johanna would say, but of course Johanna won\u2019t ever say anything anymore. Johanna has gone ahead, into the dark.\n The feeling of nausea in her belly will not go away: instead it spreads, until her body feels like a cage\u2014at first, she thinks the sensation is in her belly, but it moves upwards, until her limbs, too, feel too heavy and too small\u2014until it\u2019s an effort to move any part of her. She raises her hands, struggling against a feeling of moving appendages that don\u2019t belong to her\u2014and traces the contours of her face, looking for familiar shapes, for anything that will anchor her to reality. The heaviness spreads, compresses her chest until she can hardly breathe\u2014cracks her ribs and pins her legs to the ground. Her head spins, as if she were about to faint; but the mercy of blackness does not come to her.\n \u201cCatherine,\u201d she whispers. \u201cMy name is Catherine.\u201d\n Another name, unbidden, rises to her lips. Mi Chau. A name she gave to herself in the Viet language\u2014in the split instant before the lasers took her apart, before she sank into darkness: Mi Chau, the princess who unwittingly betrayed her father and her people, and whose blood became the pearls at the bottom of the sea. She tastes it on her tongue, and it\u2019s the only thing that seems to belong to her anymore.\n She remembers that first time\u2014waking up on Prime in a strange body, struggling to breathe, struggling to make sense of being so small, so far away from the stars that had guided her through space\u2014remembers walking like a ghost through the corridors of the Institution, until the knowledge of what the Galactics had done broke her, and she cut her veins in a bathroom, watching blood lazily pool at her feet and thinking only of escape. She remembers the second time she woke up; the second, oblivious life as Catherine.\n Johanna. Johanna didn\u2019t survive her second life; and even now is starting her third, somewhere in the bowels of the Institution\u2014a dark-skinned child indistinguishable from other dark-skinned children, with no memories of anything beyond a confused jumble . . .\n Outside, the lights haven\u2019t dimmed, but there are stars\u2014brash and alien, hovering above Prime, in configurations that look wrong; and she remembers, suddenly, how they lay around her, how they showed her the way from planet to planet\u2014how the cold of the deep spaces seized her just as she entered them to travel faster, just like it\u2019s holding her now, seizing her bones\u2014remembers how much larger, how much wider she ought to be . . .\n There are stars everywhere; and superimposed on them, the faces of two Dai Viet women, calling her over and over. Calling her back, into the body that belonged to her all along; into the arms of her family.\n \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d the women whisper, and their voices are stronger than any other noise; than Jason\u2019s breath in the bedroom; than the motors of the floaters or the vague smell of garlic from the kitchen. \u201cCome on, Great-aunt!\u201d\n She is more than this body; more than this constrained life\u2014her thoughts spread out, encompassing hangars and living quarters; and the liquid weight of pods held in their cradles\u2014she remembers family reunions, entire generations of children putting their hands on her corridors, remembers the touch of their skin on her metal walls; the sound of their laughter as they raced each other; the quiet chatter of their mothers in the heartroom, keeping her company as the New Year began; and the touch of a brush on her outer hull, drawing the shape of an apricot flower, for good luck . . .\n \u201cCatherine?\u201d Jason calls behind her.\n She turns, through sheer effort of will; finding, somehow, the strength to maintain her consciousness in a small and crammed body alongside her other, vaster one. He\u2019s standing with one hand on the doorjamb, staring at her\u2014his face pale, leached of colors in the starlight.\n \u201cI remember,\u201d she whispers.\n His hands stretch, beseeching. \u201cCatherine, please. Don\u2019t leave.\u201d\n He means well, she knows. All the things that he hid from her, he hid out of love; to keep her alive and happy, to hold her close in spite of all that should have separated them; and even now, the thought of his love is a barb in her heart, a last lingering regret, slight and pitiful against the flood of her memories\u2014but not wholly insignificant.\n Where she goes, she\u2019ll never be alone\u2014not in the way she was with Jason, feeling that nothing else but her mattered in the entire world. She\u2019ll have a family; a gaggle of children and aunts and uncles waiting on her, but nothing like the sweet, unspoiled privacy where Jason and she could share anything and everything. She won\u2019t have another lover like him\u2014na\u00efve and frank and so terribly sure of what he wants and what he\u2019s ready to do to get it. Dai Viet society has no place for people like Jason\u2014who do not know their place, who do not know how to be humble, how to accept failure or how to bow down to expediency.\n Where she goes, she\u2019ll never be alone; and yet she\u2019ll be so terribly lonely.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d Jason says.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll come back\u2014\u201d a promise made to him; to Johanna, who cannot hear or recognize her anymore. Her entire being spreads out, thins like water thrown on the fire\u2014and, in that last moment, she finds herself reaching out for him, trying to touch him one last time, to catch one last glimpse of his face, even as a heart she didn\u2019t know she had breaks.\n \u201cCatherine.\u201d\n He whispers her name, weeping, over and over; and it\u2019s that name, that lie that still clings to her with its bittersweet memories, that she takes with her as her entire being unfolds\u2014as she flies away, towards the waiting stars.\n Originally published in The Other Half of the Sky, edited by Athena Andreadis and Kay Holt.\n Aliette de Bodard lives and works in Paris.

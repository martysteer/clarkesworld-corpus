At the time, I\u2019d read more of his science fiction than his fantasy; I preferred his Hammers Slammers and military SF to his Republic of Cinnabar Navy (RCN) series and other space opera fiction.\n What I\u2019d read had moved me deeply and answered many questions I\u2019d had about my grandfather\u2019s and my father\u2019s experiences in the military. I\u2019ve long admired Drake\u2019s ability to talk and write openly about his experiences in Vietnam and Cambodia and to reveal the horrors of war through powerful storytelling\u2014to shed light on the unlightable darkness.\n If more of our combat veterans could write with clarity and effectiveness, maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014there\u2019d be fewer wars.\n Over the years, I\u2019ve continued to gravitate toward his grimmer fiction, with a special fondness for the stories in Grimmer than Hell and the novel Redliners, and for the oddball novel-in-stories and homage to Manly Wade Wellman, Old Nathan.\n But, honestly, I love all his books. These books go past mere entertainment for me. They move me. They get under my skin. They become a part of me.\n Drake and I have spoken and corresponded, on and off the record, since we first met and we\u2019ve agreed to disagree on one fundamental point. I believe that he is an important science fiction and fantasy writer\u2014and important writer, regardless of genre. He doesn\u2019t.\n It is not false modesty.\n \u201cI think I am a first-rate craftsman,\u201d said Drake, \u201cand that is not a small thing. My dad was a first-rate electrician. His father was possibly the best sheet-metal smith in the United States. I\u2019m a craftsman also and I am damn proud of it, but nobody\u2019s ever heard of my father or my grandfather and there\u2019s no particular reason they should\u2019ve heard of me. But I\u2019m proud of the craft.\u201d\n Below, Drake and I talk about the craft and the work. We talk about plotting, plodding, and language. He opts for lean prose and weighty ideas.\n Language shouldn\u2019t be there to show what a fine writer the storyteller is, according to Drake. Language shouldn\u2019t clothe ideas is fancy garb. Language should, as Drake says below, describe a scene \u201cclearly and simply to the reader.\u201d\n In the 70s and 80s, Drake took \u201cshow and don\u2019t tell\u201d to heart and was, as he put it, \u201cpilloried by the critics as being pro-war because I didn\u2019t say I was anti-war. I described things that any sane person would find horrific. God knows, I found them horrific. But I didn\u2019t say so. Of course, I opposed these things. Any idiot would know that. But, of course, they didn\u2019t.\u201d\n It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone reading a pro-war agenda into Drake\u2019s fiction, but part of the power of well-crafted fiction is, I suppose, that it invites multiple interpretations.\n As a follow-up to a visit to Drake\u2019s home this past summer, we spoke on the telephone this fall. I caught him \u201ctrying to get into plotting the next one\u201d and he wasn\u2019t \u201cthere yet.\u201d The \u201cnext one\u201d was the fourth and final book in the Books of the Elements series for Tor. \u201cPlotting\u201d will ultimately result in a 10- or 15,000 words plot outline.\n Is it hard to go from summarizing what happens to dramatizing what happens?\n No. I had dinner years ago with Stephen King and I mentioned how I plotted. He looked at me and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you get really bored when you\u2019re writing it?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d But obviously, he would\u2019ve. [Laughing] Obviously, his way works, too. His way works for him.\n What\u2019s holding you up with this one?\n I\u2019m just starting it. It always takes me a couple of months to get started. It\u2019s an exhausting job to write a novel and when I finish I am just totally wrung out. Mentally, I want to dive right into the next novel, but frankly I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know that anybody could. Oh, that\u2019s not true. Some people definitely could. But I\u2019m not them.\n Right now I am reading the Dionysiaca of Nonnos, the conquest of India. I\u2019m gathering. I\u2019m jotting down little bits. I\u2019ve gone through a book of Indian folklore. I\u2019m going over past notes and excerpting. It\u2019s just a matter of getting a mass of stuff. I know where this one is going, but with 150,000 words, there\u2019s a lot of business and it\u2019s just a matter of getting that business down.\n So when you say you\u2019re \u201ctrying to get into plotting the next one,\u201d it\u2019s more about recovering from the previous one, than something unique about this one.\n Yeah. It\u2019s always like this. There\u2019s nothing particularly difficult about this one. I did a novelette after I finished the previous novel but that doesn\u2019t really count. That was sort of a break. Now I am trying to focus on the novel.\n I did the third of the Elements series, then I did the plot outline for the second of the Hinterlands series that John [Lambshead] is writing called Into the Maelstrom\u2014he\u2019s working on that now\u2014then I did the next RCN novel. You know, bang, bang, without a lot of rest. It was really pretty hard doing the RCN novel like that. It was just a lot of work. But, you know, that\u2019s what they pay me for.\n I don\u2019t especially like to do plot outlines for other people, but in this case I\u2019d done the Into the Hinterlands outline quite a long time ago, mid-90s, I guess, and [the contracted writer] didn\u2019t get around to writing it, so Toni [Weisskopf] wound up giving it to John Lambshead to execute and she was pleased with the result, but [laughing] that meant that I had to plot the other two novels in the series. I\u2019m not planning to do more plot outlines for other people but I do have one more to do for John just because it\u2019s sort of grandfathered in.\n I wonder if going from RCN, which is filled with characters that you\u2019ve spent years with, to this fourth book in a series which is, intellectually, one of your most challenging\u2014\n I keep trying to push.\n You come off an uphill climb and now you\u2019re at an even steeper climb\u2014straight up a cliff. What\u2019ve you gotten yourself into, here?\n The thing is, it\u2019s all volunteer. And that\u2019s an important thing. Nobody is doing this to me. If it fails, I screwed up. And that\u2019s okay. I mean, I\u2019m okay with the thought that if I screw up and fail, I should fail. That pushes me to try and do it right. Now, I don\u2019t need a lot of push in that direction. But my friend Mark [Van Name] pointed out something to me years ago\u2014he pointed out that when I did Northworld, it really tore me apart. I was having back spasms so serious just out of tension that my left leg was numb for a few weeks after I\u2019d gotten the book done. I was really doing something new. He said, \u201cNow you\u2019re doing the Isles series. Each of those books is more complex than Northworld was and you just take it in stride.\u201d I thought about that, and yeah, you do, you learn new stuff by doing it.\n I think I\u2019m probably best known for my action writing and I certainly try to do good action and I think I do good action. But I have a history and Latin background and I graduated from a first class law school. If I didn\u2019t like intellectual puzzles, I wouldn\u2019t have that background.\n It almost seems like you have two identities with the two different publishers. There\u2019s the Baen writer\u2014science fiction, action\u2014and the Tor writer\u2014fantasy, more intellectual\u2014and those two writers aren\u2019t always thought of as being the same person.\n I am writing very simple, clear, direct prose. No matter what I am writing. That\u2019s not the perception of me, certainly not in Fantasy but even in SF. I like to think that all my work is done at a high intellectual level, because it\u2019s no fun if it isn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean I have to show people that I am smart. The work ought to do that. I don\u2019t need to throw in long words. Because I know long words. I don\u2019t have to throw in Latin because I know Latin. As a matter of fact, I make a point of always translating any Latin that I\u2019m using.\n The simplicity of the language goes straight to the ideas. The ideas are not simple, not easily digested, which may contribute to the . . . complexity of the perception of your work. It\u2019s not easy to say what your work is or what your work isn\u2019t, because you\u2019ve tapped into the truth and the truth is not easily simplified. It is complicated. Show me a simple sentence in a Hammer\u2019s Slammers short story and it will probably tell me something that I can\u2019t discuss simply.\n [Laughing] Probably tell you something you didn\u2019t want to know. People shouldn\u2019t read a book and say, \u201cThis is beautifully written.\u201d They ought to say, \u201cWow, was that a story!\u201d Same thing with a speech, by the way. This is something I was taught long, long ago in speech class. If people leave the auditorium saying, \u201cOh, that was a wonderful speech,\u201d you\u2019ve failed. You want them to say, \u201cBy God, we\u2019ve got to do something about this problem!\u201d It\u2019s a whole different thing. Critics will be more positively impressed by fine language than they will be by simple language that communicates thoughts. They will. It\u2019s just a reality.\n You\u2019ve said before that what Baen Books does well is find and publish stories, and that a good story is a good story. But, uh . . . what makes a good story?\n A good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Honestly, that implies an arc that implies things are happening and that\u2019s as close as I can come to it. My friend Mark says, arguing that Baen focuses on story\u2014he says that there isn\u2019t an editor in the business who will say, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in story\u201d or even \u201cI\u2019m not primarily interested in a good story.\u201d Baen Books isn\u2019t different in that way, but the result is different. I think in many cases if you come out of a literary background you will focus on literary values\u2014language, vocabulary, complexity of sentence structure\u2014all of which are marks of fine writing and fine writing is seriously the enemy describing a scene clearly and simply to the reader and I really think it\u2019s important to if you\u2019re telling a story to tell it in a simple direct fashion rather than to worry abut the beauty of your prose. I\u2019m not against beautiful prose. But clarity of expression is a mark of good storytelling.\n Backing up, once you have the plot outline, how does your life change for the next how many ever months?\n I get up in the morning. I read the portion I did yesterday and make quick edits on it. This is partially reading myself into the process. Then I sit with the outline beside me and I write the next portion. I have it broken out into scenes in the outline and I write the next scene. Some days I finish a scene or start a scene or sometimes it feels like I\u2019ve been battering on this forever and it may be five days before I finish the damn scene. That\u2019s usually because it\u2019s long and because it\u2019s difficult for some reason that doesn\u2019t involve the work itself. It\u2019s where my head is and other stuff going on and all that.\n Mark has said that once I get started I\u2019m just a machine and that\u2019s kind of true and I want it to be that way. I\u2019ve done all the hard part. I\u2019ve got all the cute little bits. Sure, I break scenes up, I change stuff, and I move stuff around. Going from 15,000 words to 150,000 words obviously there\u2019s a lot of addition going on, but it\u2019s mechanical. The writing can be a slog.\n Do you ever just put a title at the top of the page and go.\n I used to do it all the time in the 60s and 70s. And I didn\u2019t finish stories. I tried it with novels. I spent 12 years after I sold my first story trying to write a novel. And I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d poop out. I\u2019d get into the middle of it and I\u2019d be convinced it was crap and I wouldn\u2019t finish it. Nowadays when I\u2019m in the middle of a novel, I\u2019m convinced it\u2019s crap but I finish it, because it\u2019s just a matter of plodding forward and I want to hang myself and I\u2019m convinced that \u201cI was able to do this before but I\u2019ve completely just lost it and they\u2019d be better off reading the phone book\u201d but I keep on going. I\u2019m very depressed, but you know, frankly, on a good day I\u2019m pretty depressed anyway [laughing].\n So there\u2019s a lot of sunshine in this process?\n There are various ways of dealing with the situation [of writing a novel], but any one that works for you is okay . . . My way works for me. I haven\u2019t hanged myself thus far.\n Is the plotting part linear?\n The first portion of it is to gather a huge amount of data, not infrequently saying, \u201cThis will work!\u201d When I say that, I\u2019m not really sure where it will work or how it will work but \u201coh, that\u2019s a good bit, I need to use that\u201d and when I get a huge amount of data then I start putting it together into either a plot outline or a series of individual sequences; that is, if I have multiple viewpoints and I generally do if I\u2019m writing a long novel. I may start out trying to run a sequence of one character, one viewpoint, and then do another or I may try to do a chapter from all two or four viewpoints or a combination of these. It tends to be slightly different every time which puzzles me. I\u2019m not consciously doing it in different fashions but it always is and I don\u2019t know what that means.\n Is there a visual element. Do you map or draw things out?\n In the sense you mean, I\u2019ll choreograph battles and I\u2019ll choreograph dinner tables. I need to know where all these people are sitting.\n But I will also have a picture of an 18th century dining room beside me or a picture of this hotel in Boise, Idaho in front of me. I have lots and lots of things with pictures in them and I\u2019ll think, \u201cI want something of this sort of tone,\u201d and I\u2019ll grab a volume out and start paging through until I find \u201coh, that\u2019ll do for it\u201d or \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I was thinking of, but I can use it very well for this purpose and it will make it different in this fashion.\u201d\n You do a good bit of writing outdoors, too, don\u2019t you?\n All of it. I do my work on two laptops and then I save my work to a base unit, which is a desktop. Then I\u2019ll call it up for the next burst. I sit in different places according to what the weather is and where the sun is. Either I want to be in the sun or out of the sun. I am never in exactly the same place at any two periods of work.\n Was the Northworld series the last of the landmark, stressful books?\n Nothing else has been as physically stressful. There was one I did\u2014ARC Riders\u2014which was a collaboration but I wrote, I think, all but six sections. It was the editor\u2019s idea and she thought it would be a good idea to start this alternate history book in a world in which the Vietnam War hadn\u2019t ended. I said, \u201cOkay, I can do that.\u201d And I could do it. It made me very, very, very depressed. And I decided I would never go directly back\u2014that wasn\u2019t really direct, but you know what I mean\u2014into Vietnam, again.\n There were also the Tom Kelly books, Skyripper and Fortress. Those were an idea of Tom Doherty\u2019s. They were stressful in a different way because there is a lot of similarity between me and the viewpoint character Tom Kelly. That\u2019s me on a really bad day, the mindset. The hell of it is, it\u2019s a way I could\u2019ve gone and I didn\u2019t. By great determination, I did not go that way. He\u2019s a man who\u2019s really consumed with anger, and I\u2019m not that man but I wasn\u2019t making it up either and I think that was difficult for the people around me and I would not have done another one except Tom really, really pushed me for one. He said later when I sent him the intro for the combined edition, Loose Cannon, \u201cGee, Dave, if I\u2019d known you hated it that much I wouldn\u2019t have made you do it.\u201d [Laughing] I said, \u201cTom, I told you I didn\u2019t want to do it!\u201d\n That\u2019s one of those cases where I\u2019m staying calm and people aren\u2019t listening to what I\u2019m saying they\u2019re listening to how I\u2019m saying it. Oh, well!\n Two things with those books: they very directly approach things that are difficult to deal with\u2014Vietnam and your anger there was someone else involved in the conception of the idea. Those two things say, \u201cMove out, Dave\u2019s going to be difficult to live with.\u201d\n [Laughing] He was. But I\u2019m a saintly human being now. [More laughter.]\n No college writing colleges or MFA programs for you, eh?\n It\u2019s a completely different mindset. It\u2019s fine for the people who want it, but it isn\u2019t what I wanted. Some of them it\u2019s worked out well for. I think in some cases it\u2019s been very seriously damaging. [A science fiction writer] can be taught to loathe the thing he does well [in a workshop].\n I wonder, when you write non-fiction about Vietnam, is that as stressful?\n No. I\u2019ve always told the truth. As the years go on, I\u2019m even more willing to tell the truth. I\u2019ve never lied. I wasn\u2019t any kind of hero, and I\u2019ve never claimed that. Considered clinically, nothing happened to me. Then Mark [Van Name] sat me down and said, \u201cDid you see this? Did this happen to you? Did you do this?\u201d \u201cYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\u201d Mark said, \u201cYou realize any of the things I just mentioned would be five years of therapy for a civilian.\u201d\n Stories you told me ten years ago about your experiences in Vietnam still haunt me, and I\u2019m very removed from them.\n Be glad.\n So, I guess there\u2019s no point in even asking if you\u2019d want to write a mainstream novel with no fantastical elements.\n Not only \u201cno,\u201d but \u201chell no.\u201d I write what I do for a reason. And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m too dumb to figure out there\u2019s another thing to do.\n Jeremy L. C. Jones is a freelance writer, editor, and teacher.

Xiao Zhu is behind me with the paint pots, whistling something tuneless to himself. I\u2019ve got a brush in my hand and a delicate tracework of flowers in front of me; there\u2019s a job to be done, and Lao Yang is waiting. But all I can think of is the stars.\n We don\u2019t see them that often, not the real ones. On the streets of Beijing you can see them every night, a glorious winking parade for the people who made them, but in the courtyards, the behind-spaces where we live and work and play, we just see clouds. Ever since I was a boy, there\u2019s been a roof of smog over my head. And these days people think there\u2019s something suspicious about stars. They\u2019re for farmers and foreigners and dissidents, people who know how to find them and still want to. But they\u2019re up there tonight, faint specks in the muck, and my hands go still as I stare.\n Lao Yang coughs behind me. It\u2019s a smoker\u2019s cough, full of sound and fury, but it\u2019s also a warning: there\u2019s a job to be done. I turn my eyes to the roof beam, to the beautiful tracery of blossoms and leaves, and begin to fill in the green. Xiao Zhu begins to wander the courtyard, a young man\u2019s amble, taking in the neat tiles and the potted pomegranate in one corner. Lao Yang just waits.\n The paint takes shape under my brush as if it were a living thing. Red, green, blue, gold; it drifts across the wood and makes it real. When I have chased the last of the color into the corners, Lao Yang helps me down the ladder, and the three of us look up in silence at what we have done.\n \u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d he says.\n I nod.\n \u201cThree months\u2019 work,\u201d he says.\n I nod again.\n We walk out onto the street, sharing a steady silence between us. Xiao Zhu is already busy at the gate, stabbing at a small control panel with his slim fingers. We turn and look at the image of a house, the stone lions guarding its door, its roof beams painted like a sunrise. Above us, the false stars shine clear and unadorned.\n Xiao Zhu hits the switch, and the hologram collapses. There is a quiet shimmer, and then nothing. The street remains unchanged.\n Lao Yang smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d\n It starts out like that, but that\u2019s not where it started. It started fifteen years ago, when the hutongs disappeared. Those narrow alleys, pinpricked by public toilets and hawkers, the sights and the sounds and the pervasive smells, and on either side the courtyard houses, the heritage of Beijing. They were already vanishing by the close of the twentieth century, whole stretches of history being leveled to make way for apartments and poor-quality condos. A lucky few were protected, turned into tourist traps and holiday homes. Gulou, Nanluoguxiang, Liulichang Jie: their names trip off our tongues like ancient mnemonics. But eventually, they too disappeared.\n Lao Yang was forty when he saw the demolition sign go up above his door. He lived in a protected hutong, a heritage-listed area. When he went to register his protests with the local authorities, he was waylaid by plainclothes agents and beaten. That was the day the first hologram went up, in front of the place Lao Yang used to call home. Seen from the street, it looked like any other courtyard house, elegant and serene. From behind, it was a sick pile of rubble. He tells us over and over how he could put his hand through the mirage, how in that moment what he saw and what the world saw changed forever.\n The next day, Lao Yang\u2019s whole street was cloaked in holograms. The usual smog had subsided into a pearly blue. The crude demolition notices had vanished from the doors, to be replaced by fresh coats of vermillion paint. Lao Yang looked at them and knew that there was rubble waiting behind. And the holograms spread, street after street, so fast you could see a workman in the morning and know your whole district would be gone in the afternoon. I was just a boy when it happened, but I remember the spread of blue skies and green leaves like it was Chinese New Year. I didn\u2019t understand back then. All I knew was that the city was beautiful, and I never wanted to leave.\n I understand now. People believe what they see. These government holograms, they make Beijing a dream town, a false perfection that follows you home and leaves you at the door. We don\u2019t see the demolition, the shaky buildings, the squalor. There are clear skies every day even though it hurts to breathe. We are a city of flickering images, of fantasy, of fraud, and nobody objects because nobody sees anything to object to. There are stars above us at night. Who cares where they come from?\n We troop out of the hutong in single file, Lao Yang, Xiao Zhu and me. We never talk much after a job: we have done something majestic, something monstrous, and the silence is almost holy. We make our way through the winding streets like an ant trail, left, right and left again, until we reach the main road, bustling with cars. Xiao Zhu flags a taxi and bargains the price down to something we can afford. He sits in the front and we sit in the back, while the driver putters us home.\n I met Lao Yang three years ago in a dingy noodle shop which had looked much cleaner from the outside. We were sitting side by side, slurping our noodles like some triumphant symphony. I had a book propped up against the vinegar pot and was considering it thoughtfully as I chewed. Not that I\u2019m an intellectual or anything; I\u2019m a man who works with his hands. But I like books. There\u2019s something honest about a printed page. You know what it is today, and you can make a fair guess at what it\u2019s going to be tomorrow.\n Lao Yang peered over at my paperback. \u2018You\u2019re reading,\u201d he observed.\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d\n I hooked a noodle out of my bowl. \u201cI like words,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou a writer?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cJust a laborer.\u201d\n Lao Yang considered this. Then he grunted. \u201cLet\u2019s have a few beers.\u201d\n I guess that\u2019s where it really started: me and Lao Yang, getting drunk together in a deadbeat little noodle shop like any other in Beijing. That\u2019s when he told me about what had happened to his home, the place he\u2019d brought his wife back to and the place where his children grew up. He told me he had a plan to bring back the hutongs, as good as they\u2019d been or better. He already knew a kid who could manipulate the hologram systems, knock out the feed to a single house. All we had to do was rebuild the ruins behind it, hit the switch, and watch the fantasy be replaced with something real.\n We\u2019ve restored twenty-odd courtyard houses so far. Some of them have been left vacant and fallen into disrepair; these are the small jobs, just repairing and repainting and finally, hitting the switch. The bigger jobs are the houses which were actually destroyed, demolished to make way for property developments which never came around. These we rebuild, brick and timber and roof tiles, until the only difference between the house and the hologram is the color of the sky. We are the quietest dissidents in Beijing. When we do our job right, nobody knows we were ever there. But little by little, the three of us are fighting to bring the barrier between truth and illusion down.\n Home is the first courtyard house we ever fixed up, on the outskirts of Gulou. Lao Yang\u2019s house. When we arrived it was little better than a heap; now a crab-apple tree hangs lazily over the courtyard, and goldfish drift in the ornamental urns. The only furniture we have has been salvaged from demolition sites, old moth-eaten futons and wobbly tables, giving the place an eccentric, creaking charm. We\u2019ve never been able to afford to buy new things for ourselves.\n Xiao Zhu goes into the kitchen to boil water for noodles. I join him, helping to shake the little flat cakes out of the packets and into the bowls.\n \u201cYou did a good job today,\u201d he says. \u201cAll those colors. Really pretty.\u201d\n \u201cYou too,\u201d I say, tearing open a seasoning sachet.\n I never quite know what to say to Xiao Zhu. He\u2019s a young guy, good with all the technology which has long since left me and Lao Yang behind. He\u2019s got a thick mop of hair and a rakish smile and he dances when he walks. He could\u2019ve been a TV idol, but he became a dissident instead. He\u2019s the one who works the holograms for us, when all the hard labor is done; he helps out here and there with the painting and tiling, but his real job is something I can\u2019t even begin to understand. I don\u2019t know where Lao Yang found him. But he\u2019s part of the secret, and that makes him family. I just wish I knew what to say.\n We carry the steaming bowls of noodles out to the courtyard and sit down. Lao Yang hawks and spits into the bushes, picks up his chopsticks and digs in. Xiao Zhu and I eat slowly, making each bite last. When we\u2019re done, Lao Yang lights up a cigarette, puts his feet up and eyes us across the table.\n \u201cThat was our twenty-eighth house,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom here in Gulou to Chenxiang Jie and out to Dongjiaominxiang, we have brought twenty-eight courtyard houses back to reality. Nobody knows it but us, but we are making the past the present, and the present the truth of the past. The future is ours. And I think it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n \u201cDouble prosperity,\u201d I murmur.\n \u201cDouble prosperity,\u201d Lao Yang agrees. \u201cTwenty-eight is an auspicious number. We\u2019ve talked about this before, and I think we\u2019re ready. There\u2019s a jewel at the heart of this city, a treasure lying forgotten, and it needs to be saved. We can save it, if we\u2019re willing to try.\u201d\n \u201cThe Forbidden City?\u201d says Xiao Zhu. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about the Forbidden City again? It\u2019s massive. We\u2019d be dead before we finished.\u201d\n \u201cNot if we had help,\u201d says Lao Yang, and a gleam creeps into his eyes. \u201cWhat have we been playing at, these past three years? Pockets of reality here and there. Drops in an ocean. But if we could rebuild the palace\u2014shut the holograms off and let people see the truth through the haze\u2014that\u2019d be worth dying for. I know a guy. He\u2019s got a construction company. He\u2019ll come in and help us for a price. We can do it! Give the people back their history! The government thinks they own our futures. Let\u2019s fight them with the past!\u201d\n I pick up our bowls, toss the chopsticks in with a clatter. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it,\u201d I say. And then, apropos of nothing: \u201cIf the past and the present and the future had a battle, who would win?\u201d\n \u201cThe future,\u201d Xiao Zhu says softly. \u201cThe future always wins.\u201d\n The next day, I head over to Houhai to see my girlfriend. She\u2019s a sweet thing, a little younger than me, and has no idea what I get up to in the small hours of the night. Sometimes I think I should marry her, but then I remember I have no money, no job, no future. I am a down-and-out hero, not a husband. At these times I hold her tighter, kissing her with a sweet desperation; when she finds out the truth, we are finished. But the sun is bright today, the holographic sky projecting a deep and powerful blue, and we walk around the lake hand in hand while she chatters about her extensive circle of friends. I drift in and out, thinking about what Lao Yang said. Restoring the Forbidden City. Bringing it back to reality. Could we really pull it off?\n \u201cOh!\u201d my girlfriend exclaims, her eyes falling on a nearby shop. \u201cThey\u2019ve put up the lanterns for the festival!\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re not real lanterns,\u201d I sigh. \u201cThey\u2019ve just altered the hologram.\u201d\n \u201cHologram, real lanterns, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty!\u201d\n She rushes over to the shop and insists on posing for a photo, two fingers up in a cheeky V-sign. I dutifully hold her bag and snap the picture with her smartphone, assuring her she looks beautiful in every way.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to eat so many mooncakes this year,\u201d she says. \u201cI always do. Every year when they come out in the shops, I go in and scold them. You\u2019re going to make me so fat! I say. But I just can\u2019t resist them.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re not fat,\u201d I say absentmindedly. I\u2019m thinking about the palace, how we\u2019re going to shingle those roofs. Then my phone buzzes in my pocket. It\u2019s Xiao Zhu.\n \u201cThey\u2019ve got Lao Yang,\u201d he gasps.\n I stop dead. \u201cWho has?\u201d\n \u201cThe cops. Or someone like them. That guy he met was a plant, or a rat, or something. They grabbed him this morning on his way to where they were meeting. I don\u2019t know where they took him. I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ve gone.\u201d\n \u201cCalm down,\u201d I say, trying to sound soothing without arousing my girlfriend\u2019s suspicions. \u201cWhere are you now?\u201d\n \u201cBack at the house. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ll be safe here, though. He\u2019ll have to tell them everything.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m coming over right now,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll get a cab.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t take the first one,\u201d he says, and hangs up.\n Xiao Zhu is pacing the length of our courtyard, one of Lao Yang\u2019s cigarettes on his lips. The smog is thick today, outside the holographic curtain, and I have to squint to see him.\n \u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he says. \u201cHim and his fucking double prosperity. They\u2019ll come for us, and we\u2019ll never see the light of day again. Not that we are now. Not that we ever have.\u201d\n I sag onto one of our dilapidated couches. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s still the two of us. You can work the holograms, and I can do everything else. It\u2019ll take us longer to finish a house, but it\u2019s what he\u2019d want us to do. To keep going. To keep making things real.\u201d\n Xiao Zhu snorts. \u201cYou\u2019re just like him. Big dreams. Today the Forbidden City, tomorrow the stars. What are you in it for anyway? What are you hoping to change?\u201d\n I start to speak, and then pause. What am I in it for? I loved the holograms as a kid. I remember people cheering when they switched them on in our street, watching the sky turn blue and the grass turn green. We never even had grass before. But then I grew up, and one day I realized I hadn\u2019t seen the sun for ten years. Not the real sun. Not the stars. And I started looking at houses and shops I had known all my life with suspicion. What did they really look like? I knew what they looked like inside, because government-sponsored holograms stop at the door. But the truth of them was as foreign to me as if I had never seen them before.\n When Lao Yang approached me that day, I slurped at my noodles and listened to a dream. He wanted to live in Beijing\u2014not a copy or a model, but a real city, a city that breathed, a city that had shit on the pavement and smog in the air but was free, effervescent and alive. He wanted a place that could move from past to present to future of its own accord, without technological intervention. He wanted his home back. And I wanted to help him.\n \u201cI\u2019m in it because sometimes you just fight,\u201d I say, finally. \u201cAnd you keep fighting until it\u2019s done. Lao Yang\u2019s out there. He\u2019s an old man and he\u2019s hurting. But he\u2019s helped you, and he\u2019s helped me, and I\u2019m not going to let him disappear. I said something dumb before. I said there\u2019s still the two of us. That\u2019s not true. There\u2019s three like there always was. I\u2019m going to try and help him. And you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d\n Xiao Zhu lights another cigarette, blows the smoke out into the haze. \u201cNice speech, big guy. In a battle between the past, present and future, who would you be?\u201d\n I growl. \u201cThe future. The future always wins.\u201d\n Two days later, we have the names of the people who took Lao Yang and where they\u2019re hiding him. Xiao Zhu bribed a local guard and wouldn\u2019t tell me where he got the money. We have a plan, too, but I don\u2019t trust it. It relies too much on gadgets, on things I\u2019ve never learned to think of as real. This is Xiao Zhu\u2019s world, and it makes me uncomfortable. But there\u2019s nowhere else to turn.\n We\u2019re standing in front of the Ru Jia hostel in east Chaoyang. Just like home!, the sign proclaims, and I believe it. I\u2019ve met plenty of people who get beaten at home. Behind this facade is a black jail, an illegal holding facility for protesters and political dissidents. This is where they\u2019re keeping Lao Yang, stripped naked and starving, pulpy and bruised; for once, I don\u2019t have to see it to know that it\u2019s true.\n I look over at Xiao Zhu. \u201cReady?\u201d I ask.\n He nods, and pulls the hope of our whole campaign out of his pocket. It\u2019s a portable holographic projector, powerful enough to generate a large object or change the appearance of a room. I have no idea where he got it; they\u2019re normally only found in large hotels or function halls, helping to create a dream wedding at a fraction of the cost. He studies it intently, thumbing buttons as he perfects the image, confirming every last detail. A guard left the building half an hour ago, and I watch over Xiao Zhu\u2019s shoulder as he is recreated, down to the pores on his skin, on an alien machine.\n \u201cReady,\u201d Xiao Zhu says at last. He pushes a button, and the guard flickers into existence by our side. My stomach lurches involuntarily. If something like this passed me on the street, I\u2019d think it was real. Xiao Zhu curls his hand around the projector, concealing it from sight, and the two of us walk up the steps of the Ru Jia with our holographic guard close behind.\n \u201cYou programmed the speech?\u201d I whisper.\n \u201cEverything you said,\u201d Xiao Zhu replies. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n I knock on the door, then jump back behind the guard and try to look penitent. The door opens a fraction and a man peers out.\n \u201cYeah?\u201d\n \u201cI got \u2019em, sir,\u201d the false guard says. \u201cThe two that were with Lao Yang. Figured I\u2019d drop them off here until the courts decide where they belong. Should I throw them in with their pal?\u201d\n \u201cDo that,\u201d the man says, \u201cdo that. Make sure they feel welcome, too\u2014ha, ha!\u201d\n \u201cYessir,\u201d says our guard. \u201cI\u2019ll treat them just right, don\u2019t you worry about that.\u201d The door creaks open further, and we step inside.\n The first thing that hits us when we enter the jail is the darkness. The second is the stench. Somewhere in another room a woman is sobbing, an endless, throaty sob that sounds like it could eat up the whole world. For the first time in years, I find myself longing for the comfort of holograms. Our false guard leads us down the corridor to the room where Lao Yang is being held; as we get closer, the stench grows stronger, and I start to panic. When we stop, it\u2019s at Room 28. Double prosperity. I want to cry.\n I open the door. It\u2019s not locked\u2014the people here know what happens if they run. Lao Yang is lying in a ball on his bed, shaking in time to some unknown beat in his head. There\u2019s dried blood on the sheets, and a dank smell in the air. I run to him. \u201cLao Yang, it\u2019s me,\u201d I say. I say it over and over, willing him to respond. At last he raises his head, a distant look in his eyes. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it is.\u201d\n We lift him to his feet, cradling his body and wincing as each new bruise is revealed. Xiao Zhu takes the clothes we\u2019ve brought from his pack, and we dress him as gently as we can, first pants and then arms up for the shirt. Lao Yang says nothing as we fuss over him, swaying unsteadily like a sapling in the wind. It is as if knowledge and years have all been beaten out of him, leaving him back as he began, an empty seed. When I reach out to him, I find myself stroking his hair as I would a child\u2019s.\n \u201cWe should get moving,\u201d Xiao Zhu says. \u201cI\u2019ve reprogrammed the projector.\u201d\n \u201cJust give me a minute,\u201d I say. I look at the old man twitching feverishly in my grip, try to catch my gaze with his own. \u201cLao Yang, we\u2019re going to get you out of here now. Just think of this time as a hologram. It was a bad one, but we\u2019re going to hit the switch and bring you back to reality. You\u2019ll never need to be afraid again.\u201d\n Lao Yang\u2019s gaze wavers, but he nods. I turn to Xiao Zhu. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\n We pack up the bag and sneak out into the corridor, Lao Yang hobbling between us. The guard is slouched by the door, watching some trashy late-night television and tossing sunflower seeds into his mouth.\n \u201cAre you sure this will work?\u201d I whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s so melodramatic.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019ll work,\u201d says Xiao Zhu, and as he pushes the button, he grins.\n A van slams through the opposite wall of the corridor, sending glass and masonry flying through the air. A brick lands on the horn, setting off a piercing wail. Lights flash and spin manically. Despite myself, I sniff. Melodramatic. The guard jumps up, shouts for someone, anyone, and rushes to inspect the damage. We run for the door, Lao Yang propped up between us, our footsteps camouflaged by the racket. We have about five seconds before he realizes there\u2019s no van after all.\n We stop for breath in a small park two streets over, flattening ourselves against the trees for cover. I hold onto Lao Yang as tightly as I dare. I don\u2019t believe what I said to him; reality is smog and shit and beatings, and you can\u2019t hit the switch on that. But when you\u2019re looking into the face of a broken man, what can you say? Beijing is a city of holograms, and that\u2019s reality. It\u2019s a city where you can get picked up off the street for no reason, and that\u2019s reality. But we got in and out. We rescued a friend. That\u2019s reality, too. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been that easy,\u201d I say. \u201cWe should have had to fight them.\u201d\n \u201cI wanted to fight them,\u201d says Xiao Zhu. \u201cAll those people in there, and that sobbing. We should have rescued them all.\u201d\n \u201cThat trick wasn\u2019t going to work twice,\u201d I say. \u201cWe did what we could. We fought until it was done.\u201d\n Xiao Zhu considers this, while the traffic roars past us and the holographic stars shine down. Then he turns to me, and the light in his eyes is brighter than them all.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a surprise for you.\u201d\n Two minutes later, with my heart in my mouth, I watch the hologram go down.\n The bright blue and yellow paint of the Ru Jia flickers, becomes faded and dull. Cracks appear in the plaster, windows become fractured and dusty, and the grass around its borders suddenly dies. For the first time in years, I see an eyesore on the streets of Beijing. And it stands out. It shouts its presence to the world. It makes me smile until I hurt.\n \u201cTomorrow morning, people are going to be asking questions about that,\u201d says Xiao Zhu. \u2019They\u2019ll probably even have a look at what goes on inside.\u201d\n Lao Yang lifts his head. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n \u201cI released a virus into their system, one that operates on a time delay. It\u2019s knocked out their projector and it\u2019ll block any attempt to fix it. I did it to cover our escape, but\u2014\u201d and he grins, helplessly, \u201cit has an upside, too.\u201d\n \u201cXiao Zhu,\u201d I say, \u201cI could kiss you. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\n It\u2019s funny. We spent three years picking away at the scab of history, but we never pulled it off until tonight. Twenty-eight courtyard houses are scattered throughout Beijing. They are beautiful, and they represent truth, but they never changed the world. All those roof beams, those delicate flowers, the tiles and the urns and the towers never did so much as hitting a switch and showing reality as it is. Our greatest triumph wasn\u2019t renewing the past, but exposing the future. And in a battle between the past, present and future, the future always wins.\n Sarah Stanton grew up in Perth, Western Australia.

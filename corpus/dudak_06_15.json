We vow to impose relativistic lockdown when a debt is owed to the universe, to deal out justice like a blind law of physics, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the vacuum!\u201d\nNuhane fights down the terror of open sky intrinsic to his branch of humanity. Although a spin foam hack keeps the atmosphere of this Titan-analog at bay, the shield is invisible. Stacked worlds of orange-glowing cloud present nauseating vistas. A darkling methane sea surrounds this rocky isle, this remote outpost of the Collection Bureau. Nuhane reminds himself that the oppressive distance to the horizon is not an existential threat. Still, he is of the Fey. He can\u2019t help longing for a nice underground bunker, a womb-cave, or the intimate companionways of a space hab.\nThe cadets march to the far end of the parade ground. Weird, brazen music issues from pipes attached to robotic air-bladders. It\u2019s all part of some ancient police ritual whose roots have been forgotten. Wisps of proxy tech haunt the margins of the field, proud instances of family and friends. Nuhane finds the scene rather grim. The intended effect is stark majesty, but he wants to get it over with, to join the fight he\u2019s been training for.\nHe has no people among the spectators, and none to speak of otherwise.\nFrom his childhood on a backward world, from concentration camps to this: lifetimes already, and he\u2019s only a hundred. He knows all too well what humanity is capable of. He can\u2019t fight for people alone, no matter how seemingly just the cause. In the Bureau he\u2019s found the only mission left to him.\nWithout the fabric of the cosmos, even hatred is impossible.\nHe wonders suddenly if he\u2019s remembering this moment, rather than living it. The future\u2014if there is such a thing\u2014comes to him like a divine revelation. It is a new past on the other side of \u201cnow,\u201d but he is powerless to act on the knowledge. He\u2019s locked inside this young cadet he once thought of as himself. The sensation is terrifying and glorious.\nSimultaneously, this passive observer inhabits many other Nuhanes, including a middle-aged Nuhane, a lieutenant radically interfaced with a Bureau patrol cutter.\nThe debtor\u2019s sign is plain to his augmented eye. The arcing spacetime fissure propagated like a magnetic field line from a gutted metal worldlet and out over the galactic plane. The nearest light-years of its length dissipate like an old contrail, undermining nearby vacuum. It is one of thousands of discernible violations. He sees them as an ominous glowing net tangled through the Milky Way, with stray threads arcing off to other galaxies and clusters. So much work to do. So much debt to collect.\nIf he tunes up his perception of the universal spin foam, he sees a second, thinner net woven through the first: debts collected, scars on spacetime. It sooths him to gaze upon all that the Bureau has accomplished. To him the scar tissue is a fundamental good, a rare thing in this universe. Never mind how little the tissue has done to shore up the collapsing seawall.\n\u201cFresh enough,\u201d says Lao Wang. \u201cBureau\u2019s giving it to us.\u201d The old baseline human sounds tired. Nuhane\u2019s mentor and partner has locked down thirty-one violators, collecting over ten million relativistic tons of debt, a Bureau record. Soon he\u2019ll vanish into lockdown himself, to pay off his Noble Debt. Nuhane will miss him. He wonders if this is their last mission together.\nA younger Nuhane imposes his first lockdown with a sense of dark wonder. The violator ship, a converted Shinasian junk, dims and reddens inside its pocket of pseudo-acceleration, a pulsating sphere of apparently warped spacetime.\nIt is Lao Wang\u2019s bust, but he let Nuhane do the honors\u2014a taste of imposition for the green junior officer.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d one of the debtors weeps. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this!\u201d The transmission redshifts as it climbs out of the pocket. \u201cI\u2019m a licensed interface pilot! I was forced into this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBy a violator called Phlogiston,\u201d Lao Wang supplies. \u201cI know, and I\u2019m afraid it makes no difference.\u201d\nThe pilot is in the Mayall II globular cluster of Andromeda much sooner than he should be. His mass contributed to the vacuum deterioration in the junk\u2019s wake, however minutely. He is therefore a debtor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Phlogiston\u2019s debt!\u201d the pilot argues. That name again. Nuhane wants to ask Lao Wang what\u2019s going on, but he\u2019s distracted by the spectacle of lockdown. He\u2019s seen it before, of course, but this one is different, no matter what the record will say. This one is his.\n\u201cPhlogiston\u2019s debt,\u201d Lao Wang says, \u201cand yours, and the junk\u2019s. Anything that violates, sentient or not, guilty or innocent, must be locked down. You\u2019re an interface pilot. You know what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\u201cBut the debt . . . \u201d he chokes.\n\u201cApproximately two million, seven hundred and forty-nine thousand, eight hundred and thirty-five point two two seven light-years.\u201d\n\u201cSo how long . . . \u201d\n\u201cTen minutes ship-time,\u201d Lao Wang says. \u201cFor your debt, lockdown is equivalent to point nine nine nine nine nine one seven c. Be thankful you won\u2019t suffer the gravities.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to add that meanwhile the resting universe will age 2.75 million years. This debtor is an interface-pilot, after all. He understands the law he has violated.\nThe junk continues to redshift, as though accelerating toward redemption. Soon it will be like a dim 3D snapshot printed on reality, beyond time and reproach. For 2.75 million years it will function like a head on London Bridge, a warning to those who would violate sacred law. Nuhane is proud to have finally contributed his first head. His pride waxes as the debtor\u2019s personal clocks slow. The ship will gain millions of relativistic tons before it pays its mass-energy debt to the universe. By the time it heals the rent it tore in spacetime, all that the pilot loves will be gone, or radically transformed.\nNuhane is drunk on the power he wields. Perhaps sensing this, Lao Wang says: \u201cNever forget that we are bound for the same fate.\u201d\nHow could he forget with Lao Wang constantly reminding him? You sooner than me, old man, he wants to say. Nuhane has accrued seventy million light-years of so-called Noble Debt or VLOD (Violation in the Line of Duty), certainly a small fraction of Lao Wang\u2019s. Nuhane is a young god, free to ignore Einstein when he sees fit, and to punish others for doing so. He worked hard to be so elite. Most Bureau officers end up with a local, sub-c jurisdiction, lying in wait for violators rather than hunting them. Their only taste of violation is the occasional use of a Bureau ansible. They are part of the vast, slow, relativistic two-thirds of humanity, trapped by distances that might as well be infinite.\nNuhane was never willing to settle for that. The last thing he wants to hear is Lao Wang urging him to humility.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t so different from our prey,\u201d the old man says.\nNuhane wonders if the bastard has developed violation syndrome. It\u2019s new, the idea that too much time beyond c can lead to symptoms of senility. Some researchers go further, claiming that violation decouples consciousness from time.\nMaster Patrol Officer Nuhane is still high from his last \u201cNoble\u201d violation. He\u2019s already looking forward to the next one. Between ecstasy and the grand future there is no room for doubt. Nuhane is immortal.\nBeyond c there is no time and no speed. Bureau officers call the speed of light the \u201clast speed.\u201d Here in violation space, all of Nuhane\u2019s violating selves are united. Beyond time there is exultant joy, infinite peace, and the \u201celdest\u201d of Nuhane\u2019s violation selves will find it hard to condescend back to the universe. They will leave pieces of themselves here.\nThe \u201cyounger\u201d Nuhanes fear the dissolution of self that must result from perfect bliss. They flee back below c, cherishing what little exultation they\u2019ve allowed themselves. All of the violating Nuhanes, young and old, remain in violation space for precisely the same amount of time\u2014none\u2014regardless of the light years skipped in the sub-c universe.\nAnd so, coincident with their unification, the united Nuhanes split along their seams of self. They become again old and young and middle-aged, returning to the sub-c murk once and for all.\nAs Major Nuhane condescends from violation space, emerging near a violator yacht in the Southern Local Supervoid, he wonders how he\u2019s going to explain this to the Bureau. They\u2019ll study his ansible. They\u2019ll suspect he tampered with its debt meter, but won\u2019t be able to prove it. What they\u2019ll be able to do is ground him with therapy sessions. Nuhane fears that more than anything.\nThe yacht winds up its violation ring, but Nuhane imposes lockdown before the ring completes its first test cycle.\nHe barely pays attention as the yacht wavers, begins to dim. His mind is still in violation space, in headlong discovery of joy. Why did he violate without permission? Was it really because of that informant at New McMurdo? The vacuum dweller had given him bad information before. Nuhane had vowed never to use her again. This time she claimed to know someone who knew Phlogiston, a violator no less, and she had coordinates for this violator\u2019s next jump.\nNuhane didn\u2019t hesitate. The informant was a known liar, her claim preposterous. Nuhane paid her. It was about a promise to Lao Wang, of course\u2014not an excuse to violate.\n\u201cOfficer,\u201d a female voice says.\nA video feed follows: twenty naked youths laze about in a garden setting, like an indolent pantheon of gods. Only one woman is standing, a sculpture in translucent flesh with inhuman black eyes and a cloud of silver hair. \u201cI won\u2019t insult your intelligence by denying our crime,\u201d she says. Most of her companions aren\u2019t even looking his way. Some appear to sleep.\n\u201cBig of you,\u201d Nuhane says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re with the Bureau. You have violated. You know how it feels.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSo you know why we do it.\u201d\nThey are libertines. They violated purely to experience violation space. Nuhane suspected this when the informant gave him the coordinates. The common breeds of violator\u2014colonists, shippers, transports\u2014have no reason to jump to an inter-filament void. Out here there is only vacuum and a novel view. The lights sprinkled across the blackness are all galaxies. In the varying density of this field, the large-scale structure of the universe is discernible.\nNuhane suffers a wave of nausea. Nowhere else is the universe\u2019s dumb magnitude more apparent. He allows his cutter to feed him a palliative. He longs for a cave, or the alchemy of violation space. Did Lao Wang ever yearn for it like this? Nuhane remembers a time, long before the old man\u2019s senility, when he seemed obsessed with violation, with its nature. But did he crave it? Perhaps all Bureau officers do.\n\u201cHow can you blame us for wanting that transcendence?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t deal in blame,\u201d Nuhane says. \u201cThink of me as a maintenance man.\u201d\nAn Apollo in the background chuckles, saying, \u201cThere it is.\u201d\nThe nymph at his side murmurs, \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\u201cI take it you don\u2019t believe in the danger of spacetime fissuring,\u201d Nuhane says.\nA ripple of laughter animates the pantheon. \u201cDo you?\u201d the translucent goddess asks.\nNuhane hates this old debate, but he wants to feel these people out. \u201cSet aside the overwhelming scientific consensus, if you like. Shouldn\u2019t we proceed with caution? It\u2019s the fabric of spacetime, after all. We need it.\u201d This elicits more laughter, and Nuhane gets angry despite himself\u2014angry at himself, more than these Deniers. He should be used to their kind. The age of unchecked FTL travel, the so-called Age of Innocence, left Deniers scattered across the cosmos. He has to remind himself of the Bureau\u2019s role: not to correct delusional thinking, not even to keep up with the damage, an impossibility. But to act as a deterrent. \u201cLaugh if you like,\u201d he says. \u201cLaugh all the way into lockdown.\u201d\n\u201cBureau fascist,\u201d the nymph says.\n\u201cYou want violation for yourselves,\u201d Apollo says. \u201cFirst rule of bureaucracy and so on. You imagine what humanity could be given by unchecked violation, and it terrifies you.\u201d\n\u201cYou hate freedom,\u201d says another woman.\nThey may have tweaked themselves to believe this drivel. Judging by their composure in the face of lockdown, they are no strangers to mental rewrites\u2014and their bodies are certainly customized. Not for the first time, Nuhane wonders what it would be like to see and think like a Denier. Driven by fear. Unable to live with the possibility, however remote, of the universe splitting along its fissures and flying apart. Choosing to believe otherwise.\nNuhane could go to a clinic, get the tweak. Then he could lose himself in violation. But the notion is fleeting. If he did that, he wouldn\u2019t enjoy the resulting fantasy. Someone new would.\n\u201cYou can still stop this lockdown,\u201d the translucent goddess says.\nThey haven\u2019t reached the point of no return, but they\u2019re close. Nuhane allows his cutter to underclock him to match their continually slowing reference frame. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re rich.\u201d\n\u201cCongratulations. I\u2019m after someone named Phlogiston.\u201d\nApollo and his nymph stop laughing. The rest of the pantheon subtly emerges from its contrived disinterest. This charged moment takes three months in Nuhane\u2019s resting universe.\nThe goddess says: \u201cThat\u2019s not his real name.\u201d\nNuhane is old, a commander, and the dwarf glares murkily just light-seconds away. The ominous substar seems familiar, or perhaps significant beyond its fearsome absurdity.\n\u201cSir?\u201d It\u2019s patrol officer Wen Ting, his junior partner. He can hear the concern mixed with youthful impatience in her voice. \u201cJump to orbit, or what?\u201d She knows violation syndrome has him by the throat. How could she not, by now? He remembers his own premonitions as Lao Wang deteriorated.\nThey have followed a ragged tear in spacetime to an abandoned long-range rig that only accounts for ninety-one percent of the debt. Something else launched from the rig and likely headed for the dwarf.\nInstead of giving the order Wen Ting craves, Nuhane contemplates the fissure. One of billions now. He gazes into the night and watches them in real time, no matter how far away they are, because they violate. They seem to propagate from him toward a distant haze woven through the microwave background.\n\u201cThe L-T object,\u201d Wen Ting prompts.\nNuhane returns his gaze to the dwarf, remembers they\u2019re here to lock down someone named Willard. The cutter doses him with the latest syndrome therapy. It activates random memories and loosens his tongue: \u201cPatrol Officer, did you know that my people were one of the first branches from baseline humanity? We were called fey because we bred ourselves small and claustrophilic for interstellar travel. And because our enterprise seemed like a death wish.\u201d\n\u201cFascinating, commander.\u201d\n\u201cWe were the first to colonize many worlds. We did it fair and square, no FTL. But on Lalo our civilization collapsed. When a wave of violators arrived, all that remained of us was an underground theocracy. Of course the violator civ also collapsed. They went medieval, demonized us, blamed us for crop failures, plagues, everything. Then they industrialized, declared total wars on each other. Most of our caverns were beneath a republic called Iomang, a desperate state ruled by a madman.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Wen Ting says absently, then adds, \u201cSomething\u2019s orbiting the dwarf.\u201d\nNuhane feels vaguely insulted. Hoping to embarrass her in turn, he asks, \u201cWhy did you join the Church of the Indemnity?\u201d\n\u201cWillard\u2019s shuttle is correcting toward the orbiter,\u201d she says, then seamlessly adds: \u201cMy people were violators. The Bureau wasn\u2019t going to let me in. Getting the Church tweak was the only way to prove my loyalty. At least, that\u2019s what I thought before. Now I see that this was the universe\u2019s way of guiding me toward the Faith.\u201d\nNuhane realizes she\u2019s explained this before. He ends up embarrassed for himself again. Furthermore, he finds nothing to mock in her story.\nWith a note of confusion Wen Ting announces: \u201cGrav harmonics from the orbiter, but not the signature of violation tech.\u201d She waits for Nuhane\u2019s order. Nuhane can\u2019t seem to focus. \u201cJump over and intercept before he can dock?\u201d she prods.\nWhen she initiates without consent, Nuhane realizes this mission will be his last.\nNuhane has been to several Bureau lockdown ceremonies, but Lao Wang\u2019s is the first to fill him with dread of the future. Captain Nuhane feels old for the first time in his life. He is on the observation deck of Achindoun, the Bureau hab that has long stood watch over the Nobly Locked Down. He\u2019s joined by fellow officers and a smattering of Lao Wang\u2019s proxied relations.\nLagrange point 4 of the Pluto-analog Kvichak and its moon Igiugig: here hang thousands of Bureau officers in their lockdown pods, most of them redshifted beyond casual observation. Lao Wang\u2019s has just shed its attitude jets, having found its place among the others.\nThe bagpipes sound, and the lensing of his pod signifies the beginning of lockdown. Some of his loved ones allow their proxies to broadcast sobs. Nuhane wonders what that says about the authenticity of their grief. He can only stare in numb transfixion.\nThe old man shoulders four hundred billion two hundred and eighty-seven thousand light-years of Noble Debt\u2014an epic career, but not the record. No one knows why people can only violate so many times before losing their faculties. Most officers don\u2019t break five hundred billion. Nuhane, now at ten billion four hundred and ninety million, wonders how far he\u2019ll go.\n\u201cReductio ad absurdum,\u201d Lao Wang PMs, \u201creductio ad infinitum. Redcutio ad absurdum, reductio . . . \u201d On he goes, repeating his nonsense mantra.\n\u201cListen Uncle,\u201d Nuhane says. \u201cWe both know I\u2019m not half the officer you are. I\u2019ll probably check out long before four hundred big ones. We could emerge from lockdown around the same time. We\u2019d be together, two old maniacs laughing at . . . whatever humanity is by then. How does that sound?\u201d\n\u201c . . . ad infinitum. Remember that, boy.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Nuhane is used to dealing with him like this. He\u2019s glad the old man had the sense to PM him, and not include his relatives.\n\u201cArchitectures, paradigms, we all fall down. Ashes, ashes.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cNuhane.\u201d His transmissions are redshifting fast now.\n\u201cI\u2019m here, Uncle.\u201d\n\u201cRemember that lockdown in Mayall II?\u201d\n\u201cMayall II . . . \u201d\n\u201cAndromeda.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I remember. The slaved pilot. We never found the perp.\u201d\n\u201cPhlogiston. He called himself Phlogiston. There was a file on him. You didn\u2019t rate the clearance at the time, so I couldn\u2019t tell you. He\u2019s important.\u201d\nNuhane doesn\u2019t know if this is the syndrome talking or not. \u201cI remember wondering what you were hiding. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll look at the file.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone. They even wiped it from me, somehow, whoever they are. But I know he was part of something big. I know it!\u201d\n\u201cI believe you,\u201d Nuhane says, not sure that he does.\n\u201cFind him. Violate off the books if you have to. Promise me.\u201d\nNuhane is sure that his other, timeless self is here, reading his life like prose. The more he violates, the more certain he is of this.\nNuhane\u2019s counselor is Lectern, an instance of a Turing-passable expert system, an ancient Bureau creature possessed of unfathomable secrets. Colonel Nuhane is enduring another therapy session. All he can think about is getting back into violation space, which is the sort of thing Lectern would like to know, and the last thing Nuhane cares to admit.\n\u201cWe were talking about your old partner,\u201d the system prods. \u201cHis lockdown ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a hundred years ago,\u201d Nuhane prevaricates.\n\u201cThen let\u2019s talk about your debriefing last week,\u201d Lectern suggests.\n\u201cAn instance of you was there. Surely you\u2019ve reintegrated by now.\u201d\n\u201cHow did the questions make you feel?\u201d\n\u201cAngry.\u201d\n\u201cYou violated without authorization. Shouldn\u2019t we be concerned?\u201d\n\u201cFor the last time, my ansible went into lockdown before I could request the jump. I was chasing a lead. I made a judgment call.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s evidence that you tampered with your ansible. Its debt meter was dialed up.\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, it must\u2019ve been faulty!\u201d\n\u201cWhich isn\u2019t supposed to be possible. But Bureau legend has it that Lao Wang knew how.\u201d\n\u201cHe taught me a lot of things, but never that.\u201d Nuhane is barely able to convince himself that this charade is about keeping his promise to Lao Wang, and not about hiding his addiction. The old man wasn\u2019t clear, but he seemed to imply that someone inside the Bureau was working with Phlogiston. Nuhane doubts that Lectern is involved, but can\u2019t be sure.\n\u201cThis lead you explained to the board . . . \u201d\nHow much longer can he juggle the lies? In addition to the board inquiries, he has a new partner to deal with. She is from the Church of the Indemnity, tweaked to take an almost feline pleasure in the hunt. She wants to inflict lockdowns. She won\u2019t tolerate a prolonged investigation full of dead ends.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a fabrication,\u201d Lectern continues. \u201cIf you\u2019re investigating something off the books, you\u2019d better come clean to the board. Regardless, we need to face the fact of your addiction.\u201d Nuhane waits for the system to take a different tack. \u201cNot today? Then how about your childhood on Lalo-honua? Are you ready to go there yet?\u201d\nNuhane restrains his irritation. He has always avoided this topic, but for the first time it seems preferable to everything else on the docket. \u201cThe bliss of violation space,\u201d he says, \u201cis like confronting infinity. It\u2019s like the most wide open space possible, without fear. For me anyway.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Lectern says. \u201cThere have been two other Fey officers before you. They both said the same thing.\u201d\nThis brings Nuhane an odd sense of comfort. He is encouraged to go deeper: \u201cI remember the explosions that opened up the Hall of Star Ancestors. The Iomangans were clever. The sunlight disoriented us.\u201d\n\u201cDisoriented you. Focus on your personal experiences.\u201d\n\u201cI was too young to understand. I thought the Iomangans were monsters. That\u2019s what our priests taught. All I knew was that our world was falling down around us. Many were killed in the collapse.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw that?\u201d\n\u201cI saw my father buried. Annihilated in moments. Also my great-great-grandmother, and many cousins.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cThen there were these giants. I\u2019d never seen them before. They had fire magic, in addition to swords. They killed many, including my grandmothers, before a commander showed up and ordered them to stop. The rest of us were herded to the surface. Up there we were helpless with our phobias, all but blind. I was separated from my mother. They packed us into magic boxes that moved on metal tracks. Many more of us died in those, suffocated or starved. You could say I was lucky, having been packed against one of my great aunts. She opened a vein and fed me her blood. I slowly killed her in order to survive.\u201d\n\u201cNo. That wasn\u2019t murder.\u201d\nNuhane ignores this laughable claim. \u201cAnd then there were the camps. We children learned how to hide and steal and survive. The adults fell into torpors and died, if they weren\u2019t killed outright. There were medical experiments, you see. And labor they knew we couldn\u2019t sustain. And random sport killings. I know what you\u2019re thinking, Lectern. Don\u2019t worry. I saw these things myself. All of them and more.\u201d\nNuhane watches the universe blue-shift around him, knowing he is old, that this is his Noble Lockdown\u2014but sure of little else.\nPseudo acceleration. But no pseudo equivalence principle. He doesn\u2019t feel the gravities. How could he? He\u2019s not going anywhere, not in space anyway.\nHow did he get here? What was his last mission? He had another partner after Lao Wang. What was her name?\nHis timeless observing other cannot enlighten him. The other wonders, as always, why he knows nothing beyond this lockdown. Does Nuhane die soon? Is it some effect of terminal violation syndrome? An immanent cure? Or is something catastrophic about to happen to time itself? Perhaps scientists underestimated the deleterious effect of violation. Perhaps spacetime is about to unravel.\nWhatever the reason, the timeless other knows he is soon to be no more.\nColonel Nuhane kneels with the other initiates before the torch-lit altar. Beyond is enshrined a fierce-looking idol, a Taoist god with bulging, hungry eyes. An urgent drum makes the incense-laden air pulse.\nNuhane endures the ritual like he did his Bureau passing-out. He ought to be happier to be in a nice cave like this.\n\u201cEight hundred years ago,\u201d declaims a red-robed man, \u201cthe emperor Kangxi consigned many Shaolin monks to fiery death. Five survivors escaped to a mountaintop temple, before which, using grass for incense, they formed a sacred brotherhood. They vowed revenge, pledging to oppose the Qing dynasty and restore the Ming.\u201d\n\u201cFan qing fu ming!\u201d the initiates affirm. Oppose the Qing and restore the Ming.\n\u201cAt the Red Flower Pavilion, the Five founded the Hong Society. The Hong conducted heroic but doomed uprisings. One hundred thousand Hong soldiers sacrificed themselves courageously for the Han race.\u201d The man is a good actor. He appears stern and proud. Nuhane has no idea whether or not he\u2019s actually Han\u2014not that it matters. \u201cAnd the Hong society continues to thrive today!\u201d\nAfter a sufficient dramatic pause, he adds, \u201cBegin the ceremony!\u201d\nSenior brethren in black robes and red sashes enter the cave. One by one they\u2019re stopped by two guards, who cross their broadswords and shout, \u201cYou are entering the Hong army fortress! Disobedience is punishable by death!\u201d The black-robes reply with, \u201cI am a Ming general! I build bridges and roads!\u201d or \u201cI cross mountains and ramparts! Don\u2019t you recognize a brother?\u201d And they\u2019re allowed to pass.\nThe stuff about bridges and crossings is uncanny. Nuhane wonders if the ancient Ming rebels had the gift of foresight. This secret society has had nothing to do with Ming restoration since the 20th century, possibly earlier. They devolved into gangsterism, eventually becoming the most powerful hei she hui on old Terra. When the communist party collapsed, they took over China. Two hundred years later, their sole passion was traveling faster than light.\nBridges and roads indeed.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d the red-robe barks at Nuhane.\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to enlist,\u201d he replies.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cTo oppose the Qing and restore the Ming!\u201d\n\u201cProve it!\u201d\nFollowing the ritual to the letter, Nuhane recites a poem:\n\u201cDraw broadswords,\nthe Manchurians stole our land!\nThe hour of loyalty\nand blood vengeance is at hand!\u201d\nWith that the red-robe moves on, challenging other initiates. They are as varied as Nuhane\u2019s cadet class at the Bureau. This Heaven and Earth Society has not been Chinese, let alone Han, for a very long time.\nNext comes a black-robe, slapping each initiate in the back with the flat of a broadsword, then demanding: \u201cDo you love gold or your brethren?\u201d\nThe initiates each reply, \u201cMy brethren!\u201d in their turn. Nuhane struggles not to faint after the blow nearly shatters his tiny frame.\nAll this for one unauthorized violation. Nuhane was indignant when the Bureau followed his therapy with undercover duty. Since then he has grown numb, having weathered violation withdrawal. Infiltrating the Heaven and Earth Society has been a kind of sleepwalk.\nSometimes he can\u2019t help wishing that these gangsters would steal a Bureau cutter. He could claim to know how to hack the interface nest, then violate. Where to? Would it matter? He would continue to honor his promise to Lao Wang, of course. It wouldn\u2019t be about the violation alone. He isn\u2019t like that anymore. He hasn\u2019t violated in three years. Not that he\u2019s had the chance.\n\u201cThe first oath!\u201d the red-robe shouts. \u201cOnce a member of the society, I shall treat the relatives of my brethren as my own. If I don\u2019t keep this oath, I shall be struck down by five thunderbolts!\u201d\nThe initiates repeat this. Nuhane finds that he is tired of oaths. To the Bureau, to mentors and gangsters and spacetime, and most of all to himself. He remembers being free of promises in violation space.\nPatrol Officer Nuhane and Lieutenant Lao Wang have followed a debtor\u2019s spacetime fissure from the Small Magellanic Cloud to this system in the heart of the Pavo-Indus Supercluster. Lao Wang locked the violator down before it could fall into the orbit of a world originally terraformed by other violators. The verdant, uninhabited globe hangs in the void, a jewel that shouldn\u2019t exist. The people that sparked the terraforming drift in an old, barely discernible mist of lockdown pockets at the planet\u2019s L2 point.\nThe violator ship, locked down only moments ago, blushes slightly. It\u2019s a large cargo vessel, no doubt a second wave of colonists. Their debt stands at three hundred million light-years. They will pay off four hundred and twenty thousand relativistic tons. Young Nuhane still marvels at the weight of these crimes, and the price of getting caught.\nHe and Lao Wang, though interfaced in separate nests, share an environ that renders their facial expressions. Lao Wang wears an odd grin. He pings the cargo vessel and says, \u201cExcuse me. Do you know how fast you were going?\u201d\nWhen there is no response, he shrugs and says to Nuhane: \u201cA joke. Old reference.\u201d He avoids Nuhane\u2019s bewildered gaze. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have come back,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Nuhane says.\n\u201cI mean, maybe we\u2019re not meant to return from violation space. Maybe we\u2019re supposed to break light speed and stay beyond it, forever.\u201d He meets Nuhane\u2019s eyes again, summons an unconvincing chuckle. \u201cNever mind. Guess I need some R and R. You won\u2019t report what I just said, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo sir.\u201d\nThey watch the violator fade. Nuhane contemplates the mystery of violation and lockdown. Already the cargo vessel\u2019s spacetime fissure is beginning to heal, even back in the Small Magellanic. True action at a distance, a violation of c in its own right.\nNuhane can\u2019t believe what he sees in the soul of the man his fellow thugs just killed. The ice ceiling scrolls by the window, and the dead man, formerly a violation savant for the Heaven and Earth Society, slides back and forth across the floor with the motion of the hab, his head encased in a smoking transmigration helmet.\nNuhane hides his excitement. He has found his ticket off this nightmarish detail. He will be violating again soon\u2014but it\u2019s more than that.\nThe helmet sends pertinent memories to Nuhane\u2019s mirror net. His rhythms sift through the complexity of violation math, seeking names and itineraries. He needed something underway, something he could lock down, but he didn\u2019t expect to find it. It was clear right away that the man hadn\u2019t spoken with the Bureau. Perhaps he never intended to. The Heaven and Earth kingpin of this Europa-analog has grown paranoid in his dotage, violation syndrome having burned wormholes through his reason.\n\u201cYou said he didn\u2019t rat,\u201d says Plutarch, a hulking gangster eight times the size of Nuhane. \u201cSo why are we still here? If he\u2019s so interesting, grab the helmet. But let\u2019s go.\u201d\nNuhane does not want to decapitate the savant. The crystalline mass that was once his head is permanently merged with the helmet. Nuhane has done many things for Heaven and Earth, things far worse than decapitating a corpse, but he feels he has reached a critical mass.\nHe just needs another minute to confirm what he saw: a very improbable name.\nOutside, the hab lights flash on particles suspended in the inky water. The media wall maps the local ice ceiling and the other habs as they converge on a stable rendezvous point to form yet another temporary city. That\u2019s how society works here in Baroque Pearl. Nuhane tried to convince himself he liked it, at first. It was a sub-surface existence. His sordid duties for Heaven and Earth were part of the mission, just as important as locking down violators. He didn\u2019t miss violating. So went the flimsy monologue.\nHe confirms the name attached to the violation-in-progress: William Valentin Willard, aka Phlogiston. He smiles.\nNuhane is eleven years old, and feels much older, when the harriers drop from the sky to liberate his camp. He clutches the chain-link fence and watches the Iomangan guards flee across the heath under a leaden sky. One by one the giants vanish as plasma rains down. Nuhane tries to feel glad, to feel anything in fact, and fails. He has learned many things in this camp. He has learned to tolerate the open sky, beneath which he has learned what humans really are. He knows that the Iomangans are descendants of violators, and that his liberators are also violators. He does not know what that means.\nWhat he finally feels is dread. He\u2019s going to have to leave the camp, and enter a wider world.\nThree hundred and fifty billion light-years.\nHe often wondered how far he would go before succumbing to violation syndrome\u2014and now he knows. Three fifty is nothing to be ashamed of. It\u2019s not the stuff of legend, but it\u2019s respectable. At least he knows he has the syndrome. He tells himself that\u2019s something. Perhaps it means he\u2019s not so far gone.\nIt was these last two violations that did it. He knows that on a level below the cellular.\n\u201cShall I lock him down?\u201d Wen Ting asks. She floats with him in the new cutter\u2019s sensorium, wide-eyed with the thrill of the hunt. Nuhane envies her youth, her cold pure hunter\u2019s psychopathy, though he doesn\u2019t fully understand it. The Church of the Indemnity has wired her up good. When she locked down that last rig, she curled into a fetal position, moaning with something beyond divine communion. \u201cCommander?\u201d she says.\nHe\u2019s forgotten why they\u2019re here, and it terrifies him. He blinks up the dossier of their current mark: William Valentin Willard, aka Phlogiston, quantum information physicist and outspoken Bureau sympathizer. Trillions of humans call him a Bureau lapdog and want him dead. He understands that the Bureau holds the universe together, understands it in a way that Wen Ting and her brethren never will. He doesn\u2019t need their leap of faith. He invented the machine that images the universe\u2019s scars.\n\u201cViolating c,\u201d he said famously, \u201cis worse than murder.\u201d\nAnd yet here he is, after a serious galaxy hop. What possessed him?\nHis shuttle falls toward Nuhane\u2019s cutter. Beneath them hangs the mysterious machine, alive with its puzzling gravitational waves. None of Nuhane\u2019s scans or Wen Ting\u2019s mystic sensing find weapons in the fine-woven ring of exotic matter. Far below it, dark storms roil over the surface of the dim red L-T dwarf. Nuhane wonders what role, if any, Willard means this substar to play in whatever he\u2019s up to.\n\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Willard transmits. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d\nWith his voice comes the visual of a surprisingly youthful man: middle aged, gray-bearded but healthy and vital. For a moment Nuhane can\u2019t reconcile this with what he knows. Willard ought to be decrepit by now, even if he\u2019s had longevity treatments. Then Nuhane remembers that Willard has traveled relativistically. The man has lived a decade or so of the last five hundred years.\nWen Ting shows him a scan of the orbiting machine. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nHis brief grin is barely perceptible. \u201cAh, one of the Bureau\u2019s pet zealots.\u201d He understands\u2014or understood\u2014that the Bureau needs all the support it can get, even if that means employing delusional jihadists.\nWhat has become of the far-seeing creature Willard used to be?\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d he says.\nWen Ting scans the orbital machine again, hoping this time the Angels of Indemnity will grant revelation. It appears conclusive that the thing is not a weapon. There are signs of a spin foam hack about it, but the configuration is wrong for violation or lockdown tech.\n\u201cDo you need me to confess?\u201d Willard says impatiently.\nNuhane wonders if the man craves the portal to the future that lockdown represents. Perhaps he has grown weary of his small-minded contemporaries. Then why not take off at relativistic speed, like he has before?\nNuhane hesitates to impose lockdown. He may be slipping into dotage, but he senses he\u2019s being manipulated.\nWen Ting, however, does not hesitate. She and the cutter have developed an understanding in the face of Nuhane\u2019s decline. She doesn\u2019t need his authorization. She imposes with relish.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Willard says, as yet barely redshifted.\nNuhane feels Wen Ting\u2019s confusion through her bio feed. Violators aren\u2019t supposed to be thankful. They\u2019re supposed to beg for mercy. But Willard is no masochist. Nuhane also feels the grav waves from the orbiter changing tune, and knows something fundamental is happening to local spacetime. He perceives a disturbance, much like the fractures caused by violation, blossoming between Willard\u2019s shuttle, the orbiter, and the dwarf below. A lockdown pocket encloses the orbiter, seeming to mirror Willard\u2019s.\nWen Ting panics. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have led you so far,\u201d Willard replies, \u201cbut I needed at least a seventy million light-year debt for this trial run.\u201d\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\u201cMy machine is crude. The first of its kind. It won\u2019t respond to anything less than a seventy mil debt.\u201d\nThis transmission arrives at an unchanging radio wavelength. Willard\u2019s redshifting has ceased. This is stunning, unprecedented, but Nuhane\u2019s attention is drawn to the machine, now shivering and glowing under some unfathomable workload. Nuhane senses that it is channeling something\u2014Hilbert distortion? inertia?\u2014from Willard\u2019s shuttle down into the murky furnace of the dwarf.\n\u201cI approached the Bureau first,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t believe me. Or didn\u2019t want to. They tried to kill me, you know. Maybe you won\u2019t believe that, but it\u2019s true. So I had to go to Heaven and Earth. It is regrettable that the savant in Baroque Pearl had to die, but I needed you to believe that lead and come after me. I should also apologize for having Lao Wang wiped. Canny, that one. He was on to me before I was ready. And it was my man in the Bureau who got you assigned to that duty in Baroque Pearl. I don\u2019t imagine it was pleasant. All for a greater good, as you\u2019ll see.\u201d\nFar below, a darkness blossoms between two ribbons of turbulent black cloud. One might almost take it for another storm of raining iron, but for the speed of its formation. It expands like an ink stain through the hydrogen blood-glow, devouring thousands of cubic kilometers per second. Nuhane remembers that the dwarf was already radiating in the long visible wavelengths, that lockdown of such matter would mean swift blackness. He tunes his vision and watches the still-growing lockdown pocket\u2014the largest one ever, as far as he knows\u2014dimming down its trapped matter through infrared and radio. The pocket soon encloses a fifth of the substar, and keeps expanding. Great storms flash and gleam along the moving perimeter, and the Jupiter-like band-flow is thrown into chaos.\n\u201cDebt transfer,\u201d Nuhane says. The words are packed with mythic weight.\n\u201cImpossible,\u201d Wen Ting declares.\n\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d Willard says, \u201cbut something\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nOver one third of the dwarf is now enclosed, the remainder stirred to frenzy by the process and made to radiate like the accretion disk of a black hole. The lockdown pocket behaves like a collapsed star in many ways, though it has no real event horizon. As the brighter material is swallowed, Nuhane can judge how far along the lockdown is, what fraction of c it is equivalent to. The hottest free matter radiates in the extreme ultraviolet to soft X-ray range, but attenuates after falling in. And still the pocket grows.\n\u201cMy shuttle and I weigh about seven tons,\u201d Willard says. His self-satisfaction is gone, replaced by mounting horror. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve discovered a new law of physics. The Law of the Transfer Fee.\u201d\nNuhane gets there just after him, he is sure they\u2019re wondering the same thing now: how much of a fee?\nUnlike a black hole, a lockdown pocket doesn\u2019t exert gravity, so the remaining dwarf material\u2014plasmas of hydrogen and helium, trace metals and silicates\u2014overcomes its own gravitation and shreds away wildly into space.\nIt doesn\u2019t occur to Nuhane to get out of the way, not until he sees Willard and his machine doing so. Wen Ting reacts first, matching Willard\u2019s escape vector, worlds of fire blooming under them. The pocket swells and consumes, but slower than before.\nWen Ting is chanting again. Occasionally she forgets a phrase or a line and has to start over. Nuhane scans her mind and sees that her Church mod is short-circuiting, overloaded with a cumbersome truth.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to help me,\u201d Willard says.\nThe pocket finally stops expanding, content with the mass of forty-five Jupiters. The remaining one-fourth of the dwarf continues to burn and diffuse into space. The holy grail of debt transfer is possible, but hideously expensive. The transfer fee in this case was 1.2 octillion percent of the debt.\nNuhane scans Willard and confirms he is debt free. The machine seems to be powering down. Wen Ting is curled in a fetal position again, this time with excruciating pain. She shivers, sweating and whimpering with Church withdrawal.\n\u201cI\u2019ve violated but can\u2019t be locked down,\u201d Willard says. \u201cSo arrest me. Take me to a hub.\u201d\nNuhane understands. Willard\u2019s shuttle can\u2019t achieve relativistic speeds, let alone violate. There is no concentrated source of matter for light-years around, so he can\u2019t get his long-range rig out of lockdown. He\u2019s at Nuhane\u2019s mercy.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just you and your partner and that savant,\u201d he admits. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it. Maybe I deserve to die out here, but it can\u2019t all be for nothing.\u201d With that, his shuttle lights up with high-power transmissions aimed at a few hundred of the nearest inhabited systems and galaxies. Nuhane takes a sample: the machine specs and documentation of what happened to the dwarf.\n\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Nuhane says.\n\u201cFreed humanity.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a good thing, is it? Perhaps we need a cage.\u201d Before it\u2019s out of his mouth, he wonders if his heritage, or the Bureau, speaks through him. Maybe it\u2019s neither. Maybe it\u2019s the boy who got used to a concentration camp, and hated himself for it.\nHe turns his attention to Wen Ting, tweaking her neurochemistry to ease the trauma of her disillusionment. He marvels at the delicacy of her Church tweak, but something so absurd could be no other way\u2014not without undermining her basic functionality.\n\u201cDebtor,\u201d she whispers, \u201cmake satisfaction for thy sin.\u201d\nNuhane tries to imagine what will become of the debt transfer universe. Matter will soon be at a premium, if he knows anything about mankind. Then what? Cycles of lockdown and emergence? Relativistic dark ages followed by renaissances of violation? Perhaps the stars must wink out, one by one, to become readily accessible. What about expansion, deprived of all that gravitating matter? What about dark matter and energy? Are lockdowns that vast even possible?\nThe Bureau as Nuhane knows it will be obsolete, regardless. Perhaps it will be relegated to catalyzing debt transfer, facilitating the violations it once policed. That would still be holding the universe together. That would still be his mission, wouldn\u2019t it?\nNuhane is four years old when his parents take him to the Hall of Star Ancestors for the first time. The cavern is the biggest space he\u2019s ever seen.\nBut not the biggest you\u2019ll ever see, says the man in his skull.\nNuhane gapes at the distant ceiling. It is a field of lights that his people call stars. \u201cThey\u2019re actually colonies of bioluminescent fungus,\u201d Father says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t teach him blasphemies,\u201d Mother whispers. The vast space is relatively quiet as hundreds of people walk the Great Circle and show proper awe.\nHis people are the Fey. Mother says they came from the stars.\nSomeday you\u2019ll travel to the real stars, the man in his skull says, but Nuhane doesn\u2019t believe him. You\u2019ll forget about me for a long time, then remember me again. But we won\u2019t be able to talk like this anymore.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nuhane asks aloud, and Mother shushes him.\n\u201cLeave him be,\u201d Father says.\n\u201cAnd let him anger the priests?\u201d Mother hisses. \u201cAnd get us sent to the sulfur farms?\u201d She looks up at the fake stars. \u201cAncestors, why did you curse me with such a husband?\u201d\nNuhane\u2019s parents always quarrel when he talks to the man in his skull. Father says it\u2019s a gift, a sign he\u2019s destined for great things. It was Father who named him Nuhane, which in some ancient language means speaker with the ghosts of ancestors.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

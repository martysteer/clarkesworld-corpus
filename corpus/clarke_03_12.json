Lily Yu and Catherynne M. Valente for their respective Nebula Award nominations for Best Short Story and Best Novella. We\u2019re quite pleased to see \u201cThe Cartographer Wasps and the Anarchist Bees\u201d and \u201cSilently and Very Fast\u201d on the ballot. Good luck! We\u2019ll be rooting for both of you!\n A word of advice to our book collector friends: the signed limited edition of \u201cSilently and Very Fast\u201d that was published by WSFA Press is nearly out of print. You might want to grab one while you can.\n In other good news, thanks to the continued growth of our Kindle and Weightless Books e-subscriptions, we will be rolling out some more non-fiction features over the next few months. The first of these is scheduled to debut in our April issue. If you\u2019d like to see Clarkesworld continue to grow, please help us spread the word about our subscription options. Details can be found at clarkesworldmagazine.com/subscribe/.\n Thanks, as always, for your continued support!\n Neil Clarke is the editor of Clarkesworld Magazine and Forever Magazine; owner of Wyrm Publishing; and a ten-time Hugo Award Nominee for Best Editor (short form).

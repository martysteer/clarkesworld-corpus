Her stories are bumping up closer to ten thousand. Not much else has changed. Her work remains relentlessly unpredictable, and simultaneously forward-looking and retro-flective.\nIt\u2019s been easiest for critics, reviewers, and fans to label Cadigan a cyberpunk writer and then offer a variety of caveats. Indeed, she has written and continues to write about the many and varied intersections of technology and biology, but once you try to put Cadigan in a category you rapidly find more exceptions to than confirmations of the rule.\nCadigan is driven to write.\n\u201cThe same thing that compels me to live [compels me to write],\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what I do, and I\u2019m always doing it, even if I\u2019m not at the keyboard.\u201d\nThere is often an undercurrent of dark humor and the looming shadow of dark past in her fiction; occasionally there\u2019s even nagging feeling that someone is pulling one over on you while also being deadly serious.\nCadigan can dodge any bullet the future fires at humankind, it seems. She speculates around corners and sees into the shadows of even the darkest possibilities. Her vision of tomorrow is kaleidoscopic.\nAuthor of the novels Mindplayers, Synners, and Fools, as well as numerous stories and novellas, Cadigan has been nominated numerous times for the Hugo but it wasn\u2019t until this year that she finally won the award, along with the Locus Award for the novelette \u201cThe Girl-Thing Who Went Out for Sushi.\u201d Orbiting Jupiter, humans opt to surgical modify themselves to be like marine lifeforms such as octopuses. She recently released a holiday story, \u201cThe Christmas Show.\u201d Additionally, \u201cChalk,\u201d tells a story of two friends who a private place to be creative away from the prying eyes of adults only to discover magic.\nWhat do these stories all have common beyond their author? They\u2019re all different.\nIs there ever a limit to the \u201cexciting possibilities and dangerously unpredictable\u201d aspects of writing?\nThe only limits are those the writer sets, either consciously or unconsciously. I am primarily a fiction writer but twenty years ago, I ran away with a carnival sideshow so I could write an article about it for Omni magazine. Well, I didn\u2019t really run away. I had been GOH at a convention in Calgary, Alberta, and they brought in Scott McClelland\u2019s Carnival Diablo to perform. It was wonderful. After the performance, I got to know Scott and the other performer Ryan Madden and we kept in touch.\nLater that year, the sideshow had some dates to play in British Columbia and I decided that it would make a great article. So I pitched it to then-editor-in-chief Keith Ferrell, who gave me the go-ahead and I traveled with Scott and Ryan and Julianne Manchur who had joined the show. It was a total departure for me. Travelling through the Canadian Rockies in a van in December can be exhilarating but it can also be scary. I remember when we drove through a cloud\u2014we were high up and the clouds were that low. I\u2019d thought it would be like driving through a patch of fog but it was decidedly different. It wasn\u2019t an easy trip but I\u2019d do it again in a heartbeat.\nI\u2019ve since written two nonfiction books\u2014I lucked into an assignment to write the book about the making of the Lost In Space movie in 1997 and I was able to write it because I\u2019d learned how to write nonfiction with Carnival Diablo. The next year, Universal re-made The Mummy and I was lucky enough to write the making-of book for that one, too. After the book came out, Mike Resnick told me I had done a very good job. I felt like I\u2019d gotten an Olympic medal; Mike has traveled extensively in Africa and has forgotten more about Egypt than I\u2019ll ever learn.\nAnd just FYI: I was in my mid-to-late forties when I took on those making-of assignments. You don\u2019t have to be a young person to try something new.\nAre there any stories in which you feel as though you got it \u201cwrong\u201d or took a misstep? And, conversely, what are some of the stories that helped you turn corners or take leaps forward? And why?\nWell, I had to make a late correction in the galleys of my first novel, Mindplayers. When I started the novel, there was no way to signal someone who was in the middle of REM sleep, to tell them they were dreaming, without waking them up. By the time I turned the novel in, a method had been developed to do that, so a person could receive a low-level stimulus to tell them they were dreaming, so they could dream lucidly\u2014i.e., they know they\u2019re dreaming and they take charge of the action. I had to change that part of the novel in which I stated it wasn\u2019t possible.\nConversely, Synners isn\u2019t as science-fictional as it used to be. Some of the technology is now possible. The technology that isn\u2019t possible has not been proved to be impossible yet.\nWhat are you working on now?\nI\u2019m working on the novel based on/inspired by/taking off from \u201cThe Girl-Thing Who Went Out For Sushi,\u201d working title: See You When You Get There. I also have several other novels simmering on the back-burner as well.\nWithout getting into content, how are you moving from \u201cThe Girl-Thing\u201d to See You When? Are you adding on, launching off, what?\n\u201cGirl-Thing\u201d will not be part of the novel, which occurs a few hundred years after.\nHow has it challenged you so far?\nI\u2019ve had to learn even more nuts-and-bolts about the solar system, interplanetary travel, habitats in space, and all kinds of other stuff I won\u2019t go into right now because I don\u2019t want to spoil the surprise.\nHow much of what you do just happens and how much is planned out beforehand?\nThat depends on what I\u2019m working on. Sometimes an idea arrives whole; other times I have to write my way through it and keep slogging. When I work at novel-length, I always have a roadmap\u2014I know where I\u2019m starting out from and where I want to go, and I know the major milestones I\u2019ll hit in between. But it\u2019s not so mapped out that there won\u2019t be surprises. I like to leave room for spontaneous combustion/generation, not to mention the occasional detour/side-trip/scenic overlook.\nYou\u2019ve been doing this now for a good while, has your process changed much? If so, how?\nI\u2019ve been a professional writer for thirty-four years; for the first thirty-three, I simply wrote whenever, however I could. These days, I lounge on the sofa with my iPad and my Bluetooth keyboard, often with the cat curled up on my lap and music playing. I start early in the morning and go until I\u2019m dry. At some point in the late afternoon, I put on the TV, even if I\u2019m still working. As the quintessential American teenager, I did all my homework in front of the TV and I still do.\nAfter years of having built in time limits and restraints, responsibilities as a caregiver, how do you keep from just . . . you know, watching the TV without doing the writing?\nAll these years, I haven\u2019t been making time to watch TV, I\u2019ve been making time so I can write. I\u2019m never not connected to my writing. That\u2019s just how it works for me.\nIs there a part of a story, long or short, that tends to give you the most difficulty?\nYes. There are difficulties inherent in every part of a story. Which will give me the most trouble depends on the story. They\u2019re all different. It just depends on the story.\nDo you feel more at home in the short form or the long form?\nFor the last ten years, I\u2019ve been writing short fiction because caring for my elderly mother was so demanding it was impossible to find enough time and space to think at novel-length. She passed away just before Christmas in 2012 and now I\u2019m able to plan novels again.\nThe short story is my first love because that\u2019s where I started out. Well, technically, the novelette, according to SFWA word-counts. Back when I was working a full-time day job (and looking after a new baby), I could do anything in five thousand words or less. It was all I had time for. My first novel was actually a fix-up of a few novelettes and a short story, with added interstitial material\u2014Shawna McCarthy, who was at Bantam then, had read the stories and thought they\u2019d make a good book. My second novel, Synners, was actually the first novel I wrote from beginning to end without any pre-existing material (it sort of jumped off from my short story \u201cRock On,\u201d but the story wasn\u2019t part of the novel).\nSince then, I\u2019ve been wordier\u2014my shortest fiction seldom runs much below eight thousand words, and it\u2019s usually closer to ten thousand words even after rigorous cutting. Ellen Datlow taught me how to trim the fat and kill my darlings. (Although I don\u2019t really kill them\u2014I cut them and put them in an out-takes file. That way I can have my cake and eat it, too.)\nGenerally, the story, whatever it may be, tells me whether it\u2019s the start of a novel or a stand-alone piece of short fiction.\nHow do you KNOW?\nThat\u2019s one I can\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know how I know. I recognize it when I see it.\n\u201cThe Girl-Thing Who Went Out For Sushi,\u201d which won a Hugo in 2013, (please pardon my immodesty for bragging), was meant to be a one-off. It was only after it came out\u2014in Edge of Infinity, edited by Jonathan Strahan\u2014that I consciously began thinking about a novel.\nI was definitely working outside my comfort zone with \u201cGirl-Thing.\u201d I had never written this kind of story before and I had to do a lot of research to get all the nuts-and-bolts right. It was hard but it was also great fun figuring out what the characters could and couldn\u2019t do, what could and couldn\u2019t happen. These things are not a matter of opinion and I knew I had to be really careful because, as I have pointed out elsewhere many times in the past, science fiction readers are smart. If you don\u2019t know the difference between centripetal force and centrifugal force, if you don\u2019t know the difference between weight and mass, if you don\u2019t know how things like angular momentum, orbital resonance, and gravity boosts work, you\u2019ll look like a moron. The readers will tell you and you\u2019ll feel like a moron.\nAnd incidentally, now I\u2019m sixty. You\u2019re never too old to try something different or learn something new.\nJeremy L. C.

The late-autumn birches shed bright leaves. Occasionally, birch bark crackles beneath young trampling feet.\nA long procession emerges from the sunset glow, drawing near. An elderly couple steps out of the ranks, each holding on to a tiny hand.\nThey stand and watch the women in sackcloth pass by. The women keen and wail, the performance so exaggerated I have a hard time believing they mourn relatives or friends. They seem more like the hired wailers of olden times. The suona horn players follow, blowing a funeral dirge, but they don\u2019t seem all that sorrowful. A youngster\u2019s mouth curls in an absentminded grin, his thoughts far away. All of this together is fantastical, a scene composed of disparate elements that could drift apart at any moment.\nThe subject tells me the scene is from the 1990s, and a little-known corner of the North China Plain.\nSmall three-story houses of yellow clay and black roof tile, interlocked, clustered together to form the village, make for a sense of dislocation in time and space. Factory chimneys spout pale smoke, which mingles with that of straw fires to form the forever dun-colored sky.\nI can\u2019t walk into his memories, but I suppose they must engender some particularly unhappy feelings. Industry brought rapid development to these small, forgotten communities, and left behind scars, scars that can\u2019t be forgotten or washed away.\nThe memory ceases here, abruptly.\nThese memories are not problematic in terms of content. Everything is authentic: people, things, events. With a sudden jump out of the situation, real memories are easily distinguishable from dreams and fantasies.\nBut from our perspective, when a data stream ends so smoothly and plainly, it means it originally didn\u2019t end there.\nSomething has been deleted.\nNot lost or forgotten, but intentionally deleted.\nMany sections of memory are like onions cut up by a kitchen knife, memories gutted and torn to pieces. Moments seeming to lead somewhere have been cut short, crudely and violently.\nSomewhat angrily, I finish watching the first batch of memory extracts.\nIn consciousness upload, memories of youth become the foundation for constructing a worldview. Restorationists, responsible for cobbling together an uploaded consciousness when automation fails, should understand this. And yet they cut these memories into senseless fragments, and wantonly deleted so much.\nI often come across finely trimmed memories, but I\u2019ve never seen traces of such drastic cuts before. The subject is a common civil servant, no criminal record, no obvious shortcomings morally or in terms of character.\nSo why this meddling? There\u2019s no sense in it!\nThe subject seems completely ignorant of his unfortunate situation.\nHe only knows he lost some memories, some important feeling or attachment.\n\u201cI want to search for someone,\u201d he says.\nI nod.\n\u201cOf course, everyone who comes here wants to retrieve memories, or love, or a part of their personality.\u201d\nAccording to the record, he suffered a data avalanche during upload. Perhaps this was the restorationist\u2019s initial reason for cutting memories.\nIt\u2019s extraordinary good luck he survived at all.\nGenerally, when it comes to total transfer, the consciousness stored in the data stream must be completed quickly, otherwise synaptic electrical signals will rapidly vanish, becoming meaningless heat and noise. Thus, we must selectively abandon much data.\nIn fact, only 0.2% of the data is truly valuable, consisting of personality, mood, language, and memory.\nIn the instant of transfer from brain to information network, the base, biology-governing infrastructure of the brain, is automatically distinguished and deleted. We no longer need the feedback of hot or cold, hungry or full. All we need is the important stuff: love, memory, personality.\nIf, during this process, someone\u2019s memory information deviates too much from the standard model, error deletions and processing delays readily arise. We call this an avalanche.\nIf too much data is lost, or crucial data is lost, it may be impossible to reconstruct a mature personality. Genuine soul-death, in other words. But if the subject\u2019s luck is neither too bad nor too good, they will survive, truncated, a portion of memory or personality lost.\nJust like him.\nI hastily thumb through his memories, while listening to his simple narration of his experiences.\nLiang Sheng, born in 1987 on the North China Plain.\nWhen he\u2019s 9 years old, his father dies in a construction accident. His mother vanishes soon afterward, leaving no message behind, taking with her a small fortune in compensation funds. Liang Sheng ends up living with his paternal grandparents.\nThe memory gaps begin around here.\nLiang Sheng later passes the provincial capital\u2019s middle school entrance exam. He repeats a year, and tests into college at 19, and leaves home. During his undergrad years he begins to suffer serious depression, complicated by a sense that the feelings of two personalities are at odds in his mind\u2014or to use the common parlance, schizophrenia.\nLater we find a big memory gap\u2014events unknown.\nFinally, he completes his studies, graduates, begins work at a local tax bureau, is steadily promoted, settles down and marries, has a daughter, and lives an ordinary life. Toward the end, with some money saved, he decides to upload his consciousness.\n\u201cThere is someone missing from my memories,\u201d he says. \u201cI can feel it. Love, warmth, all these feelings . . . I have so many beautiful memories. I\u2019m grateful for my life, but I have this nagging feeling that someone is missing.\u201d\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u201cVery sure. There\u2019s someone there. Every time I think of this person, I feel that warmth. I mean, I have a wife and daughter, but it\u2019s not them. It\u2019s just not the same.\u201d\nI nod.\nFeelings are always difficult to describe clearly.\nI know he yearns for this missing love. Loneliness stalks him like his own shadow.\nAll those scenes featuring his parents are grand, solemn occasions, usually in winter, bright red New Year decorations contrasting with snow stretching as far as the eye can see.\nSoon after comes that first memory I saw. Liang Sheng\u2019s mother vanishes, and the villagers say she\u2019s no longer fit to be called a mother. His grandparents don\u2019t have time to look after him. It\u2019s all they can do to keep him fed and clothed.\nI begin to suspect that this missing person of Liang Sheng\u2019s is just a fantasy, or delusion.\nThe lonely, yearning to be held, need fellow travelers to lick their wounds with. If they can\u2019t find such companions, they comfort themselves.\nIn any case, all his secrets hide in those blank spaces. Perhaps I can conduct a thorough investigation based entirely on memory, or maybe I\u2019ll have to leap free of memory\u2019s fetters.\n\u201cThe odds of finding your lost memories are low,\u201d I tell him, \u201cbut of course there\u2019s another way. I could go outside the data and seek the memory that way. But you know, that could take a while. Moreover, even if I find what you\u2019re looking for, I\u2019d have to evaluate whether you could safely receive the information. So, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell you.\u201d\n\u201cI understand,\u201d he says, quite serene. \u201cThe last time I applied, I received no answer. All records were classified unreadable.\u201d\n\u201cNothing else? Admins will usually give some comment in the way of feedback.\u201d\n\u201cAfter the protective deletions related to my avalanche,\u201d he says, \u201cthere was only the \u2018classified unreadable\u2019 message. I asked others about it. Apparently, it\u2019s a pleasantry that means he didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\n\u201cNot uncommon,\u201d I say.\n\u201cI know being an administrator is difficult,\u201d he says in a low voice. \u201cStill having a body, and memories of love and warmth, it\u2019s extraordinary that you subject yourself to this sort of work. This matter of mine is perhaps . . . difficult, but to me it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\u201cI will help you,\u201d I say. \u201cFor the sake of a human being and his memories, I can stick around.\u201d\nIn the end, I don\u2019t tell him about the excessive memory deletions. Reason, after a long struggle, prevails over my sense of justice.\nOf course, perhaps I\u2019ll consider filing a complaint or appeal with his restorationist. Theoretically, an admin has the right to do so.\n\u201cOkay, please confirm again,\u201d I say. \u201cIncluding all of the foregoing dialogue, this section of memory will be erased. You\u2019re clear on that?\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t my first time around,\u201d Liang Sheng replies, calm as ever.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nAfter this segment of memory has been erased, I\u2019ll tell him to go back and await news.\nThis is all I can tell him.\nApplication Number 7529910456\nEND\nI think of this as a special case among many applications.\nPlenty of people lose memories during consciousness upload, and quite a few are more serious cases than he. If he\u2019s different, it\u2019s probably because an unqualified restorationist handled him after his data avalanche.\nOr perhaps his restorationist was talented and did the best anyone could have.\nWho knows? I calm down as time passes. Memory deletion is hard work, and unnecessary deletions are bound to be intentional, with definite motives behind them.\nIt is not until several days later, with the beginning of the social investigations, that I begin to realize this is no simple matter.\nIt doesn\u2019t take deep thinking. A primary school student could see how different he is. Under his social contact restrictions, his banned contacts list contains an astonishing 452 people.\nHow is this possible?\nBarring the unforeseen, these records contain his friends and family, kith and kin, all his social relations.\nCommon sense tells us that, in general, the average person can maintain a social contact network of no more than 150 people.\nAnd this list has gone beyond mere \u201cacquaintances.\u201d The details are classified, above an admin\u2019s clearance level.\nSocial contact bans don\u2019t happen often.\nThey\u2019re usually from the subject\u2019s own settings, people the subject doesn\u2019t want to meet or interact with. Or, serious conflicts with others during one\u2019s life can lead to contact bans at the restorationist intervention level.\nCreditors, officials, or businessmen with many enemies.\nBut even in those cases, I\u2019ve never seen a banned contacts list of 452 people, and this list is classified, restorationist level or above . . .\nWhy?\nHis social relationships have been wiped clean, leaving no trace.\nI have seen a similar memory model, a former Navy R&D Ministry engineer. Many of his colleagues chose to forgo the continued life of upload, but in the end, he couldn\u2019t make that immense sacrifice. Thus, for the price of severe social contact restriction and memory sequestration, he retained his personality, and was even able to maintain contact with his family and share memories with them.\nSo, what about Liang Sheng?\nDid something happen in those four blank years that necessitated thorough memory deletion? What might be concealed behind those fragmented memories of childhood? Did it all start back then?\nCuriosity spurs my investigation on, while a voice in my head nags me: perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be meddling in other people\u2019s business.\nIndeed, even ten-year-old children ought to know that investigation can be dangerous.\nI\u2019m just a common admin.\nFortunately, admins tend to have relatively high adaptability in terms of brain structure and modes of thinking.\nI can indeed leave this place, the Second World, which only exists and has form as information. But I only have one short holiday every three months.\nKeeping up with our time-consuming and difficult work, we cannot afford more extravagant or frequent rests. But Liang Sheng\u2019s social contacts ban prevents me from doing all my investigating during work hours. I could take the investigation further during my next leave. I could seek his past in the real world, but I wouldn\u2019t be getting paid.\nAdministration is a hard, petty, low profession. We\u2019re always replaceable.\nPerhaps I should be like his last admin, say \u201cno comment\u201d regarding his memories. It would be slightly better than hearing he\u2019s powerless, but it\u2019s even sadder.\nHowever, in addition to reason, there\u2019s another unchanging principle in the world, true since time immemorial. When you begin to weigh the pros and cons of something, doing your utmost to prevent yourself from acting, you\u2019ve already reached your decision, firmly, deep down and beyond any value assessment.\nThose big gaps in his memory, laden with grief and loneliness beyond description, finally compel me to set off in search of his memories.\nThus, on the second day of my vacation, I fly north, toward my goal and hopefully the truth.\nTime flies, villages become towns, ups and downs follow economic fluctuations. The village of Liang Sheng\u2019s memory has changed. People have moved away one by one. Only the white birches remain, standing quietly in the autumn wind.\nLiang Sheng\u2019s contemporaries and friends have passed away, some choosing to upload; but thanks to Liang Sheng\u2019s contact ban, I can\u2019t obtain contact permissions for them.\nAs the week wears on and I come up empty-handed, my curiosity gives way to frustration.\nI decide to leave. My remaining vacation time can be well spent at home, resting. But the night before my flight, I break the case wide open, almost by accident.\nA hospital birth record from 1987.\nHis birth certificate might be an important ID document, but I considered it useless to my investigation. The contact details and address have long since become invalid. What useful information could there be? But when I look at it this time, I see two names on the record.\nLiang Sheng, and Liang Xuan.\nThey were born approximately 25 minutes apart.\nLiang Xuan?\nThe name is like a bolt of lightning streaking through my mind.\nAll the clues point to one answer. There is a rational explanation for everything.\nLiang Sheng has a brother. A brother thoroughly deleted from his memory! I nearly leap out of bed in my excitement.\nLiang Sheng was a difficult name to research online, but Liang Xuan is different.\nMy thinking was trapped by false appearances, in meticulously trimmed memories and the falsehood they\u2019re meant to portray. I believed all along that Liang Sheng was an only child, and he believes the same, but it\u2019s not so!\nMaybe he didn\u2019t need the erasure himself. Maybe it was someone else. Maybe Liang Sheng is an innocent who\u2019s been drawn into something bigger.\nLiang Xuan. I spent a week investigating, exhausting every means, consuming nearly half of my vacation time, and now I\u2019ve stumbled upon the name in the simplest way.\nBut it could be worse.\nVia online records, and the oral accounts of people still alive, I gradually sketch out the face of the past.\nAnd it\u2019s not at all in line with what I thought.\nIn autumn of 1996, Liang Sheng and Liang Xuan\u2019s father died. Their mother returned to her hometown, and never showed up again.\nLiang Xuan had been going with his migrant worker parents on their trips, while Liang Sheng stayed home. After the accident, both were raised by their paternal grandparents.\nLater, due to severe economic pressure, Liang Xuan dropped out of school to do manual labor, working to support Liang Sheng, who had slightly better grades, as he continued on to high school. During the year Liang Sheng repeated a grade, when he became depressed after his college entrance exam, Liang Xuan immediately moved to his brother\u2019s city, and Liang Sheng\u2019s mood gradually stabilized.\nOut of fraternal concern, Liang Xuan frequently visited his brother. In 2001, concerned for his own future, Liang Xuan joined the army.\nHe and Liang Sheng had the same ability and intelligence and aspirations. If things had been different, Liang Xuan might have matched or even outdone his brother\u2019s academic accomplishments.\nFrom age 9 to 19, they were together from morning to night. And they saw each other often during the following four years. Fourteen years altogether.\nLiang Xuan\u2019s conduct went above and beyond a big brother\u2019s scope. He did his utmost to support his younger brother, and to love him, utterly devoted. This was love with no thought of reciprocation, or maybe Liang Sheng\u2019s gratitude was reciprocation enough, and all that Liang Xuan prayed for.\nThe last record ends at 2051. Liang Sheng was seriously ill and chose to upload his consciousness. He suffered a terminal data avalanche. Soon afterward and without hesitation, Liang Xuan chose to jointly upload.\nHe was Liang Sheng\u2019s twin, so of course he also suffered an avalanche.\nThe restorationist in charge braved dangerous ethical waters to perform a high-risk procedure, the merging of two personalities. The data from two people was fed into an algorithm for integrating fragmented data. The memories were reviewed, and contradictory or redundant memories were deleted.\nLiang Sheng and Liang Xuan. Two lifetimes of memories.\nThe majority of Liang Xuan\u2019s memories were discarded, leaving Liang Sheng\u2019s to fill those vast spaces. Childhood memories complemented and completed each other, some belonging to Liang Sheng, some to Liang Xuan.\nLiang Xuan returned to his hometown at nine years old, after his father passed away, so large-scale memory deletion and revision began from then on. Then there were the times they were together during the university years. Due to differences of identity, status, and perspective, retaining feasible memories of this time was more conspicuously difficult. Later, continuing to visit often, they were just brothers, to the extent that those memories usually bore little trace of revision.\nAll young people want to leave home, to grow up. But those bygone days never vanish. Instead, as time goes on, they come to seem extremely precious.\nThey were both children yearning for love and warmth. They both had strong and competitive hearts. In the end, two similar, fragmented minds were successfully merged, and two became one.\nIn the records of the corporeal world, Liang Xuan is registered as deceased, his upload failed.\nThe Second World records were altered, Liang Sheng\u2019s family tree revised. In Second World, Liang Xuan never existed.\nLiang Xuan\u2019s wife had passed, dead of acute disease, when he decided to upload. She never uploaded herself. His son and daughter are still alive. Their father left them overnight, for the sake of another old man they barely knew.\nI will not disturb their lives. I dare not imagine how they would react to the truth.\nLove may be very important and have real weight. Not based on proximity in time, space, or blood kinship, and not resting on moral judgement or the will to change a preordained fate. Rather, love is important in the disparity of life and death, in life-and-death choices, which are brutal and cruel as nature.\nAnd Liang Sheng, in the middle of the vortex, cannot understand it all.\nWhen I return to work, I record \u201cno result\u201d on his application.\nFirst and foremost, I must protect him and his restorationist. He exists beyond the realm of ethics, and that brave restorationist has done enough to go to prison. Moreover, a consciousness composed of mishap and experiment might not be up to bearing the truth.\nMeanwhile, there is another question. Who actually is he? Liang Xuan or Liang Sheng? Or both?\nOf course, a few words sent to him would go a long way, and would certainly be true: \u201cYou are loved, and the one who loves you is always at your side.\u201d\nI want to tell him this, but I can\u2019t open my mouth.\nThe truth would do very little for him, in terms of satisfaction or consummation. He yearns for warmth, for an embrace, and was long ago left with nothing but a remote, cherished memory.\nPerhaps he will continue to seek these feelings for a long time.\nMaybe that\u2019s for the best. Sometimes the unattainable feeling can be the most beautiful.\nI meant to use polite formality to end the feedback message. I\u2019m about to send when I hesitate, and I go back and revise.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t find your memories. Very sorry. Cherish well what you long for. Those things are also an aspect of memory.\u201d\nThe memory of our conversation is no longer on record. These words will be all he gets.\nAnd they are all I want to say.\nI still remember my youth, vaguely, murkily. The past is like a treasure hoard of text, images, and video files in the wake of a website shutdown\u2014erased. But primordial passions and dreams are still backed up, intact, in the softest places of my heart.\nI suppose Liang Sheng feels something like that. It\u2019s easy to imagine.\nYears from now I expect I\u2019ll still recall them, their comradery arising from blood. Lonely children shouldering pain together, forging ahead for 14 years. Even with the memories lost, that love and warmth can\u2019t ever be forgotten.\nMy admin\u2019s instinct tells me he will continue with his search, continue to hesitate, strive, and come up empty-handed.\nBut I think they pray for the same things for each other: to be able to walk in the world as before, to vaguely recall that warm feeling, to know happiness both tiny and grand.\nTranslated and published in partnership with Storycom.\nAndy Dudak is a writer and translator of science fiction.

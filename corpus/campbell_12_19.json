Once. Twice. Her face\u2014smiling\u2014froze in a cloud of pixels, while her arm\u2014the wide, emphatic gestures that were as much a marker of her identity as the color of her eyes or her fingerprints\u2014swept the screen, leaving blue eddies, whirlpools of information. Then silence, but her mouth moved, leaving a flesh-colored smudge across the top half of her head.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve cut out again,\u201d I said.\n The picture reset. She was saying something that made her laugh.\n \u201cYour hair looks really good,\u201d I said.\n \u201cWha\u2014\u201d\n I waited. Repeated myself.\n \u201cYes,\u201d she said, suddenly clear, \u201cI cut it myself because the guy they get in is terrible. He let me use his scissors, at least. So chic and DIY. If it was 2015 I\u2019d pin it\u2014\u201d\n Slideshow, for which I was paying five dollars a minute. Figures in black pacing against the yellow cinder block wall of the common room. I tried not to look at them because it was always better not to look at them. It was better when I could see the windows and get a look at where she was.\n \u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d I said. \u201cI only paid for fifteen minutes, cause last time you had the drill and I thought maybe\u2014\u201d\n The hand, now trailing pixels. It was definitely her face, but I searched her jawline for the suture where her appearance had been attached, virtually, to this body, a scrim of pixels over the person that was\u2014as far as anything was these days\u2014my mother. Her smile. Her expressive hands. No matter how empty the content of our words, there was comfort in seeing her speak.\n I could not, though, let go of the suspicion that this face I was searching\u2014hanging again, lag deforming the number on her gray uniformed shoulder\u2014was not my mother, so much as the collected fragments of her from a hundred thousand hours of CCTV footage and intercepted video conferences and Google hangouts and whatever other material had streamed through the state\u2019s huge filter-feeding machines, snuffling all traffic\u2014dark and light, private or public\u2014for the information it required on problematic\u2014\n \u2014Such thoughts are unproductive.\n This woman I speak to, who is my mother, and may not be by mother, but who fills the space in my life called mother. I will continue to chat with her when I can because the illusion\u2014if it is an illusion\u2014is so close to reality that sometimes I am taken in and relax into daughterly affection.\n The black silhouettes in the background of the common room do nothing to interfere with our conversation because no part of our conversation can be hidden from the eye that watches us all, which is not an eye, but the hundred thousand eyes of a filter-feeding behemoth made entirely of information. She sends me messages at night, long discourses on the problem of making the food palatable, or the solitaire she plays, or the scrabble tournaments she organizes. I can hear the powerful gears of her mind grinding against the cinder block walls of the place, finding things to put in order, to make, to fix. Her resources are limited: games and other companions, the discussions and lectures and regular chastisement that she undergoes, but which she does not mention, but which is always implied. I can imagine her turning that mind toward the problem of 2 + 2 being 5, producing the right answer for the individuals who ask her\u2014daily, hourly, by the minute\u2014to repeat this new truth. A problem of philosophy? Perhaps of language, she would say, from the perspective of neo-radical-orthodoxy, or post-Platonism. One needs only to adjust the definitions in that portion of one\u2019s brain that is cordoned off from reality in order to comply with the ideologies of the state. That\u2019s how she could give the \u201cright\u201d answer without dying of it.\n She never says these things. The mother who exists in my mind\u2014which might or might not align with the mother on the screen, or in my messages\u2014would do such things. It would be necessary for her survival, once the small collection of paper books had been arranged by the Library of Congress system, with gaps on the shelf for \u201ccritical theory\u201d and \u201cresistance\u201d and \u201cescape plans.\u201d\n But what kind of escape could she possibly need? The enclosures are beautiful, despite the yellow cinder block walls. I\u2019ve seen them when her back is to the window, trees and mountains framed in bulletproof glass. When I was a kid, we often drove through the Rockies and stopped at Banff. Once we stayed in a massive ch\u00e2teau on Lake Louise. There were men and women in lederhosen outside, playing alphorns. The air, when we left the sticky lowland fug of our car, was so fresh and lovely I wanted to laugh. The glaciers had receded, but you could still see the blue-white glow of them up high, far beyond us.\n I think\u2014I\u2019m not sure\u2014but I think I have seen similar mountains in the brief moments she directs the camera over her shoulder and out the window. The time zone can\u2019t be far too different, but the summer nights are bright there, so it must be farther north. Toad River, I think. One of the big provincial parks. I have looked at maps\u2014antique ones on paper, tearing at the folds\u2014and seen the gaps in the satellite images, and I have wondered, is she there? Close to 60?\n This winter I\u2019ll watch the angles of sunlight and track the darkness behind her. I\u2019ll hope she picks up on my questions: I\u2019ve had trouble with my nasturtiums again. Are you growing anything? And hope she turns her camera toward the window, talks about what she\u2019s planted in the gardens that are supposed to be so therapeutic.\n We live in an age of infinitely preserved information, so it\u2019s not actually odd that I saved every video call on an external hard drive. At night I turned off the Wi-Fi and studied my mother\u2019s face for evidence of fakery. I didn\u2019t search for \u201cten ways to spot deepfakes\u201d because that left fingerprints, and I\u2019m already a problematic citizen, confirmed as such by my associations, rather than any action I have taken. To be visible meant you have done something to deserve visibility, after all. And if our exploration of the human genome means anything, it\u2019s that my genes matter. I am treacherous.\n You could inherit treachery, or be infected with it, by the people who waited in government offices, slouching from hard blue chair to hard blue chair, sharing between them the rumors and possibilities regarding what happened to the missing. Camps. Education centers. Wilderness highways that stopped dead on the other side of the great divide. The blank spots that are slowly overtaking our digital maps, even archived versions I thought I had kept safe. No more news from Fort Mac, not for a couple of years now. The pipelines never leak. Silence accompanied any disruption of gasoline, or the regular oil slicks up and down the Salish Sea, where all the fish are dead. There\u2019s another dam on the Peace River to celebrate, but the blackouts got worse.\n When I had thoroughly and silently examined the information available (is that a tamarack? A black spruce? Is that a mountain?) It occurred to me that as the woman I talk to might be scrimmed with my mother\u2019s face, so might be the room in which she sat. The darkness and light I have so painstakingly tracked, the faint, blue line of a mountain, and a pink winter sunset at three in the afternoon? That may well mean nothing. Worse than nothing: deception.\n At work I was also a watcher. I was part of a team that sanity-checked the AI that surveils traffic errors in the western provinces. I looked for anomalies and found ways to integrate them into the AI\u2019s understanding, slowly eliminating my own job, as the anomalies grew rarer and the world more perfectly known. I thought, sometimes, following on my father\u2019s philosophical leanings, that this was the goal of our state: perfect knowledge of landscapes and people and relationships. So perfect that the simulacrum we saw on the screen was more perfect than the territory we possessed. The woman on the screen was my mother, as was the woman in my messages, so perfectly had she been synthesized by the state that also slit\u2014\n \u2014Unproductive.\n \u201cHave you heard from da\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014He\u2019s okay. Did you get that? You\u2019re a slideshow.\u201d\n \u201cWeak\u2014\u201d\n I was a slideshow, too. Maybe she didn\u2019t even think it was me. Maybe there was another woman she spoke to midweek, and she believed that was the real daughter, and she only spoke to me because the system required her to maintain the fiction. Maybe she had a million daughters asking her leading questions. Maybe.\n Still smiling, in case we connected, I wrote on my tablet and held it up to my phone: HE\u2019S STILL WORKING ON THE SOLAR PANELS. Dad withdrew from the city to our old cabin in the interior (is she near there? Farther north and east. The forests I have seen out that window are deep and green), when Mom left, or disappeared, or was taken, whichever mode you choose to use for description. Dad and I just say \u201cwhen Mom left\u201d like it\u2019s the only date that matters. He hasn\u2019t come back to the city since. I took two weeks off work to help him chuck their things, and carry what was important\u2014photographs, old books, her clothes, her jewelry\u2014to the cabin. We couldn\u2019t afford to take much, with the cost of gas. The house was requisitioned later, for a nominal fee that didn\u2019t cover the time or gas it would have taken him to get the papers signed. I don\u2019t go by there anymore. I don\u2019t like to see it.\n \u201cDo you remember when we camped at Banff?\u201d\n \u201cWhen you graduated from high school? Or are you talking about before Sophie\u2019s wedding?\u201d\n \u201cSophie? Piano teacher? At Banff?\u201d\n \u201cAunt Sophie, not piano Sophie. We were roommates all through grad school. If you were going to have a godmother, she would have been your godmother. You were pretty little that trip, though.\u201d\n I remember Banff, because we went right up to the glacier and Dad showed me where it had been each year, walking backward through time, saying this is when you were born and this is when I was born.\n \u201cI was like five? Four? I thought that was Emily\u2019s wedding.\u201d\n \u201cNo, Sophie. And I was maid of honor so I had to be there three days early, and you and Daddy just ate junk food and went on the swings until you threw up. You hated Fudgsicles for a year after that summer. I should have done that with more junk food. You\u2019d be vegan now.\n I actually am vegan. I do not remember having an aunt named Sophie. I\u2019m pretty sure it was Emily\u2019s wedding. Dad and I played on the merry-go-round until we were so dizzy, we stumbled across the soccer field toward the edge of the forest, collapsing on the grass until the world stopped spinning and we\u2019d expelled all the Doritos and gummy worms we\u2019d eaten. That afternoon, Mom\u2014woozy and white-faced after a late night\u2014got ready in a blue dress I had never seen before, her hair up high and her makeup all pretty. She carried me into this old lodge halfway up the mountain and shouted over my shoulder to friends I had seen in pictures, but never met, making jokes about things I didn\u2019t understand. Dad and I left during the dancing, but she came in long after that, laughing. She slept in late, grouchy, cuddling a water bottle to her pillow, while we went driving in search of coffee and hot chocolate. \u201cAnd what do you say to more Doritos, Mar?\u201d Dad asked, and I pretended to throw up.\n She said other things that left me watchful and adrenalized. I didn\u2019t draw attention to the discrepancies because her memory might be flawed, but so was mine. So was everyone\u2019s, except the filter-feeding behemoth that follows us all, and while we didn\u2019t seem to possess the same past, it possessed us equally. We found an equilibrium. For more than a year I didn\u2019t even hear from her, not even to confirm she still existed. I waited patiently in offices, both virtual queues and in person, and I went to Victoria to line up with all the others at the Ministry of Information Management and Retrieval. The answers were always the same: here\u2019s a chit with a number. We\u2019ll be in touch. Said with a synthetic smile by an AI phone tree, or a tired clerk behind glass. They will always get back to you.\n I am patient and consistent, also better connected than a lot of people, so I have pushed further than most. I also know the system better, and know when to leave things be, keep my head down, be grateful that I know my mother is alive. I am the model supplicant, waiting in dovelike patience outside the walls for the emergence of her mother, whose radical spirit has been (will be) corrected by the benevolent ministrations of the state.\n You got to know other people because you saw them at the offices and in the spillover corridors. Which wasn\u2019t to say you know them, just that you were familiar with their faces and concerns. Julie\u2019s looking for her brother and nephews. Chris wants to find his wife. Chris thinks she\u2019s in the foothills somewhere. Alberta has a few sites. You avoided the ones with loud voices who talked too loud about what was happening, even the explanations you really shouldn\u2019t say out loud: they have been replaced by bots of some description; their minds are being damaged beyond coherence by electroshock or DBS. Uncommon, but appealing: discrepancies are coded messages that only family will recognize, and thus communicate important information about location, and security movements, and the details of what\u2019s happening inside, in preparation for a massive action. We should all pool the discrepancies, and see what picture they show us, if we stand far enough back. We should talk. We should organize.\n I have never contributed to these efforts. In lineups\u2014the sorts of lineups that involve standing up every fifteen minutes to move one spot down in the long row of hard blue chairs\u2014I listened, but said nothing, only thought, you don\u2019t know how loud your voice is why don\u2019t you care that the walls are full of cameras and your face is so well known to the machine no one you love can ever be sure it\u2019s you talking to them.\n I didn\u2019t need specifics regarding what happened inside, because what happened inside is what\u2019s happened inside such education centers since they were first invented. Repetition and regulation. Rote recitation of truths regarding the nature of the society to which we belong. The principle being\u2014I knew this, because Mom told me\u2014that the surface recitation has a transformative effect on the mind, even if the mind resists the meaning of the words it says.\n And then the culturally-specific humiliation, and the strategic application of pain\u2014\n \u201c\u2014Recite platitudes that deny climate change,\u201d she said, \u201cor the refugee crisis or ethnic cleansing or forced sterilization or eugenics. The perfectibility of the human animal in an ideal society. Repeat it and eventually you believe it. Or act like you believe it, which is just as good as far as they\u2019re concerned.\u201d\n That was near the end, when she said those sorts of things out loud, and in text, and every last fragment collected and shared them across whatever the network is now. Five Eyes. Nine Eyes. Ten Billion Eyes. In collaboration, those systems extracted meaning and implication from the marks she made on the screens and the sounds from her mouth\u2014rarely out of range of a microphone\u2014cross-referencing those patterns with other patterns. They flagged her profile. They saw the outcomes, and identified my mother as a point of vulnerability. In her terms: an imperfect citizen.\n Me too, probably, and Dad, though we\u2019re less threatening. We don\u2019t talk often anymore. It was difficult to have a conversation when most of what matters is dangerous to say out loud. Dad mentions that he\u2019s repainting the garage. I talk about how I want to do a bike trip through Oregon. Dad says he thinks he\u2019s got a rat in the basement. I say I had some decent wontons at a new place that opened around the corner. Hanging over our conversation, a list of things we don\u2019t mention: droughts (unless historical); disappearing island chains; climate refugees; the rage associated with rising temperatures and food prices; the\u2014\n \u2014But this isn\u2019t productive. We both know. We talk about whether he can catch the rat with a humane trap. We talk about how smart rats are, and how deftly they have adapted to human landscapes. I say I\u2019ll make a trip to help. He says no no, no need. I\u2019m fine. I say, you should come visit me, do city stuff, and he says no no no, no need. I\u2019m fine. We\u2019re both fine. As you can see, I am now good at lying.\n I ran into an aunt at some event, and she said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from your mom in ages, how is she?\u201d\n \u201cOh. She\u2019s doing better.\u201d\n \u201cBetter? What happened?\u201d\n \u201cShe contracted one of the antibiotic-resistant strains of TB, and she\u2019s taking some time to recover.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear it. Where is she?\u201d\n \u201cOne of the new sanatoriums. She\u2019ll be in for a while.\u201d\n \u201cOh, Mar. She\u2019ll be in my thoughts. Pass that on, would you? Or maybe I\u2019ll email her.\u201d\n This was the safe response. An innocuous message passed on. No further inquiry. No possibility of betrayal.\n I set my keys on the little shelf by the door and sighed, the way you do when you take off high heels or get somewhere quiet where you can cry. Then I heard someone shifting on my couch.\n She squealed. \u201cMar! Mar! Look at you! The last time I saw you was at your mom\u2019s fiftieth. When was that? Oh god don\u2019t tell me. That means we\u2019re old.\u201d\n I have an Aunt Sophie. She was a thin, athletic woman, honey-brown hair, not Mom\u2019s pixie cut, but of the same vintage, choppy, with playful silver highlights. She was dressed in elegant athleisure. And you know, at that moment she could have been an aunt, one of the women from Mom\u2019s PhD program, or a second cousin, or someone from the Elder college where she talked political philosophy.\n \u201cWhere did you\u2014?\u201d\n \u201c\u2014I\u2019m just going to be in town for a couple of weeks, and I\u2019m going to be nearby while I deal with a contract. I saw your mom, you know.\u201d\n \u201cWhat?\u201d\n \u201cLast week. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I knew you were in the city, but I didn\u2019t know where, obviously, and\u2014okay, I was a little embarrassed that I\u2019ve been so out of touch with everyone. It\u2019s these short contracts. They\u2019re disorienting. I travel. So. Much.\u201d\n \u201cYou heard from Mom?\u201d\n \u201cYes. And I realized how much I\u2019ve missed of your life these last years. Remember when I lived on Elm Street and you guys used to come over and we\u2019d go to that one park with the splash pad, and then we\u2019d get ice cream on the drive?\u201d\n I found myself nodding. It\u2019s what you do. Lie.\n \u201cAnyway.\u201d My new aunt said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come over and I had your mom\u2019s key so. I brought you dinner, too. Are you still vegan?\u201d\n \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cFor five years now.\u201d\n \u201cGood. You know, while I was waiting I remembered how much you hated cooking when you were a teenager\u2014remember how your mom tried to teach you to make, I don\u2019t know, spaghetti sauce, and the fights. Oh God. I heard about the fights.\u201d\n I had not remembered those fights in years. \u201cThe Bolognese,\u201d I said. \u201cI still can\u2019t make it. On principle.\u201d\n \u201cI brought pakoras. They\u2019re off the fucking hook\u2014I ate like two of them waiting for you. Let\u2019s go eat the rest.\u201d\n The pakoras were excellent. The rice she also brought was fragrant and nutty underneath the curry. The beer delicious, bubbling out of our glasses and over the rough table on my back deck, which just had room for four people. Sophie talked about grad school and Mom, about parties they threw together, about staying up late crying over deadlines and supervisors, about graduation, and how Mom had blown hers off for the government job, but been there the next year for Sophie\u2019s, already pregnant with me.\n \u201cSo you were at my graduation. Good luck charm.\u201d\n I slid into this the way we slid into so many things: the loss of cities to the encroaching waters and deserts, the swamps and the Zika virus creeping north along the Mississippi, as the days grew hotter and the mosquitoes adapted. A kind of compliant quiet\u2014pleasant, safe\u2014overtook me as I thought yes, of course I had an aunt named Sophie. Of course.\n She slept that night on the couch. It was the obvious thing to do. Curfew.\n That night I lay in bed and recited the facts of my life: I do not have an aunt named Sophie; my mother did not have antibiotic-resistant TB and was not in a sanatorium on one of the quarantine islands. My mother is in an internment camp with yellow cinder block walls, somewhere in the mountains, far enough north that she\u2019s surrounded by tamarack, maybe by black spruce. At the end of the road with no exit. Britney is gone. The dam on the Peace River was bombed last year. Gasoline shortages are worse.\n In the dark I texted Mom, or the Mom-function of some bot, or the person assigned to be my mom that shift, while my real mom\u2014the internal enemy\u2014underwent her daily reeducation, which wasn\u2019t happening but was happening all the time. Maybe, I thought, as I typed, these words are shuttling right out to the living room, where my aunt Sophie was not sleeping, but surveilling the various fictions of my family relationships. I wondered how many nieces and nephews she had.\n Sophie is here.\n Who? The answer came too quickly. Maybe she wasn\u2019t sleeping. She had trouble sleeping, she said, despite all the fresh air and exercise. Maybe she wasn\u2019t Mom, maybe she was\u2014\n Sophie. My aunt.\n Awesome. How is she? I haven\u2019t seen her for ages. She asked about you, though. Not surprised she turned up. She just finished that contract in Halifax.\n She\u2019s great. She brought pakoras from the place on Main.\n Oh man. I miss those.\n They\u2019re really good. We have leftovers. I wish we could send them.\n I want pot stickers from Hon\u2019s. And honeymoon rice. Then we should go for gelato.\n Triple scoop. Then back for another three.\n You should ask your dad if he\u2019ll come into town and have gelato with you.\n He\u2019s so busy.\n I didn\u2019t write he hates the city now or he hates people now or neither of us can afford the gas if we want to eat. I wrote, he\u2019s so busy and somewhere, the mom-function, or the behemoth, took note.\n Have you heard from Britney?\n And then I had to stop, because the question hurt so much it didn\u2019t matter whether the woman on the other side was my mother, or a fiction, or some synthesis of true and false too complicated to understand.\n You ask yourself as you read my record: why is she so compliant? Why doesn\u2019t she tell the woman who keeps visiting daily, bringing food and asking questions about work and dating and Mom and Dad, why doesn\u2019t she just say, you aren\u2019t my aunt, I don\u2019t have an aunt.\n I answer: because this is what we all do. Because I don\u2019t want to end up removed to a complex somewhere in the northern mountains, where if I escaped the hundreds of km between me and a highway would kill me before any of the guards had to. Because things can always get worse for everyone involved. Because they need someone on the outside.\n But also. Also. Because she knows that I love honeymoon rice, and that I would like nothing better than to gorge on pakoras and gelato with Mom and Dad, and talk about inconsequential things, without reference to\u2014or\u2014or\u2014but rather what we watched on TV and whether it was a Mac\u2019s convenience or a 7-11 that we used to stop at on our way out of town for holiday road trips (it was definitely a 7-11). Whether the aphids are back on the nasturtiums. I talk this way with the entity who is/isn\u2019t my mother, who may be my mother, who may be human. The entity behaves so exactly like my mother, and I like that, because then I don\u2019t think about how she\u2019s dead, or in solitary, somewhere, with the volume on prog rock or economic propaganda at 79 decibels for weeks on\u2014\n \u2014But this is not productive.\n My face betrays itself to the camera that is watching me, that also hears the catch in my voice when I thank the barista for my coffee. I use the drive-through because it offers marginally more privacy, since it can\u2019t read your whole body, and because if you order with the app the drink is there and you don\u2019t have to say anything and you have the pleasure of silence, though your face\u2014the breathing, roughened by repressed tears\u2014is still visible to it.\n The girl who gives me her drink is impassive, but I think\u2014a flicker of sympathy in her eyes? She can\u2019t tell that I\u2019m contaminated by my association with my mother, that I have an Aunt Sophie. But maybe she\u2019s contaminated, too, and has an Aunt Sophie. Who knows? You don\u2019t wait long enough to find out.\n Sophie and I watch movies and go for walks, and sometimes I think how much I would like it if Sophie was my aunt. She clucks over me when I cough and asks whether I\u2019ve tried turmeric and makes me tea of mint and ginger. It would be very easy to accept the gentleness of this state-sponsored intervention, ignoring the deviations I hear in conversation, and the fact that she is also someone else\u2019s aunt. I like Sophie. That\u2019s what I keep thinking. I like her. It\u2019s such a relief to have someone like a mom around that I cry, sometimes, when she checks in to see if I ate lunch.\n We walk past my neighbors who say, who\u2019s that, Mar? And I say, this is my Aunt Sophie, and they all smile, and I don\u2019t know\u2014not really\u2014if they believe me, or if Aunt has become code for them as it has for me, for something you can\u2019t talk about, a person who is close to you like a missing lover, like family, but who is\u2014\n Dad called. Unusual, therefore treacherous. \u201cIt\u2019s confirmed,\u201d he said.\n Sophie was on the porch. She\u2019d waved yes yes when I got the call, take it, and she kept eating. I\u2019d made us cold noodles with mint and basil from the pot I kept in the corner of the little deck.\n \u201cWhen?\u201d\n \u201cThis morning. I\u2019m going to head out tomorrow morning.\u201d\n \u201cI could be there\u2014\u201d\n \u201c\u2014No, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s contagious. You\u2019ll have to get checked out. They\u2019ll be in touch. Probably soon.\u201d\n \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n \u201cNothing. Just to hear your voice.\u201d\n In the silence my throat shut and on the other side of the line, his throat shut too. I tried to think of safe things I could say, but what would that even be? All conversations are recorded. All expression is evidence.\n \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n \u201cTB.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou know the one.\u201d\n We all knew what that meant. There\u2019s nothing for us to say, because probably all the feelings, all the fear and anger, were exhausted that first year when we didn\u2019t hear from Mom, and he went with me to the offices with the hard blue chairs. Now, though, it was just the familiar and inexorable creep of the end, as all us imperfect citizens were taken up, one by one.\n Sophie started as soon as I hung up the phone, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n I said nothing.\n \u201cTalk to me, honey.\u201d\n Mom used to call me honey. She still did sometimes, in text. Sometimes she didn\u2019t.\n \u201cIt\u2019s your dad, isn\u2019t it? I know how hard this is.\u201d\n I threw things into my pack. T-Shirts. Socks. Solar charger. Filter bottle. Fleece.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t go silent on me. Mar. Mar. Do you think this is what your mother wants? Seriously? You have to talk.\u201d\n Documents, hidden from her view by the closed door, on which she banged her fists, tucked into my waistband.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not good to bottle everything up inside. You need to learn to trust people.\u201d\n My backpack\u2014the giant frame one that Dad got me for my first real solo expedition the summer I was twenty. It cost twice what I wanted, but he insisted, and he\u2019d been right because here it still was. I checked my balance with Humanitas, the telecom provider for all the camps. Sanatoriums. Whatever. Ten minutes banked against next week\u2019s call, and enough for a handful of texts, so I hit dial.\n She didn\u2019t answer. I rang again, just swallowing the five dollars. Then the woman appeared, her back to the windows.\n \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t expect\u2014\u201d\n The image of my mother-not-mother hung, and reflexively I studied the margins of her face for the suture between reality and fiction, the faint betraying lines of an AI\u2019s interference.\n \u201cYou cut out.\u201d\n \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to hear from you. I heard from your dad yesterday, though, so both of you are off schedule. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n \u201cDad\u2019s sick.\u201d\n The image hung. I picked up the jiffy I had ready in case, and began writing on the white wall of my bedroom. DAD IS SICK IM GOING TO VISIT HIM.\n Her face\u2014hanging in the moment when she understood what I wrote\u2014was animated only by the shimmer of pixels across my screen. She might have dropped, but I kept my phone fixed on the wall so she had a chance to see it again. One way or another, they already knew, and if it was Mom. If it was. If. Then she had to know.\n \u201cAre you talking to her? Is that her?\u201d Sophie shouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t disturb her recovery, Mar. That\u2019s just fucking selfish.\u201d\n She said other things in quick succession, about my being a bad daughter, about how I was a bitch, about how I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on myself, careening from insult to affection in a split second in order to stop me from doing\u2014something. I wondered if she\u2019d try to hit me.\n I locked up the apartment with Sophie still following me, talking about opening up, saying are you a fucking rock? Tell me what\u2019s wrong with Bastien, he\u2019s my friend too, you can\u2019t shut me out. A thousand other platitudes about sharing the burden of pain.\n I got into the car. She stood in front of it.\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just put a tracker on me,\u201d I said, \u201cand let me go. It\u2019ll all be over soon anyway.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n I inched forward. She leaned onto the hood and I thought, this may be the single stupidest moment of my entire life.\n \u201cWe\u2019re family, Mar.\u201d\n Maybe she told the truth, though not in the way she thought. We were family in the sense that we were bound to the same omnivorous machine.\n \u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n I could hear her saying those words to someone else, someone standing behind me, someone looking out of my eyes, and I wanted to ask, who is it? Who are you talking to?\n I unlocked the door. She got in, face full of rage-tears.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t rescue him,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to just trust that things happen for a reason.\u201d\n I thought about killing her. I thought about killing myself. I thought about driving into the roadblock at the exit for Needle Park, which was now manned by American uniforms, hazmat suits, trucks with Chinese plates. But while I often have those thoughts, I have never pursued them. It\u2019s how I have survived as long as I have, why I haven\u2019t been scooped with my parents, with Brit\u2014\n \u2014But thinking of Britney would make things even worse than they were. So instead I thought about the roadblocks, and how the exits for Kingsvale and Brookmere and Coldwater were bulldozed, so you couldn\u2019t leave the car to feel the air change as you climb into the mountains. I thought about what might now be on the other side of the torn up concrete and rock.\n She talked. She laughed. She told the same stories about my mother in grad school, what a mess she was during her comps, cleaning the bathroom at midnight, smoking until dawn on their tiny, rotten front porch. Ha ha ha.\n I thought of all the times we started our summer road trips on the Coquihalla, headed to the cabin, or farther north and east. Other years due south along the American coast, watching the beaches change from shingle to sand, to Manzanita and Tillamook, then farther south until we found our way to California. I thought of camping, and the dogs with me in the back seat.\n Her throat raw with talk, she kept going, \u201cYour parents love you so much,\u201d she said, \u201cthey want what\u2019s best for you, and what\u2019s best is to let them get better.\u201d\n \u201cWe\u2019re going to need gas,\u201d I said. \u201cStop at Merritt.\u201d\n \u201cAre you even listening? I\u2019m here because I love you, Mar, and because I\u2019m trying to convince you to move on with your life, and let them go. You can\u2019t change this.\u201d\n Once, a year ago, when I still hadn\u2019t heard from Mom, and Dad had just moved to the interior but was off the grid because of the fires, and the Coquihalla was still roadblocked because of the attack on the dam, and I had no idea about anything anymore, and Britney was\u2014\n \u2014I had the opportunity to find an aunt, or a niece, or a cousin. This happened when you appeared to be as compliant as I did. Ashley\u2014my direct manager\u2014called me into a meeting with someone I\u2019d never seen before, a woman in a sleek gray suit who talked about how I could help Britney and my mother and anyone else I cared to help, by telling them about my extended family, about those cousins I met sometimes on the hard blue chairs. I told them I didn\u2019t have any cousins like that, but that I\u2019d think about it. I wondered, later, if my hesitation was enough. Maybe we were all damned because I thought instead of saying, yes yes whatever you like I\u2019ll find a cousin and tell you anything you need to know.\n The lineup at the gas station was better than Vancouver. Thirty minutes. I thought of killing her again, my Aunt Sophie, who had grown so familiar to me, messenger from a childhood I had not had, a life I did not lead in a country that no longer existed, full of loving familiar bonds, and gentle teasing, and a father not slowly dying of TB, a mother not being tortured by\u2014\n \u2014I said, \u201cThere has to be someone you\u2019re protecting, right?\u201d\n \u201cYou, Mar. You\u2019re my goddaughter,\u201d she said it mechanically, and I could imagine the dialogue somewhere in the dossier that archived me, identified my vulnerabilities, cataloged my failures. I have no godmother, no aunt, no mother, no wife. \u201cI swore at your christening that I would uphold the ethical and social bond of our relationship. That I would love you. I promised\u2014\u201d\n \u2014We moved a car length forward. You could smell the wildfires, and see last year\u2019s burnout, overgrown with fireweed.\n \u201cDaughter?\u201d I asked. \u201cYour sister? Granddaughter?\u201d\n It was like a moonscape out there, Dad said when he drove through after the fires. On the other side of the mountain, the cabin was safe, but probably not for many more seasons. I had always thought that I could escape there, if I needed to, get the camping gear and walk out to some place no one will ever set foot. A mountain. A valley where I could wait until this was over.\n \u201cYou should probably go see them,\u201d I said. \u201cWhoever they are. They\u2019d rather see you than get whatever help you think they\u2019ll get. Because you\u2019re not helping. Not really.\u201d\n When we got to the pump I filled up, then we went in to pay and get some water, and whatever candy was available because that\u2019s what you do in Merritt, you get snacks for the last two hours on the road, even if they were sparse and overpriced gummy worms.\n She said, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d\n I nodded.\n \u201cShe\u2019s not your mother, probably, the one you talk to. You know where your mother is. You know what they do.\u201d\n I nodded.\n \u201cI did actually know your parents in grad school. I did. You were in utero at my graduation. That\u2019s why they thought\u2014and I was already doing. It. This. For her. I was doing it because if I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n \u2014And I will grant her a little privacy here. It only takes a few words when it\u2019s people like us, the imperfect citizens of this perfectly known world. She told me things I do not wish to know, because they hurt to know, then we both looked instinctively for cameras and drones and microphones.\n She said, \u201cI have to. I\u2019ll just be. I have\u2014\u201d and she walked away.\n I went back to the car and drank from the water bottle, then started the engine. A full tank of gas, the sunlight brilliant, and I pulled out of the lot. I had, I figured, a couple of hours before they got to me, and by then, I would be at Dad\u2019s, and maybe we could talk for a few minutes before they came. I saw the signs for Peachland and Kelowna, and the sun was going down, and eating the gummy worms I could almost be on one of those other road trips, out from the city to the cabin for a week, or maybe past the mountains and somewhere else, north maybe. This time I\u2019d make Britney come with us, even if I had to beg her to take time away from work. And\u2014the image came to me, though I did not want it\u2014Sophie with us, sitting up late to talk with Mom. I could imagine another lifetime in which she was my aunt, when she and her daughter might have joined us for a week on the lake, drinking beer by the water, and swatting at the mosquitoes together.\n Rebecca Campbell is a Canadian writer and teacher whose speculative fiction has appeared most recently in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and Shadows and Tall Trees.

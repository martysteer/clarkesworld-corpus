For anyone who hasn\u2019t heard of this ancient challenge, the basics are: you write a 50K novel in November, at a rate of 1,667 words per day. Succeed and you get a badge, bragging rights, and\u2014if you participated in the forums\u2014new friends and peers. Most importantly, you get 50K of writing done.\nIt can be a big deal, Nano. A learning experience, a way to take your art seriously, a chance to finish a draft of a first book, a means of shutting off too-harsh internal saboteurs and critics . . . lots of great things can come of it.\nBut all too soon you slam into December 1st, and you\u2019re picking up the bits of your life you\u2019ve been neglecting for thirty days. One short month from today, some of you may be asking yourselves: I did it! Now what?\nThe answer lies in our distant fannish past.\nI am from a particular age group of SF fans who saw the original Star Trek not in its first run, in the late Sixties, but over the stretch that came later, when it aired in syndication. Badly cut to maximize the time available for commercials, it aired five days a week, once or twice a day.\nBy the time teenaged me came along to watch those 79 episodes, over and over and over again, there was a fair amount of Star Trek tie-in product to be had, almost all in the form of print media. David Gerrold, who at 23 years of age wrote that infamous episode \u201cThe Trouble with Tribbles,\u201d possibly salvaging the fortunes of the fun-fur industry forever, wrote one book just about that experience and a second book, The World of Star Trek, about the massive appeal of the show.\nSo as I was watching those episodes in rerun, I also had access to criticism, behind the scenes commentary about what it was like to be a TV writer, the actual \u201cTrouble with Tribbles\u201d teleplay, the history of a failed write-in campaign to save the show, photo novels (anyone remember photo novels?) and a billion other random research sources. My high school classmates and I chipped in to buy these things because, basically, science fiction was in short supply and some of us thought William Shatner and/or Leonard Nimoy and/or Nichelle Nichols was hot.\nWhat I didn\u2019t have access to was fanfic. I don\u2019t think I even heard about it until I was in university, getting to know the works of Joanna Russ.\nAs new shows got created and people continued to explore, discuss, and embroider, we realized Star Trek had pioneered a lot of the things we now think of as classic TV tropes. Some good, some bad: in one episode\u2014Plato\u2019s Stepchildren\u2014Kirk and Uhura were forced by mind-controlling aliens to kiss, in a scene that is quite cringingly awful. I didn\u2019t know about fanfiction and its tropes and memes, so I didn\u2019t recognize this textbook example of something that would eventually come to be called \u201cAliens made them do it.\u201d\nThis is exactly what it sounds like. You\u2019re writing something porny about two characters who, in canon, would never get it on. So aliens appear and make it happen. They use mind control, they use threats, they use deception. Lack of consent means it\u2019s one of those memes that has aged very badly. Why can\u2019t aliens force them to garden?\nOr . . . write?\nFor those who are about to Nano, you have thirty golden days in which you\u2019re sworn to produce pages. It\u2019s a rule. You have to do it or Klingons will ferociously mock you!\n(Pay up your health insurance. Klingons don\u2019t mock with just words.)\nCommitting to NaNoWriMo is like choosing aliens to make you to Do It.\nFor some, this will be wildly successful. For others it will work a bit, and for others not at all. No writing rule, technique, or challenge is one size fits all.\nGetting a book written is a big accomplishment. It\u2019s a tiring one, too. Some of the writers who do reach this goal\u2014who get their 50K and celebrate sweet, sweet victory!\u2014will find themselves stopping again. Just for a week. Well, a month. Oh, now it\u2019s Solstice. Well, maybe in 2019 . . . Soon they\u2019ll be beating themselves up about this.\nOn December 1st, your mission is to find another species of Do It Alien. Are they Vulcans? Andorians? Whoever they are, they\u2019re there to make writing a sustainable and organic part of your life. To happily produce new words and revise old ones on some kind of regular basis.\nIf you can escape the fires of NaNoWriMo and forge the beginning of a regular artistic practice, you will be vastly more likely to succeed in publishing . . . and that\u2019s true whether the fruits of this November are unadulterated genius or a hastily-written shambles. (I say this, by the way, as someone with two such Nano-shambles to my name.)\nGoing from hare to tortoise is easier said than done. I know that, and I know it sucks. This is why there are nine million writer essays on the web addressing the question \u201cHow do I find time to write?\u201d\nAnother of the reasons there are nine million essays, besides the fact that everyone wants to brag about how they get it done, is each creator\u2019s answer\u2014the fine-tuned mechanics of how they get down to it\u2014is unique.\nThere are barriers in everyone\u2019s life. They fall, roughly, into the following categories:\nOther commitments: family, job, inadequate housing, chronic health problems, social commitments, court dates, a wicked gaming habit, fighting the patriarchy.\nLogistical commitments: bad equipment, inappropriate workspace, distracting soundscape, lack of privacy, not realizing you need new glasses.\nSabotage: sometimes there are people who just don\u2019t want you to do it.\nPsychological barriers: You can\u2019t work without a deadline. You can\u2019t focus properly because every time you see a Twitter notification, you derail. You don\u2019t really feel entitled to carve out this much time for yourself. Sure, it\u2019s OK when it\u2019s just November, but . . .\nThere is no one-size-fits-all to answer to this. There is, however, networking, researching, seeking the support of your peers, sympathetic brainstorming and\u2014most importantly\u2014experimentation. There are a lot of things writers have tried. As you sit there basking in the glow of your 50K manuscript, take up your search engine and scan a bunch of those \u201cHow to find time to write\u201d articles on the web. Keep browsing until you find five possibilities that might work for you.\nHunt for the answer. Morning writing? Evening writing? White noise apps? Working on pen and paper? Pomodoro? Experiment for as long as you need. Don\u2019t be afraid to fail for a week because you tried something that seemed stupid.\nPerhaps most importantly, ignore the \u201cshoulds.\u201d It\u2019s wrong to say that everyone should write every day. Not everyone can or should generate steady word counts. There are people who research and outline a book for nine months and then hole up in a motel and write the draft in 3 weeks. I read about someone like that in Writer\u2019s Digest when I was 16. That writer, to me, was as improbable as the Organians. The thing is, that guy did the same thing again the next year. And again, the next.\nMe? I go to a coffee shop every morning with my writing kit, and the fact that I then feel I have to earn back the cost of my pricey espresso is what it takes to buckle me down to fiction. It\u2019s no weirder than anyone else\u2019s strategy, and I have hundreds of thousands of words under my belt. Coffee shop writing is, somehow, the Alien who makes me do it.\nMake a little time to figure out your long game, if you can, while your draft is still hot. Do the experiments and learn what your brain requires. Be kind to yourself, be forgiving . . . but you want to write, and you\u2019re allowed to want to write . . . so don\u2019t let yourself wriggle off the hook.\nImagine, as you try things, that those pesky interfering aliens are coming for you. They want your next book (and your next, and your next!) and they are going to make you write. They\u2019ve taken Ensign Chekov hostage. They\u2019ve got one of those creepy Khan worms.\nIf you had to write a book every year, for improbable alien threat reasons, if you had to establish a regular artistic practice, what would be in your way? How could you get it out of your way?\nGo boldly now and find the answer.\nA.M. Dellamonica's first novel, Indigo Springs, won the Sunburst Award for Canadian Literature of the Fantastic.

I have the UTranslator app on my phone, and before I left my colleague Jeanine said that it had worked fine for her. But she\u2019d also said she\u2019d never had trouble finding an English speaker in China. And her trips were to Shanghai and Beijing.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to the Guizhou province,\u201d I\u2019d said.\n \u201cWhere?\u201d she said, pulling out her phone to look up a map.\n \u201cLike the Oklahoma of China,\u201d I said. Southern-ish, rural, inland, poor. Not where the foreign tourists usually go.\n At the baggage claim, there\u2019s a yellow lab sniffing bags, trotting happily back and forth along the conveyor belt as it snakes into the airport. The dog looks deeply pleased with his work, and I am startled to see him sit down on the belt next to a suitcase, which is the standard signal dogs give when they\u2019re flagging something. I look around, wondering if I\u2019m about to see an arrest. No one seems perturbed. Also, no one claims the bag; a short time later it winds past me and I see that its wheels are wrapped and it has no handle. The suitcase is a decoy, riding the belt endlessly to give the dog something to react to on days with no would-be smugglers. I wonder what they put inside it.\n My suitcase elicits no response from the dog. I\u2019m irrationally relieved.\n In Guiyang, the responses from the UTranslator app get me a lot of very confused looks unless I keep it to single-word requests. \u201cBathroom?\u201d gets me pointed in the right direction. \u201cNewspaper?\u201d gets me to a newsstand. Of course, all the papers for sale are in Chinese and I can\u2019t tell which are going to be filled with news from Beijing and Shanghai and which might have local stories. I buy two papers anyway.\n \u201cWhere can I hire a car to take me to Danzhai?\u201d is not a successful sort of query but \u201ctaxi?\u201d eventually gets me to the right spot. It takes time to make it clear that I really do want to go all the way to Danzhai (it\u2019s two-and-a-half hours away), but we finally set off.\n I didn\u2019t sleep well on the plane, and I very much want to sleep in the car, but I\u2019m too keyed up. I stare out at the wide smooth highway that tunnels straight through the hills and bridges the valleys, trying to catch glimpses of China beyond the guardrails, barely absorbing anything.\n All I want from the newspapers is the answer to one question: have there been any more bodies? I hover my phone over the characters, slowly parsing out headlines about trade agreements, a train accident, a pair of extremely old identical twins who are celebrating their birthday.\n \u201cWhy are you going to Guizhou?\u201d Jeanine had asked.\n \u201cBecause no one I know has ever been there,\u201d I said. This was a lie. I\u2019m here to find Andrew.\n I met Andrew my sophomore year of high school.\n I was a nerd, which back in the 1980s was the actual opposite of cool (as opposed to now, when it\u2019s simply another variety of it). I spent middle school being bullied for my preference for books over people and sweatpants over jeans. Any time I stopped for a drink from the water fountain, my classmates would yank my pants down; the school administrators all insisted that if I just ignored them instead of crying, this would stop. When I started high school, I caved and started wearing blue jeans, even though I hated the way the waistband dug into my sides when I sat.\n Freshman year of high school, I spent my lunch periods eating with a few girls I called my friends, who\u2019d more-or-less tolerated me in middle school. Sometimes we hung out on weekends at the mall, where the other girls would coo over \u201cadorable\u201d clothing and I\u2019d self-consciously stroke the scratchy fabric and pretend I wished my mother would give me a clothing allowance instead of just buying me the same L.L.Bean turtlenecks again and again because she knew they had soft tags and I\u2019d wear them.\n Andrew was in both my chemistry class and my precalculus class, and he noticed that I spent a big part of the day reading books under my desk. He started asking me each morning what I\u2019d brought to read. Initially I wasn\u2019t sure whether his curious tone was the fake-curious voice other kids sometimes used right before they turned into complete assholes. After multiple classes passed and he didn\u2019t snatch my books away to wipe a booger on them or anything like that, I started feeling a bit less wary. My books were all science fiction, and all came from my neighborhood library, which mostly meant Isaac Asimov, Piers Anthony, and all the older Anne McCaffrey.\n \u201cYou should read this,\u201d Andrew said one day, and handed me a paperback. \u201cIt\u2019s mine. Don\u2019t crack the spine. You\u2019ll like it.\u201d\n It was a copy of Neuromancer by William Gibson. The next day, I sat with him at lunch.\n Danzhai Wanda Tourist Village is possibly the strangest place I\u2019ve ever been.\n Everything around me looks quaint and old, but in fact it was built from scratch just a few years ago to showcase local ethnic cultures and attract tourists to the area. Local people are employed to wear traditional costumes, walk the street playing traditional instruments, make and sell traditional crafts. It reminds me of a Renaissance festival.\n Many of the women in traditional clothing are wearing silver hats with delicately formed butterflies on the top and a jingly fringe right above their eyes. Other women wear their long hair scraped up high into something almost like a bouffant, but with silver ornaments and oversized flowers pinned in. They wear beautifully embroidered jackets and skirts, and silver belts, and large silver necklaces that look like someone cut a circle and hammered the silver out into a crescent. Everything jingles as they move. I wonder if the metal jewelry is heavy, if the clothing is uncomfortable, how much is prescribed, and how much is left up to them.\n The men and women minding the shops are mostly wearing more ordinary clothes, although a few have the hairstyle with a smaller ornament pinned in. I can\u2019t tell whether the tourists shopping in the stores are from other parts of China, or just other parts of Guizhou.\n UTranslate doesn\u2019t work any better here than at the airport. Fortunately, the hotel has a sign in English over the door telling me it\u2019s a hotel, and \u201cRoom?\u201d is easy enough to understand.\n I know I\u2019m not going to find Andrew today. It\u2019s going to take time. Today my job is to check into the hotel, not nap, and adjust to the time change. This would all be easier if I\u2019d arrived in early evening rather than midmorning. I resolutely leave my suitcase on the bed instead of lying down myself and go back outside.\n At the end of the street there\u2019s a public square, and three young women have set up a table with carved drinking horns and little bowls of what I\u2019m pretty sure is a potent alcoholic beverage. Two have the silver hats; the third has the hair ornaments. They are beckoning visitors over and feeding people the drink out of the horns. I am quickly jostled up to the front, where one of the women smiles and sings a song as she pours the drink into my mouth.\n You could poison a lot of people this way I think as I swallow obediently and then wonder what sort of person I am to even think such a thing. The alcohol is strong, and I hope it\u2019s not rude if I stop drinking. The ladies don\u2019t stop smiling when I pull my head back, so if I\u2019m being rude, they\u2019re too polite to mention it.\n I like meeting new people, one of the affirmations they made me repeat back when I went to therapy years ago, pops into my head. \u201cXie xie,\u201d I say, the one word of Chinese I know: thank you.\n \u201cThank you,\u201d I said to Andrew when I gave him back the book. \u201cIt was great.\u201d I\u2019d brought along one of my own paperbacks to lend him, one I\u2019d bought on my own rather than checking it out from the library\u2014Startide Rising.\n \u201cIf you used a bookmark instead of putting your books facedown they\u2019d last longer,\u201d he told me when he finished it.\n \u201cSometimes I dog-ear the pages,\u201d I said.\n \u201cYou do realize that makes you an actual monster.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s my book! I can fold down corners if I want!\u201d Sometimes I\u2019d fold down corners just so I could easily get back to a particular page to reread it. I didn\u2019t tell Andrew that I occasionally even did that with library books. Just the older library books I checked out again and again, though\u2014especially the story collections from the bottom shelf. Not the new books.\n Andrew had a girlfriend, a goth girl named Nadine who went to the other school, and she had a whole cluster of nerdy friends. Suddenly on the weekends I had something to do, and when Star Trek IV came out I had people to see it with. Since none of us had much money, we spent most of our weekend afternoons haunting local parks or the family rooms of the kids with more absent parents. Having an entire group of friends was a shocking novelty to me. The friends I\u2019d had before were willing to put up with how weird I was. Never before had I had friends who were weird with me.\n Andrew was my closest friend in the group: he loaned me books and comics, made movie recommendations. I rented Alien on video because he\u2019d recommended it so highly. Also Blade Runner. He was brilliant but lazy, sliding by with adequate grades because he didn\u2019t want to do the work. \u201cHigh school is pointless,\u201d he said. \u201cI already know everything they\u2019re telling us. There will actually be things for me to learn once I get to college.\u201d\n There were a lot of on-again off-again romances in the group\u2014two kids would get together, spend a couple of weekends holding hands (or making out while the rest of us yelled \u201cget a room!\u201d), amicably break up.\n When Andrew and Nadine broke up, Nadine disappeared from the group.\n Months later, I ran into Nadine waiting tables at a diner near the U. I was by myself, with a stack of books and homework and $10 for bottomless coffee and a big plate of fries. \u201cNadine!\u201d I said, delighted, when she came to my table. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever!\u201d\n \u201cOh, hi,\u201d she said, giving me a faint smile. \u201cYeah, guess it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\n \u201cHow are you? I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d\n \u201cYou have? Huh, okay.\u201d She took out her pad. \u201cI\u2019m actually working, so . . . do you know what you want?\u201d\n I gave her my order and let her take my menu and tried to shake off my hurt feelings. She was busy; I was a customer; I didn\u2019t want to be a pest. I spread out my Spanish vocabulary cards and worked on them as I dipped fries into ketchup one by one and ate them, flipping them around so I didn\u2019t double-dip even though I was the only one at the table. She came around twice to refill my coffee and water, not making eye contact, and finally stopped, my mug still in her hand, and said, \u201cAre you still hanging out with Andrew?\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, a little hesitant. He had a new girlfriend. Was she jealous? Was that what this was about? I wasn\u2019t the one dating him. I wasn\u2019t into him that way.\n \u201cYou know he has a dead rabbit in his freezer? Or did. He was going to dissect it.\u201d\n Nadine clearly expected a response, but my main question was, was she saying he killed the rabbit or did he just find a dead one, because . . . I mean, we cut up animals in advanced biology. They were from a supply house, of course, not picked up off the street, but . . . I didn\u2019t know how disturbed to be about the whole idea.\n \u201cHe wanted me to watch,\u201d Nadine added.\n \u201cUgh,\u201d I said, sympathetically.\n \u201cHe talked about wanting to know what everything looks like on the inside. Everything. Just . . . I don\u2019t know, Cecily. Be careful, I guess.\u201d\n \u201cIs that why you disappeared?\u201d I asked.\n She gave me a look that I couldn\u2019t identify. Pity? Exasperation? \u201cYeah, Cecily,\u201d she said, flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s why I disappeared. Do you need anything else or should I bring you the check?\u201d\n I had been planning to get a slice of pie, but there was something about Nadine\u2019s glare that made me antsy. I decided to just go. \u201cCheck,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n She took my money up to the register and brought me the change. \u201cKeep it,\u201d I said.\n \u201cThanks,\u201d she said, and put the change in her apron. And then stood there, chewing on her lip and staring at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be alone with him,\u201d she blurted out, finally, as I started to gather up my books.\n \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n \u201cYou just don\u2019t want to be alone with him. Trust me.\u201d\n I\u2019d been alone with him dozens of times, and nothing bad had ever happened to me. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, not arguing. \u201cThanks.\u201d\n I didn\u2019t tell Andrew I\u2019d run into Nadine. The next time I wanted to get French fries and coffee and a booth to do homework while I was near the U, I chose a different diner.\n To order in the Danzhai restaurants, I point at things other people are eating. I have a whole roast fish, still on the bone, in a rich sauce; I have eggplant with ground pork in a sauce that runs red with chilies and oil; I have plates of some sort of green vegetable that looks vaguely like turnip greens but with florets.\n Dozens of vegetables came from the same wild herb, Brassica oleracea; we selected for flowers to get broccoli, buds to get brussels sprouts, leaves to get cabbage, roots to get kohlrabi. If this is Chinese broccoli, which seems likely, that\u2019s yet another cultivar of the same plant. I wonder how long it takes to go from B. oleracea to ornamental kale through old-fashioned trait selection. I eat it with chopsticks, thinking about what steps I\u2019d go through to get from ornamental kale to cauliflower in a day, using gene editing. Leaves, flowers, color, roots . . . I wonder how much I\u2019d forget to do, what the results would be. I can\u2019t think of any new B. oleracea cultivars that gene editing has brought us\u2014maybe because we already had every variation that seemed like a good idea to anyone, developed the old-fashioned way.\n We\u2019ve always done this, some shadow in my mind whispers. I shake off the thought.\n When I eat at the hotel, I get the same waitress again and again, not because she speaks English but because she\u2019s a little less easily frustrated by a customer who doesn\u2019t speak any Chinese. \u201cYou should just bring me something you think I\u2019ll like,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m not fussy.\u201d UTranslate balks at this, so I try the word \u201canything,\u201d and then \u201cyou choose for me,\u201d with an expansive gesture.\n She brings me out a soup, with fish chunks bobbing in it and slices of tomato in a rich red broth. \u201cPerfect,\u201d I say, and she smiles back, clearly pleased with my reaction. A little while later she brings out a glass of black tea. The tea farm is somewhere near here, and I can see the leaves unfurling in the water like those children\u2019s toys that go from a tiny little capsule to a full-sized giraffe-shaped sponge when you drop them in water.\n There is a theater in the tourist village that hosts a daily performance reenacting the legend of the Golden Pheasant Girl. This is apparently a well-known local legend. There\u2019s a statue outside of a woman mid-transformation, and on a hill nearby there\u2019s a metal statue of a golden bird. Actual male golden pheasants are very showy, with feathers shading yellow to gold to red. The females are the dull brown of most girl birds.\n I buy a ticket to the show. They gesture for me to wait and spend five minutes digging out an English-language program that includes a summary of what I\u2019m about to watch.\n The buildings here are mostly unheated, and the theater is as cold as everywhere else. There\u2019s a handy little plastic clapper on each armrest, though, so I can use that to applaud while keeping my gloves on.\n The stage itself has video screens built into the sides and along the back, which they use for some of the theatrical magic. There\u2019s a lot of dance and song, puppetry, smoke effects. In the story, the people flee the losing side of a war, crossing a giant river, and resettle somewhere that they are safe but have no food. There\u2019s a beautiful wedding sequence and then both the man and the women leave to seek out a magical tree that gives the seeds of every known plant.\n In the staging, the tree is silver and resembles the hats the women here wear; I\u2019m not sure if those hats are supposed to symbolize the tree or vice versa because the program doesn\u2019t tell me. Both the man and the woman reach the tree and are told that one of them will be given the gift of the seeds but the other will be demanded as a sacrifice.\n Both try to be the sacrifice; the man is pushed back as the woman\u2019s sacrifice is accepted. She ascends to the back center of the backdrop and then raises her arms to be transformed into wings; lights, video, and flying wires are used to change her into the golden pheasant for the performance, although she looks rather more like a phoenix. The man, temporarily forgotten, regains the spotlight as she flies away and he\u2019s blown back by the wind from her wings. Weeping, he takes the seeds back to his people.\n I find myself thinking about how you would transform a human woman into a golden pheasant with gene editing and wrench my thoughts away from that particular abyss. Instead, the ballet over, I find a shop in Danzhai that has newspapers and buy another stack, then take them back to my room and spread them out on my bed to hunt through for stories about bodies. This time I find one, but it\u2019s a domestic murder-suicide in Xi\u2019an and nothing about it sounds particularly mysterious. I wonder how much I\u2019m missing just from UTranslate\u2019s obstinacy.\n Combing through newspapers fills me with tension because it\u2019s simultaneously passive and time-consuming. The whole trip is like that: passive and time-consuming, and I\u2019m on edge, and don\u2019t know what to do. They were so confident that Andrew would seek me out, if I came. I am less and less sure that they were right.\n When I check my e-mail one last time before I go to bed, I have an e-mail from a mysterious address that says, Just like the story, sometimes sacrifice is required, Cecily, if everyone else is to survive.\n I reply immediately: \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n \u201cAndrew? Andrew!\u201d\n We were at Andrew\u2019s house, in the family room, watching a James Bond movie. I remember it was a James Bond movie, but not which movie. His mother stormed in and furiously shut off the TV. \u201cA C?\u201d she snapped. \u201cA C minus?\u201d\n \u201cI guess my report card came,\u201d he said, staring out the window and not looking at either his mother or at me.\n \u201cIf you would just do the homework and turn it in\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI already know everything that\u2019s on the homework. They want me to do the same problem 40 times in a row until I die from tedium.\u201d\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry your schoolwork does not hold your interest,\u201d his mother snapped, \u201cbut my job is not one hundred percent intellectually stimulating, either, and if I decided to just never go to boring meetings I would be fired.\u201d\n Andrew\u2019s family was Chinese, but Chinese American for a number of generations. He liked to describe his mother as a grades-obsessed dragon lady. Even though I was generally on Andrew\u2019s side, I knew this wasn\u2019t fair. When it came to grades, his mother was basically exactly like my mother. My mom threw a fit when I let my grades slip in middle school. (I was trying to fit in. It didn\u2019t work.)\n \u201cWhat is it going to take to get you to work up to your potential?\u201d his mom demanded. \u201cOr at least in the near vicinity of your potential? The same metropolitan area as your potential?\u201d\n \u201cMaybe classes that weren\u2019t so boring,\u201d Andrew mumbled. \u201cI need to walk Cecily home, I\u2019ll be back in a few.\u201d I finished gathering up my coat and Andrew slipped out the door after me.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, uselessly, as we walked back to my house, six blocks away.\n \u201cNot your thing to be sorry for,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom is my mom. I\u2019ll never be the kid she wanted.\u201d\n I thought about that as we walked, whether I was the kid my parents had wanted. The summer I was ten, my father tried to get me to learn to play tennis. He took me to the tennis court on the weekends and he signed me up for classes. I went to the classes and swung my racket and practiced with my father and remained absolutely terrible at tennis. At the end of the summer he let me quit. Would he have preferred a kid who was good at tennis? Probably, actually. But he didn\u2019t yell at me about it. He gave away my racket and never brought it up again.\n Possibly my mother would have liked a girl who liked wearing uncomfortable pretty clothing. When I was little she would buy me dresses made from stiff, crunchy fabrics with lace on them. I remembered one enormous fight when I was eight: she\u2019d wanted me to dress up for a family wedding. Her promises of wedding cake and a Shirley Temple children\u2019s cocktail got me as far as the car; when I started crying and asking to turn around because the seams itched, she swore that if I just ignored the itching, it would go away. This was a lie, just like with teasing. When we got to the church, I sat down sobbing on the big stone steps leading to the front door and refused to go inside. My father wound up taking me home.\n There was a park about halfway between my house and Andrew\u2019s house, a weird little former quarry with a stone formation called a \u201ccouncil ring\u201d that looked like a good place to hold a very outdoorsy meeting, or possibly sacrifice a goat since there was a big stone in the middle. We sat down on the low stone wall of the ring. Andrew smoked a clove cigarette, which his mother would have been even more furious about than his grades.\n \u201cSorry we didn\u2019t get to finish the movie.\u201d\n \u201cI can kind of guess how it went.\u201d\n \u201cSure, but we missed some good action sequences.\u201d\n I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal. Are you going to be OK when you get home?\u201d\n \u201cThere\u2019ll be a lot more yelling, but it\u2019ll stop once I tell her I\u2019ll work harder in school, which of course I won\u2019t, but she won\u2019t know that.\u201d\n I laughed. Andrew always made me laugh.\n \u201cI think you\u2019re the only person who understands me,\u201d he said.\n \u201cI feel the same way,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, that you\u2019re the only person who understands me, not that I\u2019m the only person who understands you.\u201d\n \u201cI knew what you meant.\u201d\n \u201cWell, that stands to reason, right?\u201d\n I was angry at his mother, and a little bit at him\u2014would it actually kill him to do his homework?\u2014and I felt awkward and embarrassed at having seen the fight, but the conversation at the council ring felt like a grace note in the day, anyway.\n \u201cSay, do you think you could let me copy the precalculus homework?\u201d Andrew asked. \u201cIn the mornings, before we go to class? Just to get my mother off my back. I don\u2019t care about my grades.\u201d\n \u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cNo problem.\u201d\n In the morning, my e-mail has an e-mail from a friend back in the US asking if I\u2019m going to see the Great Wall of China while I\u2019m here. I send back a note offering probably-too-much explanation of Chinese geography: I am currently as far from the Great Wall of China as she is from the Grand Canyon. She lives in Portland, Oregon. If someone came to visit her in Portland, would she suggest they hit the Grand Canyon while they were there? China, like the US, is very big. I look at my block of text, delete it, and say, \u201cit would be about a 17-hour drive from where I am. So, no.\u201d\n There\u2019s nothing from Andrew. I go downstairs for breakfast and load up my plate with two fried eggs and four of the Chinese-style steamed rolls, baozi. I spot a fellow westerner across the room; he\u2019s the first white person I\u2019ve seen since I arrived in Danzhai. He looks either jet lagged or extremely hungover. Possibly both.\n After I\u2019ve finished breakfast I check my e-mail again and debate whether to send another message to the mystery address. I decide it\u2019s a little too soon and go out to walk around Danzhai again.\n I brought Chinese currency with me\u2014a stack of pink bills with Mao smiling benignly on them. Mao is a lot less popular in China than he once was, but he\u2019s still on the money. I suppose this is also true of George Washington in the US. Anyway, having brought money, it seems reasonable to spend some.\n I like the long, quilted coats that the clothing stores are selling, and the fabric is soft, but they\u2019re all sewn for smaller women with narrower shoulders than I have. Even the vests don\u2019t fit me properly. I admire a jointed silver fish at a jewelry store, embroidered purses, handmade bird cages that are lovely and interesting but would be very difficult to get home. They do batik here, all dyed in a blue dye that\u2019s almost the same shade as denim, and I buy a batik tablecloth.\n At that night\u2019s dinner at the hotel, the other westerner is looking less hungover and catches my eye. \u201cJoin me?\u201d he invites, in British-accented English. I pull up a chair across from him. \u201cI\u2019m Tom Lewis.\u201d\n \u201cCecily,\u201d I say, and we shake hands.\n \u201cWhat brings you to Danzhai?\u201d\n \u201cI could ask you the same question. I wanted to go somewhere unusual, somewhere no one I knew had ever been.\u201d\n \u201cYou picked well, then. I\u2019m a travel writer. Not sure if I\u2019m going to write up this place or not; it\u2019s a bit of a bore.\u201d\n I bristle instinctively, even though I haven\u2019t found what I\u2019m looking for. \u201cWhat do you find interesting?\u201d\n He rattles off a dozen cities I\u2019ve never been to and tells me about the night life in Kuala Lumpur. I think he\u2019s trying to impress me. I wonder if he tries to impress everyone he meets, or just women, or just white women? He snaps his fingers at the waitress and I cringe, worried that the waitress is going to think that we\u2019re together. He orders something in Chinese and says to me, \u201cwhat are you having?\u201d\n I tell him I\u2019d like the whole fish, and he translates that into Chinese for me.\n \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t UTranslate work here?\u201d I ask.\n \u201cThe makers are having some sort of fight with China\u2019s Great Firewall,\u201d he says. \u201cYou should\u2019ve come last week, the problem it\u2019s having is new.\u201d\n \u201cIs there another app that will work?\u201d\n \u201cThe official Chinese app is having some sort of dispute with the keepers of the app store, so no. What is it you\u2019re planning to do tomorrow? Perhaps I can be of assistance.\u201d\n What I want to say is, I\u2019d rather get by with a Chinese-English paper dictionary from the 1980s than drag along someone who snaps his fingers at waitstaff but I never actually have the guts to be quite that confrontational, so I just laugh awkwardly and say nothing.\n \u201cHave you gone to see the prison?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cThe what?\u201d I say, not entirely certain I\u2019ve heard correctly.\n \u201cThere\u2019s a former mercury mine about a half hour from here. It\u2019s been used as a movie set a few times. There\u2019s an abandoned town to one side, an abandoned prison to the other. Hire a driver and you can give yourself a tour. I mean, you\u2019ll have to get out once you\u2019re there. The roads are all overgrown. It\u2019s picturesque, if you like that sort of thing. My friend Percival Abbot\u2014you might know of him?\u2014did a photography exhibition on it a few months back.\u201d\n Our food arrives and we have an awkward meal together. I have not heard of Percival Abbot, although a quick Internet search when Tom steps away from the table confirms he is, in fact, a photographer whose website telegraphs that I really should have heard of him.\n \u201cAre you thinking of going to soak in the spa later?\u201d Tom asks as we\u2019re finishing dinner.\n \u201cNo,\u201d I say, even though I immediately think, Spa? I don\u2019t really want Tom\u2019s uninvited company.\n \u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I said to Marc, the boy who\u2019d just gotten in the lunch line behind me.\n \u201cAs I\u2019d want to, Fartknocker.\u201d My last name was Grantz; how this got turned into \u201cFartknocker\u201d by my tormenters was a mystery to me.\n I felt his hand on my ass as I raised my tray so the lunch server could put my food on it. I flushed hot with fury. \u201cI told you not to touch me,\u201d I said.\n \u201cI didn\u2019t. Maybe your clothes want to flee your foul body, Fartknocker.\u201d\n I had pulled the tray down and was holding it in front of me; at that, I whirled, turned it sideways, and hurled French fries, hamburger, and the tray into his sneering face.\n My mother came to pick me up from the principal\u2019s office, looking harried and frustrated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d she said as I followed her down the stairs and out to the car. \u201cYou need to stop letting people get your goat. He just wanted a reaction from you and he got one, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n Also grease and ketchup all over his shirt, and maybe that would discourage him from tormenting me where ignoring him hadn\u2019t? I burst into tears, because that was what I always did when I got angry enough, and said, \u201cI wish I\u2019d kicked him in the balls.\u201d\n \u201cDon\u2019t do that, either,\u201d Mom said. \u201cYour grades are really good, Cecily, but if you\u2019ve got a serious disciplinary record it\u2019s going to be hard for you to get into college.\u201d\n Andrew came over after school, since Mom had said I was grounded but hadn\u2019t said I wasn\u2019t allowed to have visitors. \u201cBoys are the worst,\u201d I said.\n \u201cFootball players are the worst,\u201d he corrected.\n \u201cDoes Marc play football?\u201d I never knew who played what. It just wasn\u2019t interesting enough to keep track of.\n \u201cProbably.\u201d\n \u201cI hope he gets hit by a bus.\u201d\n \u201cYeah, about that. We\u2019ve got to talk about your technique, Cecily. Throwing a tray is very showy and all but it wasn\u2019t going to do any real damage. You have to hit people like that where it hurts.\u201d\n \u201cDo you think I should have kicked him in the nuts, instead?\u201d\n \u201cTesticles are actually a smaller target than most people think. No, revenge is a dish best served cold.\u201d\n We talked for hours about things we could do to Marc: laxatives in his food, stink bombs in his locker or slipped into the pocket of his letterman\u2019s jacket, infect him with head lice. None of these ideas were particularly practical: we didn\u2019t have access to his food, we didn\u2019t know of anyone with an active case of head lice, he\u2019d certainly notice if either of us slipped a stink bomb into his pocket. That was fine, though. Revenge, for me, was a dish best imagined and never served up at all. If I was going to do anything, it would be a hurled tray in a moment of anger, not a carefully crafted boutique-quality revenge plot.\n Andrew got roughed up, a few weeks later, supposedly for looking at another boy in the locker room for a few seconds too long when they were changing after gym class. It was Marc with one of his teammates.\n \u201cThe frustrating thing,\u201d he confided, \u201cis that even if I can get laxatives into his food, he won\u2019t know why he\u2019s being punished. He\u2019ll just think he\u2019s eaten something that disagreed with him. I wish I could hit him back hard enough in the moment to make him sorry he\u2019d messed with me.\u201d\n \u201cYou could learn a martial art, maybe.\u201d Thanks to the success of the Karate Kid movie there were about 8 million karate schools in our town alone.\n \u201cUnlike in the movies,\u201d Andrew said, \u201cyou have to take classes for years before you\u2019re actually any good. Also, I\u2019m pretty sure if you beat someone up at school they\u2019ll kick you out, even if they richly deserved it.\u201d\n \u201cAlso, if you\u2019ve got a serious disciplinary record it could keep you out of college,\u201d I said, like my mother had.\n Andrew sighed. \u201cAll I want is to make the people who deserve to suffer, suffer,\u201d he said. \u201cIs that really so much to ask?\u201d\n Two weeks after that, Marc\u2019s car, sitting in the student parking lot, went up in flames. No one seemed to know what had caused it. I asked Andrew if it was him, and he raised his eyebrows and said \u201cwhatever would make you think that?\u201d instead of answering. And he was right: if it was him, Marc had no idea why he\u2019d been punished.\n The spa, it turns out, is in a separate building from the hotel, and I have to go out into the street to get there. Once I\u2019m there, the attendant checks my room key, then shows me a locker room with complimentary slippers that are barely half the size of my feet. I change into my bathing suit and venture out the far door.\n There are two pools, steam rising from the water. The website mentioned a hot spring. I wonder if this is actually spring water, or if they heat it somewhere and pipe it in? I\u2019m a little shocked by just how hot the water is; initially it\u2019s too hot to immerse myself in, so I stick just my feet in the water and then ease the rest of myself in as I adjust to it.\n There\u2019s a button you can press to turn the soaking pool into a whirlpool, and I try it. The bubbles are nice but the noise is a little like sitting next to a blender. I decide to just soak.\n Somewhere out there is Andrew. He knows I\u2019m here. He knows I want to find him. I imagine him striding into the spa, right now, as unlikely as that is. What would I say to him?\n How did I ever believe that I knew you?\n Instead, it\u2019s Tom who strolls in. \u201cOh, hello,\u201d he says. \u201cI heard you changed your mind! Isn\u2019t the water nice?\u201d\n I sigh and make a noncommittal, non-conversational sort of noise, hoping he\u2019ll take the hint and settle into the other pool. He climbs into mine, of course, and sits down next to me.\n \u201cWhat do you mean that you heard I changed my mind?\u201d I ask, since apparently conversation is inevitable.\n \u201cI asked at the front desk where the other westerner had headed. You\u2019re rather conspicuous, my dear.\u201d\n \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d\n He prattles on for a while about some beach in Thailand that\u2019s so popular with British tourists there are more white people there than Thai people, and then moves on to the question of authenticity and whether that\u2019s something you should even be trying to seek out. I smile and nod, which is all he seems to particularly want from me.\n At least, it\u2019s all he wants from me until he scoots in closer and suggests we go out for a drink. I rocket out of the pool like the water has suddenly turned to acid, and retreat to my hotel room, with its locked door.\n It\u2019s not until I get there that I wonder if he\u2019s not a travel writer. If he\u2019s actually here for the same reason I am. If he\u2019s looking for Andrew.\n The summer after my sophomore year of college, I had a research fellowship to work with a biochemistry professor there. I\u2019d gone to a small, highly competitive, intensely nerdy college. It felt like I\u2019d spent my whole life up to that point as a fish out of water, leaping from jar to cup to puddle in a desperate bid to stay alive, and suddenly I\u2019d found my way to the ocean. To water, to other fish, to the place I\u2019d always belonged but never had been able to find. That was college, for me.\n Not so much for Andrew. He\u2019d applied to that same college, but he hadn\u2019t gotten in. He hadn\u2019t initially gotten into the flagship state university, either; his grades were too low. He\u2019d enrolled at the local community college, then transferred to the state university after a year. He was doing okay, but he had big classes, few friends, professors who were unimpressed by his estimation of himself.\n I visited home for just two weeks at the end of the summer. Andrew and I met up at a local park and he told me stories about his summer working at the local pool. He\u2019d gotten lifeguard certification but, he told me cheerfully, he was probably the world\u2019s worst lifeguard, using his dark sunglasses to conceal naps.\n \u201cWhat if someone actually gets into trouble?\u201d I said.\n \u201cThey\u2019d better yell loud enough to wake me up, then,\u201d Andrew said in a cheerful tone.\n People who are drowning can\u2019t yell. They have water in their lungs; that\u2019s literally what drowning means. I didn\u2019t want to scold him. Surely no one had actually died on his watch, or I\u2019d have heard. Also, I was never certain when he was joking. I forced a laugh, told myself this was definitely a joke, and described the research fellowship a bit. We were doing DNA sequencing, using one of the first automated machines for that purpose; I was studying the genome of a bacteria that mostly just lives harmlessly on human skin but can on occasion cause raging infections of various kinds, or food poisoning. I found the fact that it could be harmless or deadly really fascinating. It took me longer than it probably should have to realize that Andrew was a lot less interested than I was.\n \u201cYou really are a nerd,\u201d he said, finally. I wasn\u2019t sure I was right that I was hearing contempt in his voice\u2014I mean, this was Andrew. My best friend. My best friend from high school, anyway. I\u2019d told him earlier about Beth, my best friend in college, who grew up in Arkansas and liked to crochet mathematical forms. I\u2019d brought along a yarn stellated rhombic dodecahedron she\u2019d made me for my birthday. I wondered if I should show that to Andrew, like I\u2019d planned, or if that would make him angrier. More contemptuous.\n What\u2019s wrong with me, I thought, and then I thought, there\u2019s nothing wrong with me. The problem here is him. He\u2019s acting like an asshole.\n I made some excuses and left.\n We didn\u2019t talk for twenty years.\n Genetics became my life\u2019s work. Sequencing, first, through my undergraduate years and the beginning of graduate school. Genetic engineering, starting midway through graduate school and continuing through my postdoctoral work and my years at the university. CRISPR, when CRISPR became available, was just one more tool, but a particularly fascinating one. My focus was genetic diseases in humans.\n There are basically two approaches to genetic diseases. The first is to test people\u2014this has gotten cheaper and easier every year\u2014and discourage carriers from having genetic children with other carriers. If one parent carries the gene for cystic fibrosis, but the other doesn\u2019t, none of their children will have the disease. The problem with this approach is that because carriers will continue to have children with noncarriers, the genes themselves stay in the population and at least a few babies with genetic diseases are more or less inevitable. (Please note, I\u2019m not talking about eliminating neurodiversity from the population, or anything that could possibly be a reasonable human variation. I\u2019m talking about diseases that cause years of misery and an inevitable early death, like cystic fibrosis, or diseases that just kill any child unlucky enough to have them, like Tay-Sachs.) The second approach is to step into the genome with the tools we have and simply fix it. If we use something like CRISPR to edit an embryo\u2019s genome, we can not only ensure that the child born from that embryo will not have Tay-Sachs or cystic fibrosis, we can ensure that they will also not grow up to pass along that particular gene.\n Using techniques like this on humans beyond the embryo stage is years away. Or at least, I assumed it was years away.\n Andrew got back in touch through Facebook. When I friended him back, he sent me a private message\u2014CECILY, wow, when I found out your family had moved out of town I thought I\u2019d never catch up with you again. What are you up to these days?\n I\u2019m a professor at Johns Hopkins, and Andrew was a lot more enthusiastic about my work now than the last time we talked, which was reassuring; he\u2019d matured, clearly. And we\u2019d both grown up; I was no longer the angry, insecure girl I\u2019d been at that point in my life. I\u2019d found my place in the world a long time ago.\n We started chatting regularly again. Andrew told me about his job at a biotech start-up. It had taken him a lot longer to get through college and it didn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d gotten through a doctoral program, but skills count for more outside of academia and he\u2019d always had an abundance of intelligence and creativity. He\u2019d signed a nondisclosure agreement, he said. As head researcher at a university lab, I had not.\n \u201cI would give anything to see that paper you\u2019re working on,\u201d he said one day, after I\u2019d told him about the research I was doing into whether gene-editing technology\u2014not CRISPR, but I\u2019d started with CRISPR\u2014could be used beyond the embryonic stage.\n I sent it to him.\n When the FBI agent came to my lab, I assumed she was looking for my colleague Jeanine, who developed a process for recovering DNA from centuries-old bones. She was not. \u201cDr. Cecily Grantz?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you have a few minutes?\u201d\n I looked at the clock on my desk and said, \u201cI have a class to teach later today, but not until 2 PM. How can I help you?\u201d\n She closed my door, and pulled up a chair, like a student looking for help with a confusing assignment. \u201cI\u2019m Agent Locke,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here to ask you a few questions about someone I think you know.\u201d\n What\u2019s Andrew done, I thought.\n On some level, I must have known all along.\n Agent Locke showed me photos: Andrew\u2019s one-person lab, with a tidy row of molecular printers directly adjacent to a hospital bed with restraint straps dangling down. The home freezer where he kept genetic samples for his record-keeping. And the bodies. The bodies that had torn themselves apart as his serum had wreaked its horrifying havoc. There were many bodies. He\u2019d run test, after test, after test.\n He\u2019d lured in homeless teenagers. Do you need a place to stay? read an e-mail message he\u2019d sent to two dozen separate runaways. I\u2019m here for you.\n There was a video interview with a girl who\u2019d survived, barely. \u201cI was an A-student,\u201d she said in thick speech with a tongue that no longer wanted to cooperate. \u201cMy ex-boyfriend was stalking me. I had no way to protect myself. I wanted to be strong. He promised me this would make me strong.\u201d\n He\u2019d used my research for this. Then adjusted the serum. Improved it. Changed his approach. Found more test subjects.\n Left their bodies in shallow graves.\n Agent Locke wanted to see what I\u2019d sent to Andrew. I gave her everything I had.\n I never knew him, I thought. Not really.\n He was confident in the serum, Agent Locke told me before she left. In the end, he\u2019d used it on himself. It had given him inhuman speed, reflexes, and strength. He\u2019d used them to escape the armed officers who\u2019d come to arrest him. \u201cHe broke their necks,\u201d she said, matter-of-factly, \u201cwith his bare hands.\u201d\n The morning is cold and windy, and I put on extra layers before finding a car to take me to the abandoned mining town.\n The town isn\u2019t entirely abandoned, nor are the residents actually a secret: a clothesline runs across the former town square, with four T-shirts and two pairs of pants drying in the morning air. As I hike up a narrow trail past a four-story apartment building, a dog waits calmly in the doorway of the apartments, not approaching, his tail slowly waving back and forth.\n I think I can guess which buildings have inhabitants just based on where the satellite dishes are and where the glass windows are intact. I follow a trail up the hill. My socks and leggings get covered in tiny burrs; I also spot four patches that have been cleared of weeds and planted with something that might be that B. oleracea cultivar I\u2019ve eaten every night at dinner.\n Back down the hill, near the river, I look over at the rusted wreckage of a very ruined car and step inside what appears to have once been an auditorium.\n If Andrew is here, he\u2019s given no sign.\n The driver takes me through a mine shaft cut straight through the mountain and to the disused prison on the other side. This prison was abandoned in the 1970s, along with the mine; as with the town, there are nonetheless people living here. They grudgingly open up the gates when the driver bangs on the door and yells at them.\n They are using the prison as a chicken farm. The doors to the empty cells all stand empty; inside, they reek of chicken droppings. When I step inside one, a chicken gabbles at me nervously and flaps her way to the other side of the cell, leaving a feather drifting in the air.\n Most of the buildings in this part of China are unheated. Certainly a prison would have been no exception, and the visceral unpleasantness overwhelms me for a moment. I wonder if the prisoners here were criminals, or political prisoners, victims of the Cultural Revolution, who they were.\n I briefly imagine Andrew here.\n It\u2019s what he deserves battles with no one deserves this. I don\u2019t even know what justice would look like after what he\u2019s done.\n Anyway, he\u2019s not here. The longer I stand here the more certain I am that he would never hide in a prison. I can go.\n When I arrive back at Danzhai Village, I can see a crowd gathering on the square outside the performance space: there\u2019s music and dancing. They\u2019re wearing traditional clothes but the music sounds more modern. I walk up for a closer look and get pulled into the dance by a smiling lady with a silver hat. There are choreographed steps that the locals are all following, although tourists who join in are all given enthusiastic encouragement. I feel foreign, heavy-footed, and stupid, but let them egg me on for a few minutes. \u201cGood try!\u201d one of them says in sympathetic English.\n The statue of the Golden Pheasant Girl looms over all of us, lit by little spotlights as the sky grows dark.\n When your people are starving, and the gods or dragons or magical tree demands a sacrifice, you might volunteer yourself; you might race to be the first to volunteer yourself, to spare someone you love.\n I leave the square, walk down to the edge of the river, and think about monsters.\n Nadine tried to tell me. Andrew himself tried to tell me. Did I turn away from these warnings because on some level it felt like being the one person the monster would never harm made me special?\n How sure are you that this will work? Jeanine asked when I told her a little about the plan, when she agreed to keep an eye on my lab when I left for the two-week winter break. What if they\u2019re wrong about whether he values you?\n That\u2019s not why I\u2019ve been dreading finding him. I\u2019m confident he won\u2019t hurt me. I\u2019ve been dreading finding him because I\u2019m here to turn on him. To betray him.\n Because that is what you do when your friend is a monster. Truly a monster\u2014not a part-time monster like a werewolf who can be contained with proper precautions, not a misunderstood monster like the Beast from the fairy tale, but a monster. You don\u2019t defend them. You don\u2019t deny it. You do what you have to do.\n That doesn\u2019t mean you want to do it.\n Back in my room, I pull up my social media and post some pictures I\u2019ve taken: the chickens at the prison, the big empty room in the ghost town that used to be an auditorium. There were some Chinese characters painted in red on the crumbling wall, and now that I\u2019m at my computer I plug that photo into a translation program and find out that the words say \u201cNO SMOKING.\u201d\n Maybe, I think, I\u2019ve looked hard enough. Maybe I can just go home. Tell them I couldn\u2019t find him.\n Then I see the picture I took of the clothesline strung across the village square. There\u2019s a pair of pants hung neatly by the ankles, but for the first time I take a closer look at the shirts. There are six: two work shirts, four T-shirts. The T-shirts have printing on them.\n There\u2019s one with a TARDIS; one with a dragon; one with a math joke.\n He was there. He was there. I just didn\u2019t recognize the signal.\n I lie awake that night for hours, still drawn by that thought I had earlier: I don\u2019t have to go through with this. I could spend another day walking around Danzhai and go home pretending I tried my best. I fall into fitful sleep about halfway through the night, then wake at some very early hour because of a commotion in the hallway outside.\n I put on my glasses, open my door, and step out to see what\u2019s going on.\n A few doors down from mine, a room is open, light spilling out, hotel staff crowding frantically around. One of the women sees me, and she gestures for me to come. She pulls out her phone and speaks into it: it translates her words into flat, British-accented English. \u201cYou speak English. Please tell this man that we have called for a doctor.\u201d\n My door shuts behind me, and my heart pounds as I follow her down the hall.\n In his hotel room, Tom is lying on the floor, writhing in pain. Around him are things the hotel staff have brought to try to help\u2014a kettle of hot water, a bowl of ice, towels, a bottle of pills, a bottle of alcohol. He\u2019s barely conscious. I can see the veins in his forehead bulging out like swollen twigs, the blood inside black and thick. It\u2019s the serum\u2014the unfinished, fatal version. I wonder how Andrew got it into him. I can guess why: I was right. Tom isn\u2019t a \u201ctravel writer,\u201d he came here to find Andrew.\n The staff backs off and lets me speak to him. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s conscious. \u201cThey\u2019ve called an ambulance,\u201d I say. \u201cThey told me to tell you that a doctor is coming.\u201d\n Tom opens his eyes a sliver, looks at me. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to help, is it? It\u2019s not.\u201d His tongue isn\u2019t cooperating; his throat is thick and his voice is raspy.\n There have been some survivors. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be one of them. I don\u2019t want to tell him that, so I ask, \u201cDo you want me to tell anyone where you are?\u201d\n He tries to gesture toward his nightstand. His arm flops to the side. \u201cMy wallet.\u201d\n I take it down and open it. It\u2019s a thin, impersonal wallet\u2014no pictures of children, no coffee shop or grocery store loyalty cards. Just a UK driver\u2019s license, two credit cards, and a wad of cash. Plus a single handwritten index card saying \u201cif found . . . \u201d on it, with an e-mail address and a phone number. \u201cThere,\u201d he whispers.\n \u201cWho\u2019s this going to reach?\u201d I ask.\n He tries to speak, and for a moment can\u2019t. I think I see his lips forming \u201cMI6,\u201d but what comes out, in the end is just, \u201cThey\u2019re no threat to you.\u201d His eyes close and a moment later he starts gasping, the air catching on the edges like burrs on clothing as his throat swells. If he could control his hands he\u2019d be grasping desperately at his throat. I stand up and back away, putting the wallet down on his bed.\n \u201cWhere is the doctor?\u201d I ask the staff, not sure if anyone can understand me. \u201cHe needs a doctor right now or he\u2019s going to die.\u201d\n The ambulance has arrived outside and the Chinese EMTs\u2014or whatever they\u2019re called here\u2014run to Tom\u2019s hotel room. I clear out, give them space to work, and am standing back in my own hotel room as they bring him out a few minutes later. Silent, and covered by a sheet.\n The staff member who frantically brought me to Tom\u2019s side knocks on my door a few minutes later. She has a tray with tea, and sliced melon, and the steamed buns they serve at breakfast. Also a newspaper, because she\u2019s seen me buying newspapers, and I flinch a little at the sight of it. I certainly don\u2019t need that today.\n Her face is tearstained and filled with guilt and shame. I want to reassure her that this catastrophe in her hotel was not her fault, but I don\u2019t want to dig myself into a hole I won\u2019t be able to get out of if anyone comes asking questions, so I say xie xie and let her go.\n Today, the clothesline is empty. I go to the entrance of the building that has the satellite dishes, hand the dog a treat I\u2019ve brought along to increase the chances of friendship, and make my way down the hallway.\n This building is inhabited, but it\u2019s filthy. There are doors that are closed; other doors are open, with trash spilling out. I can smell peppers and rice cooking, overlaying the smells of mildew and dry rot. Somewhere in the building, there\u2019s a TV on. I know it\u2019s a TV just from the buoyant tone of the voices. TV Announcer Voice is one of those weird cultural constants.\n When I reach door 28, I knock on it. Twenty-eight was my favorite number when I was a kid. (It\u2019s a perfect number. That means that if you break it down into its factors, and add those numbers together, you get the number again. 1+ 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28. Andrew didn\u2019t much care about perfect numbers, but he listened to me talk about them.)\n He answers the door.\n I\u2019m not entirely sure what to expect, but I\u2019m surprised to see that he\u2019s shaved and clean, so \u201cunshaven\u201d was apparently what I was expecting. His hair is a lot grayer than in the pictures he had on his social media. \u201cCecily,\u201d he says, and his voice sounds exactly like I remember, which is also, in its own way, a surprise. \u201cCome in.\u201d He steps back from the door and I follow him into the apartment.\n There\u2019s a table, two rickety chairs, a large cask of water, a small gas burner. He puts water on to boil, and silently makes tea for both of us. I watch the leaves unfurl, not speaking.\n \u201cYou came all this way,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t offer you nicer surroundings.\u201d\n Unbidden, the image of the bed with the straps rises up in my mind and I bow my head over my tea and pretend to drink it. He watches me, and I look up in time to see his face shift. He thought I\u2019d come to help him. Or to warn him. Or just to see him. But he knows, now.\n \u201cHow soon are they coming?\u201d he asks.\n \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say.\n He looks up at the ceiling, blinks back tears.\n \u201cWhy not just kill me?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy betray me?\u201d\n \u201cI seriously considered that option,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I was going to have to pass through Chinese customs. Also, I\u2019m really not a violent person. Imagine me coming at you with a gun, even if I could get it through Chinese security. Or a knife.\u201d\n Tears spill down his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you throw a tray full of food into someone\u2019s face.\u201d\n He doesn\u2019t flinch away from my hand as I reach out, wipe his tears away with my thumb. \u201cYeah, and remember how ineffective that was? I got a trip to the principal\u2019s office out of it, that was it.\u201d I wipe his tears off on the side of my pants. \u201cWhy did you do it, Andrew?\u201d\n \u201cI told you years ago. I wanted to be strong.\u201d\n \u201cBut to sacrifice all those people. You didn\u2019t go seeking out the football players who were sexually harassing girls in the cafeteria line and assaulting boys in the locker room.\u201d\n \u201cNo. I looked for people who needed to be strong. I looked for the people I wanted to help.\u201d\n It\u2019s strange how easy it is to talk to him. Still. Here. My tea is growing cold on the table by my hand. \u201cWhy did you come here?\u201d\n \u201cI had to get out of the US before the bulletin went out. I speak Mandarin Chinese and around here, I thought maybe I could pass myself off as being from some other part of China. This region is where my grandfather came from, the one who immigrated to the US. It\u2019s quiet. I thought I could hide here, and maybe no one would come after me.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019d have followed you to the ends of the earth, Andrew.\u201d\n He hears a hint in my voice, even though I didn\u2019t mean to put one there.\n \u201cDo they want my formula?\u201d\n I don\u2019t answer, which is answer enough. He laughs. A little bitterly, a little triumphantly.\n \u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I have a bargaining chip after all.\u201d\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you assume that from the beginning?\u201d\n \u201cYou never know,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople have been known to waste what\u2019s right in front of them.\u201d\n It\u2019s true. They have.\n He picks up his tea, and his teacup slips out of his sweat-slicked, unsteady hand, crashing to the floor. He stares after it, at his hands, which are shaking. He touches his face, feeling the sweat on his cheeks, and he looks at me. I stand up, realizing that staying as long as I did may have been a mistake.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not coming,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one. Why\u2014what did you do to me\u2014what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n I step away, and he reaches out and grabs my wrists. I can feel his inhuman strength, and I wonder if I\u2019m about to find out just how wrong I was that he wouldn\u2019t turn it against me.\n \u201cThe FBI came first. They told me what you\u2019d done. The CIA came second. And they wanted me to make you an offer\u2014to tell you that if you gave me your formula to bring back to the US, and it was useful to them, you could come home. There\u2019d be no charges. They knew you were here, but they thought I\u2019d be able to approach you.\u201d\n \u201cBut instead,\u201d he says, \u201cYou decided to kill me.\u201d\n \u201cI demanded your notes. I said I needed whatever they had so that I could tell\u2014or at least guess\u2014before leaving China whether you were giving me fake information. They gave me what they had. I designed a bacterium that\u2019s harmless to most humans. Harmless, in fact, to any human who hasn\u2019t had the serum. It\u2019s fatal to you. It undoes, but only partially, what your serum did for you.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t need to kill you,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThey\u2019ll kill you.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them that your serum wasn\u2019t as good as you thought. That you died from its effects. Hopefully that\u2019ll discourage them from further research.\u201d\n \u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t? What if they just start with the notes I left behind? You don\u2019t think the US Military will kill thousands to get this serum?\u201d\n \u201cNo,\u201d I say, honestly. \u201cNot because they aren\u2019t evil. But because in the end, even the strongest, fastest, smartest human is still a human, and still the weakest link in the chain.\u201d\n Overcome with dizziness, Andrew lurches to the side, grabbing his table for support; he tries to lower himself back to his chair, but misses, and lands hard on the floor. His window to kill me has probably closed.\n He covers his face with his hands, and then says, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar. You\u2019re the worst liar I\u2019ve ever met. You barely fooled me for five minutes and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to fool the people who sent you.\u201d\n \u201cMaybe not,\u201d I say. \u201cBut if your serum dies with you, it\u2019ll still be worth it.\u201d\n He laughs, very faintly, and waves toward a corner. \u201cMy laptop,\u201d he says. \u201cPassword is your name.\u201d\n His clothes are soaked with his sweat, and now he\u2019s starting to cough, as his lungs fill with fluid released from their own cells. He gasps for air, like Tom did. Unlike Tom, his eyes are open. Open, and fixed on me. I watch as the whites of his eyes turn red, then black, as the blood vessels in them hemorrhage.\n One summer day when we were sixteen or seventeen, we went to a park and climbed up onto the roof of the picnic shelter and watched the sunset, and watched the sky grow dark, and then lay on the warm roof and looked up at the sky and watched for falling stars. It was the night of a meteor shower and my parents weren\u2019t willing to let me stay out all night to watch it at its height (which was supposed to be three to five AM) unless I wanted to do that from our backyard, but they were willing to let me stay out until midnight, so that\u2019s how late we stayed.\n \u201cAre you going to wish on the falling stars?\u201d he asked.\n \u201cThat seems silly,\u201d I said. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re not anything magical. They\u2019re caused by debris from a comet. They just look cool.\u201d\n \u201cYou\u2019re so scientific,\u201d he said, complaining a little. \u201cI bet you wished on shooting stars when you were little.\u201d\n \u201cYeah,\u201d I say.\n \u201cSo what did you wish for when you were little?\u201d he asked, when I didn\u2019t elaborate.\n \u201cI wished for a friend,\u201d I said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just falling stars, either. First star of the night, white horses, whatever. I always wished for a friend.\u201d\n The story I\u2019m going to tell is that he was dead when I arrived.\n Andrew\u2019s right that I\u2019m not a very accomplished liar. But this is a simple lie.\n They will definitely want his laptop. But he\u2019s given me the password\u2014and that means I can ensure that the data is unrecoverable, even if he didn\u2019t.\n I take gloves out of my pocket, pour out my tea, and return the cup to the cabinet, thinking about the step I\u2019m about to take. Laptops are often very personal. Mine has my work in progress, but it also has notes, journal entries, letters, musings, poetry.\n I would very much like to take the time to read all the things on Andrew\u2019s laptop that are not his research notes for the serum.\n But I\u2019ve already murdered my friend; if I don\u2019t destroy his notes, that will have been for nothing. So I wake the laptop, unlock it. I format the hard drive, then encrypt the formatted drive, making a fist and tapping the keyboard randomly to create a key for the encryption. Then I close the laptop and slip it into my bag to bring home, and sit down at the table, and wait for the rise and fall of Andrew\u2019s chest to stop.\n Naomi Kritzer has been writing science fiction and fantasy for over twenty years.

I attended the workshop back in 1998, and it was a watershed both in my artistic and commercial careers. The opportunity to talk with some of the people who were basically where I\u2019d been fifteen years before was cool and weird and a little dizzying.\n We were at the bar even though I don\u2019t drink, and a few of them asked me if I had any advice about how to approach the workshop. I rattled some things off the top of my head. Most were of the very mundane, very basic sort. Don\u2019t be afraid to try new things. Don\u2019t assume that your career is going to take off immediately after the workshop. Genre fiction is a small industry; try not to sleep with anyone you wouldn\u2019t want to hang out with at a convention in twenty years. The usual. But I\u2019ve been thinking about it more since, and there was, I think, one genuinely useful thing I said that night. I hope it didn\u2019t get lost amid the clutter.\n I have never been invited to teach at any of the big workshops, and it\u2019s perfectly possible I never will be. It\u2019s a prestigious position, a position of real trust, and requires skills well beyond being able to put together a good sentence, a good story, or even a useful critique. But I fantasize for a living, and sometimes I fantasize about what I would say to those imaginary students. That\u2019s pretty much the same as imagining what I would say to myself, if I could reach that earlier version of me.\n I imagine it\u2019s the Sunday night before the first week. That the students are all there, just meeting each other in person for the first time, taking stock of each other, getting ready for a six-week bootcamp. It\u2019s a class, and like all classes, people have roles they\u2019re comfortable with\u2014teacher\u2019s pet, class clown, bad kid in the back row\u2014all complicated by having the fragile narcissism that comes with doing something with no objective standard of success. I remember that night from the last time I was there, and apart from shifting valence, my daydream\u2019s pretty much the same.\n I imagine having everyone sit down at a single, long table. I stand at the head, of course, because I\u2019m the teacher and all fantasies of teaching are power fantasies. I smile, and I look at each of them, make eye contact, get their attention, and I say:\n \u201cAll right. Before we start, take a minute. Look around. Look at all the other faces in this room. This is your team. You should write that down, because it\u2019s probably the smartest thing I\u2019m going to say in the whole time I\u2019m here, and you\u2019re going to forget it.\n \u201cIt\u2019s not that your dumb or that you\u2019re not paying attention. It\u2019s just that we all forget sometimes. Someone says something that sits wrong about something we did, and we start thinking they\u2019re our enemy. Or someone does something really freaking great and we get jealous and start thinking of them as the one we should try to beat. We want to be the star of the class, and we look at everyone and start seeing them as competition. No one here is your competition. This is your team. These are the people who are going to push you to be better, and who you\u2019re going to push. These are the people you\u2019re going to be talking with when you have the conversations that help you define your ambitions. These are the people you\u2019re going to know when you break in, and when you\u2019re on top, and when your career tanks and you have to reinvent yourself.\n \u201cThe truth of the matter is that nothing you do at a workshop like this matters. Workshops aren\u2019t about making great stories, they\u2019re about making great writers. If you turn out a perfect polished work here and sell it the minute it comes off the printer, that\u2019ll be cool, but it won\u2019t matter. If you can do that three times a year for the next decade, you\u2019ll have a small but respectable career. If you don\u2019t, you can always be the one who people say Oh yeah, you remember X? She had that one really good story. What ever happened to her?\n \u201cYou\u2019re going to spend your time here, and it\u2019s going to kick your ass. You\u2019ll get better, you\u2019ll burn out for a while. You\u2019ll get out, and you\u2019ll start doing the work that matters, and you\u2019re going to forget. You\u2019re going to tell yourselves stories about how there are only so many slots in the magazines, so many book contracts, so many slots on the Hugo short list. Hell, only so many Hugo Awards or Nebulas or whatever floats your boat. And you\u2019ll start thinking that you\u2019re in competition. You aren\u2019t. These people aren\u2019t your competition, and they never will be. Not in any way that matters.\n \u201cBetween 1965 and 2007, Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune sold about 12 million copies\u2014more than any other science fiction book\u2014and that was across 14 languages and I don\u2019t know how many countries. There are 300 million people in the United States alone. Right now, with A Dance With Dragons glued to the top of the bestseller\u2019s list for months and the HBO program getting awards and accolades and spoofs on Saturday Night Live, I still meet people on a regular basis who don\u2019t know who George RR Martin is. None of us\u2014even the best\u2014come close to saturating the market. Commercially, our competition isn\u2019t each other, it\u2019s Netflix and beer. Artistically, it\u2019s always and only ourselves.\n \u201cPaula Vogel is a playwright and teacher. She said circles rise together. Look around the table. This is your circle, or at least the start of it. If we do this right, these are the people who are going to rise along with you. This is spring training, and this is your team, and what we do here is prepare for the real work, which is what we do out there, together, once this is over. Everyone cool with that? All right, then. Let\u2019s get to work.\u201d\n And then I congratulate myself about how wise I am and how everyone who hears me will be ennobled and enlightened and generally speaking have a better time of it. It\u2019s a daydream. If it doesn\u2019t gratify the ego, what\u2019s the point, right?\n But what I\u2019m coming to realize is that circle isn\u2019t something that stops. I\u2019ve had a writing career long enough that I\u2019ve accrued a few petty enmities. I\u2019ve had fellow writers who have said deeply cruel things about me, and I\u2019m sure there are some about whom I have been less that charitable. I\u2019ve been up for a few awards, and I\u2019ve hoped defeat for my fellow short-listers, and they have sometimes spoken ill of me.\n But I have also, at one time and another, through accident or intention or some combination of the two, forged friendships with people who I admire, who have helped me\u2014commercially and artistically\u2014and who I hope I\u2019ve been able to lift up too, if only a little bit.\n I want to say that my generation of writers is a team too, that we\u2019re all part of a great big circle that can inspire and encourage and push and challenge itself to new and glorious heights, but the fact is we\u2019re humans. We\u2019re a small industry, but we can\u2019t all fit around a table. We\u2019re fractious and mean and often very impressed with ourselves for exactly the reasons we should be a little embarrassed. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unlike the rest of the world that way, at least.\n I do believe that the opportunity is there, though. Even if it\u2019s only in making a small circle, or keeping it for a short time, there is a virtue in finding and maintaining a team. A circle. The rest of the Paula Vogel quote goes like this: Find the people you want to work with, and work with them. It\u2019s something I forget, especially in the apparent isolation of writing, but it\u2019s the advice I would have given myself fifteen years ago. And I\u2019d still be wise to take it now.\n And that\u2019s not just writing. That\u2019s the world.\n Daniel Abraham is a writer of genre fiction with a dozen books in print and over thirty published short stories.

Wise", "categories": null, "tags": null, "id": 0, "license": null, "comments": null, "source-hostname": "Clarkesworld Magazine", "text": "4070 words, short story\nThe Children of Main Street\nThe first thing the children of the colony learned after the ship landed was how to change genders.\nThey\u2019d been born in the long dark between the stars; not one had ever set foot on Earth, on good, solid ground. They\u2019d never known a fixed sky, just the star-shot dark tumbling past the ship\u2019s portholes as they hurtled towards a new world.\nThey\u2019d grown like weeds in the cracks of the ship, playing quiet games. Laughing and running were forbidden, making them always too loud, and too much in the way.\nWhen the ship finally touched down, when the doors hissed open, they ran. They ran under an alien sky, under twin moons, and breathed the dome-filtered air while their parents hid behind walls and fretted about creating Earth-like homes. A new world turned under their feet, and though they didn\u2019t understand with their conscious minds, the children sensed in their bones that things were different here. The old rules did not apply. So they changed.\nThe colony doctors ran tests. They drew blood, hooked the children up to electrodes, and flashed them with x-rays\u2014all to no avail. As a last resort, the grown-ups broke down and finally asked the children. The children simply looked at each other and smiled, some with secrets tucked in their cheeks, but most with pity in their eyes.\nFor better or for worse, the adults realized, this was the way of the world now\u2014twin moons, an oddly colored sun, life under a giant dome, and children who flickered and changed as quick as passing storms. Some days the cul-de-sac at the end of Main Street would be filled with nothing but little boys, some nothing but little girls, and others the genders would be split evenly with no rhyme or reason.\nTiffany Webster stood in the kitchen doorway, gathering her nerve. Her son . . . no, her daughter now, sat at the kitchen table wearing a pink dress, head bent and face hidden by a curtain of silky brown hair. Pink shoes that matched the pink dress swung under the table, the little girl\u2019s heels thumping the chair railing in an irregular rhythm.\nThe dress and shoes had been a present from Tiffany\u2019s husband George, no doubt. George had had a much easier time adjusting. Despite the fact he\u2019d always wanted a son, he seemed delighted to occasionally have a daughter now, too. He called it the best of both worlds.\nTiffany edged closer, peering over her daughter\u2019s shoulder. Dust-laden sunlight, just a shade different from the sun back home, slanted through the window and illuminated the scatter of construction paper, crayons, glitter and glue spread across the table. Michael . . . Michaela . . . was making a Mother\u2019s Day card. A sob lodged in Tiffany\u2019s throat.\nI\u2019m a horrible mother.\nThe thought was stark, cutting-sharp, but true. She\u2019d been avoiding her son, now her daughter, for weeks. She couldn\u2019t stand the sight of the quick-silver changeling who\u2019d taken the place of her precious, little boy. She couldn\u2019t be around her.\nTiffany didn\u2019t trust herself not to grab the little girl by the shoulders, shake her until her head snapped back and forth on her slender neck, and demand to know where Michael had gone. The violence of the thought shocked her, it made her hands shake, but it wouldn\u2019t go away.\nEver since Tiffany could remember, she\u2019d wanted a child. She and George had talked about it on their honeymoon; he\u2019d wanted it as much as she had. They\u2019d spent nights lying in bed together, his stomach fitted against the curve of her spine, coming up with baby names.\nIt had been so hard, waiting as they went through the colony application program. They wanted that, too\u2014a fresh new world, a place of their own. They\u2019d been patient. Then, almost the moment they\u2019d woken from cryo-sleep, ten years from planet-fall, they\u2019d started trying for a baby.\nTiffany had gotten pregnant almost right away. When Michael was born, she\u2019d been so happy. She\u2019d been so proud, watching her son grow. Then she ship landed, and everything changed. A stranger\u2014a girl with long, brown hair looked at her with Michael\u2019s bright blue eyes and called her mommy.\nTiffany plastered a smile across her face, cheeks pulling so tight they hurt, and crossed the room. She touched her daughter\u2019s silky hair, proud she could do so without flinching.\n\u201cMichaela, honey, what do you want for breakfast?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m Michael today, Mommy.\u201d The little boy in pink turned, crayon poised mid-scribble. He had Michael\u2019s face, Michael\u2019s blue eyes and rounded cheeks, but he had Michaela\u2019s long hair and wore Michaela\u2019s clothes.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Tiffany\u2019s hand flew to her mouth, covering an absence of words. Her eyes ached, hot, stinging, and dry.\nTiffany stepped back, and continued backing away, shaking her head. She\u2019d tried, she really had, but she couldn\u2019t handle this stranger with her son\u2019s eyes, her son\u2019s face.\nMichael continued to watch her. Tiffany couldn\u2019t tear her gaze away from her son, from the crayon in his hand, and the litter of paper hearts around him. Instead of hurt and confusion, Tiffany saw calm acceptance, an alien stillness she couldn\u2019t fathom. It was as though he\u2019d known this moment would come.\nTiffany bumped into the door, fumbling for the knob without turning around. The motion jarred loose tears, blurring Michael and Michaela into one. She slammed the door, and put both hands over her mouth again.\nStanding on the porch, Tiffany listened for footsteps. She imagined Michael\u2019s chubby hand pressed against the other side of the door, still smelling of wax from gripping the crayon, fragments of color caught under his nails. She jerked away, took a deep breath, and turned around. Squaring her shoulders, Tiffany walked down Main Street.\nChildren ran shrieking around the cul-de-sac, laughing. Little Bobby Mercer had blonde braids, and little Becky Simmons had torn jeans and a bloody nose from a fight with another boy. Tiffany had known these children since they\u2019d been born, and now they were strangers to her, all of them.\nTiffany left the cul-de-sac behind. Perfect houses lined the street, set on neat squares of lawn, planted with flowers and trees. It looked like home, but it was a lie. The dome arched between her and the sky, curving around their settlement like a parent\u2019s protective arms. Beyond the dome lay gray dust; beyond the thin veil of sunlight lay darkness and cold stars.\nShe knew the same vastness, the same vacuum, surrounded earth, but she could feel it here. She was a long way from home, crushingly small, terrifyingly alone. It hurt. The distance wound out from her heart, a thread of physical pain, but she couldn\u2019t follow it back home, not ever again.\nThey\u2019d left earth during Kennedy\u2019s second term, under the threatening shadow of war, but that was a lifetime ago\u2014several lifetimes. Every one she knew back home was long dead. Her sister\u2019s children, maybe even their children\u2019s children, were bones and dust. For all she knew, there was no earth anymore. The sun might be an ember by now, its light winked out of the sky, taking the blue-bright ball of the earth with it. She and the other colonists might be the last humans in existence. And even they were barely human anymore.\nPressure built, pushing against her temples, filling the space around her lungs. Tiffany\u2019s pulse kept time with her steps, which carried her to one of the gates where the four-wheel exploration vehicles, encased in protective plastic bubbles, passed through the dome and out onto the alien terrain.\nTiffany hid, watching the guards check each vehicle through. Her pulse slowed; the pressure eased. She memorized the timing, the way the inner gate locked, unable to open until the outer door completed its cycle. When the guard waved the next car through, Tiffany darted in behind it.\nThe gate hissed shut, muffling the guards\u2019 shouts, dampening the sound of fists pounding on the door. The opposite end of the gateway opened onto the killing cold and the poison air. The four-wheeler drove out onto the alien terrain, and Tiffany Webster followed calmly behind it.\nSarah Beth Dolan stood at the sink, staring through the window at her son Timmy\u2014who was sometimes her daughter Tamara\u2014playing in the yard. Bubbles melted, the breakfast dishes forgotten under them, while the water cooled. Sarah Beth held a dripping plate in one hand, a dishtowel limp in the other.\nTimmy kicked a soccer ball against the fence, diving to save against an imagined goal as the ball bounced back. Grass stains smudged his bare knees. His hair, a brown mop, hid his eyes. Sarah Beth couldn\u2019t remember what color those eyes were.\nShe remembered the doctor placing a squalling baby in her arms. Its face had been red and mashed, wisps of dark hair plastered against its still-soft skull. Its eyes were screwed up tight against the ship\u2019s lights, its fists clenched, flailing at the unfairness of being born. It screamed.\nSarah Beth remembered thinking the baby didn\u2019t look like her or her husband Mark; it didn\u2019t really look like anything at all. She couldn\u2019t even tell if it was a boy or a girl, not until the doctor told her. Now, she couldn\u2019t remember what the doctor had said.\nShe knew the gap in her memory should frighten her, but Sarah Beth felt strangely calm. A sense of peace wrapped her like a warm blanket on a cold day. Maybe it was something in the light, or something in the air, slipping in despite the dome. Sarah Beth couldn\u2019t give it a name, but things were different here.\nAll her life, she\u2019d dreamed of going up among the stars. She\u2019d followed the saga of the first colonists, the ones who\u2019d built this place, and longed to be one of them. She\u2019d watched, rapt, full of terror and awe as reports of the colonists\u2019 disappearance began to filter in. But even that gave her hope. There were those who believed that the colonists hadn\u2019t disappeared, they\u2019d simply changed.\nWhen she\u2019d been accepted into the colony program, Sarah Beth had been ecstatic. Deep down, she\u2019d wanted to do more than see alien places; she\u2019d wanted to be alien.\nShe\u2019d never told anyone, not even Mark. But ever since she was little, Sarah Beth had known there was a seed buried deep in her chest, waiting to bloom. It filled her with a wanting she couldn\u2019t name, a restlessness that manifested as a feeling of drowning on dry land. There had to be something more.\nShe wanted to be like the superheroes in comic books\u2014the books her father had always said weren\u2019t for girls; books she\u2019d had to sneak into her brother\u2019s room to read when her parents weren\u2019t looking. An alien with a destiny, who didn\u2019t belong on earth, but who was special somehow\u2014Sarah Beth wanted to be more than just flesh and blood and bone.\nSarah Beth set the dripping plate on the counter and walked outside. She stood on the deck, and touched her cheeks; they felt hot and flushed against her palm. She took a deep breath, in and out.\nThey\u2019d come so far across the stars, to a brand new land full of promise . . . and they\u2019d tried to replicate the world they\u2019d left behind. The perfect houses and gardens replicating Earth-life cloyed; they were ghastly. Looking at them day in and day out broke Sarah Beth\u2019s heart. This wasn\u2019t the life she\u2019d dreamed. She couldn\u2019t go on like her husband, pretending to care about the things that had been important back home. Accounting, tax laws, chat around the water cooler\u2014those things meant nothing here.\n\u201cTimmy?\u201d\nThe boy looked up. He stopped the soccer ball expertly with one foot. Sarah Beth crouched, touching Timmy\u2019s arm to assure herself of his solidity, as if he might shift before her eyes. With her other hand, she brushed the mop of hair from his eyes. They were blue-gray.\n\u201cCan you teach me to how to change?\u201d\nMark Dolan came home to find a strange man sitting on his couch. The man jumped up as Mark entered, released like a coiled spring.\n\u201cWho . . . ?\u201d Mark faltered.\nThe ship that carried them across the stars left no room for strangers. Mark knew every person under the dome, but this man, he\u2019d never seen before.\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Sarah?\u201d\n\u201cMark, it\u2019s me.\u201d Sarah stepped forward.\nMark stared. The man\u2019s cheeks appeared fresh-shaved, but a hint of stubble, like a shadow underneath the skin, persisted. He wore one of Mark\u2019s suits, the gray jacket too large on his short, compact frame\u2014the sleeves hanging past his wrists, the pant cuffs pooling over the polished wingtip shoes Mark wore to meetings.\n\u201cMark?\u201d The man who claimed to be Sarah moved closer, nervously clasping his hands in front of him. Mark watched the man\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple bob.\n\u201cMark, it\u2019s me.\u201d The man touched Mark\u2019s chest, thick, square fingers resting against Mark\u2019s lapel. The stranger\u2019s eyes begged for understanding; they were Sarah Beth\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mark.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re my wife!\u201d Mark stepped out from under the man\u2019s touch, staring. His left arm tingled.\n\u201cI\u2019m still your wife.\u201d The stranger\u2019s voice was deep and quiet.\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t . . . \u201d Mark\u2019s ears rang; his mind reeled. The words came all at once. \u201cHow could you do this? How did you do this? With the children it was bad enough, but . . . my God! Didn\u2019t you hear about Tiffany Webster? What were you thinking? We\u2019ve been married for sixteen years!\u201d\nSixteen years. The words lodged in Mark\u2019s chest. It would be more if he counted the years they\u2019d been asleep, side by side in their cryogenic pods.\nHe remembered waking up with Sarah Beth beside him. They\u2019d been so shy; it was almost the way it had been when they were first dating, even though they\u2019d been married for six years. They\u2019d spent weeks getting to know each other again, talking about the strange dreams they\u2019d had as they tumbled through the stars.\nThey\u2019d walked the ship\u2019s corridors holding hands, the way they\u2019d held hands as high school sweethearts. In those weeks, she\u2019d been a stranger to him, but she\u2019d still been Sarah Beth, his wife, the woman he loved. And now . . .\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mark.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes held genuine regret. \u201cI still love you. I understand if you can\u2019t love me, and . . . and I think that\u2019s okay.\u201d The man bit his lip.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d\nThe man touched the back of the couch, fingers flexing against the fabric, a nervous gesture that reminded Mark so much of Sarah Beth that he wanted to scream. He needed his wife back. He needed her arms around him, her voice telling him everything would be okay.\n\u201cHow can I explain? Things are just . . . different here.\u201d The man met Mark\u2019s eyes, pleading once more for understanding. He looked torn, but Mark could read his expression, all too familiar, and knew which way the man who claimed to be his wife was leaning.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Mark heard the word, knew he spoke it, but it meant nothing.\nThe totality of the situation crashed down on him. Nothing had meaning anymore. The house squeezed claustrophobically tight around him. His chest echoed the house, crushing his heart and lungs. The very worst part was, deep down he knew the man . . . he knew Sarah . . . was right.\nEverything was different here\u2014the patterns of stars, the twin moons, the strange-colored sun. The rules had changed. He never should have come. They never should have come\u2014not just their family, but people, human beings.\nTheir neighbor Tiffany had walked right out of the dome and died in the cold dark under the alien stars. That was what awaited them out here; that was the choice\u2014death or a world gone mad.\nMark opened his mouth. The back door flew open, interrupting him, and Timmy came thundering into the room.\n\u201cHey, Mom, hey, Dad.\u201d Timmy addressed his parents in turn. \u201cCan I go to Becky-Brad\u2019s house tonight? There\u2019s going to be a sleepover.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sarah Beth answered at the same time as Mark said, \u201cNo.\u201d\nMark put his hand to his head. The room spun.\n\u201cDad?\u201d\nMark lowered his hand. His son looked at him, puzzled. Mark looked back and forth between the strange man and the strange child.\nHe pinched the bridge of his nose. He felt as though he hadn\u2019t slept in years. He sighed. \u201cYes, of course, you can go.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Dad!\u201d Timmy darted in, kissed his father on the cheek, kissed his mother, and ran up the stairs. Mark watched his son, bewildered.\nIn the space between breakfast and now, Mark had somehow lost both his wife and his son. They were running ahead, towards an unknown future, going somewhere he wasn\u2019t even sure he wanted to follow.\nThree weeks later Mark said, \u201cI\u2019m sleeping with Anna Mancuso.\u201d\nHe was amazed at the steadiness of his voice. Sarah Beth turned from the stove.\nHis wife looked like her old self again. Her changes were as liquid-smooth and quick as their son\u2019s now, but Mark could barely look at her. Regardless of her appearance, she was a stranger. He\u2019d tried to touch her, once, but the brief attempt left him physically sick. He\u2019d come back into the bedroom long enough to gather a pillow and an extra blanket before retreating to the couch. They\u2019d slept on separate floors of the house ever since.\n\u201cHer husband ran off with another woman, though he\u2019s calling himself Charlene now. They\u2019re living together like . . . \u201d Mark trailed off, shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\nSarah Beth, who sometimes called herself John now, remained expressionless. Her eyes, which had been the only constant through her changes, had turned strange\u2014a blue-grey reflecting the alien sky arched above the dome. For the sheer contrast, they made Mark think of the aching blue summer days he\u2019d experienced in Iowa as a young boy.\nBack then they\u2019d lived in a big, rambling farmhouse at the end of a road bordered by fields of wheat. Though the floorboards sagged, and the roof leaked during heavy rains, it felt like home. They\u2019d moved so often during his childhood. Each time hurt, but somehow leaving the farmhouse felt like having his roots ripped out of the soil. He wanted something solid, some place to call home, and he\u2019d followed Sarah Beth to the stars, thinking she was his home. She was supposed to be the one constant that would never change, but now . . .\nSarah Beth set the wooden spoon back into the pot of sauce, and lowered the burner. Mark had expected hysterics; he\u2019d expected her to cry, or even hit him. Would she react like a man, or a woman? Would she try to solve their differences with words, or a knock-down, drag-out fight? He didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know anything about Sarah Beth anymore.\nBut she did nothing. Her perfect calm was unsettling; it dropped his heart into his gut. Sarah Beth wiped her hands on a dishtowel and stood behind one of the kitchen chairs, bracing her hands its back. She regarded him steadily.\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\nWhat? What do you understand? Mark wanted to scream, but his tongue froze. How could she be so calm? She\u2019d told him on the day she changed that she still loved him. She\u2019d told him again\u2014at least half a dozen times since \u2014 but the words meant nothing. They were like the word wife, like marriage, like boy and girl. Everything on this damned planet was different; nothing made sense anymore.\n\u201cI should go.\u201d Mark turned. Sarah Beth, who was sometimes John, watched him. Her alien eyes exerted physical pressure on the tension strung between his shoulder blades. At any moment, he would snap.\n\u201cCall me,\u201d Sarah Beth said. \u201cIf you ever want to come home, I mean. Tamara will miss you, but I know she\u2019ll understand.\u201d\nMark didn\u2019t answer. He walked out the door and down the street to Anna Mancuso\u2019s house. His hand shook as he rang her bell.\nAnna opened the door, her eyes red as though she\u2019d been crying. Coats hung neatly from a row of hooks beside the door, shoes lined up beneath them. Mark noticed that Anna\u2019s husband had left his shoes beside Anna\u2019s, as though he might come back at any moment, or as though items that mundane simply didn\u2019t matter anymore.\nLooking at Anna, Mark knew without a doubt that he didn\u2019t love her. She was steady, she didn\u2019t change; she was something to hold onto. He thought about Sarah Beth, about the way she\u2019d been when they\u2019d boarded the ship together. He kept the image in his mind as he took Anna\u2019s face between his hands and kissed her\u2014long and deep and searching.\nAnna kissed him back, clinging as though Mark was the last thing keeping her from drowning. He wondered if she had any illusions about love, or whether she understood what they had as well as he did. He realized he didn\u2019t care. He backed her towards the kitchen, towards the table, which still smelled of furniture wax. The whole kitchen smelled clean, as though Anna had spent hours scrubbing.\nMark shoved one of the chairs out of the way with his foot, bending Anna back over the table. He fumbled with his belt, getting his pants down around his ankles and leaving them there. Anna responded, as though by rote, going through the motions of desire. Her gaze fixed on some point beyond his left shoulder as she unbuttoned her blouse.\nBy the time they were done, twin moons shone soft light through the kitchen window. They lit Anna as she turned her face away, showing the threads of gray just starting to lighten her hair. Given enough time, everything changed.\nMark gathered his pants, belting them perfunctorily. He didn\u2019t look at Anna. He looked at the strange sky, wondering if he\u2019d ever be happy again.\nIt wasn\u2019t fair, the one who had been Sarah Beth-John considered as s/he looked down the hill at the human settlement below. The dome gleamed with reflected starlight, a soap bubble, thin and frail, struggling to hold back the night. S/he hadn\u2019t meant to hurt anyone. Why did change have to be this way? Why did the most important things in the universe have to be full of pain? Why did the new have to rip the old apart before taking its place?\nS/he sighed. The child who had been Willy-Jane slipped long, thin fingers into Sarah Beth-John\u2019s hand, and s/he offered it a smile. Timmy-Tamara took hir other hand. Its blue-gray eyes caught starlight; they seemed wide enough to hold the entire sky. The faint ache in hir heart faded as Sarah Beth-John turned and guided the children away from the view of the settlement below.\nS/he and the others\u2014the ones who had been Catherine-Steve, Laura-Matt, Karen-Dave, Charlene-Charles\u2014they\u2019d tell the children stories of Earth-that-was with fondness in the years to come. Even if the humans didn\u2019t believe it, even if they thought their former friends, lovers, and children mad, those that had changed still honored their past. It was a part of them, but it was a fragment of a larger whole. The universe was so much larger out here.\nMaybe someday the humans would understand. Maybe they\u2019d come up into the hills, following in the footsteps of those who had come before them. Maybe they\u2019d wake up one morning, and they wouldn\u2019t be afraid anymore.\nTheir lungs would be new, their limbs long, their eyes blue-gray and wide enough to hold the stars. They\u2019d walk out of the dome, and breathe the alien air; they\u2019d step barefoot over the soft sands and croon-sing to their brother-sisters, asking to come home. They would be welcomed, as Sarah Beth-John and the others had been by those who had gone before them.\nOn that day, Sarah Beth-John would rejoice. Until then, she\u2019d hold them in hir heart. S/he\u2019d love them, just as s/he loved hir brother-sisters here above the human\u2019s dome. It didn\u2019t matter if it took forever, or if the change never happened. S/he could be patient. S/he could wait until the end of the world.\nA.C. Wise's fiction has appeared in publications such as Uncanny, Clarkesworld, Tor.com, and several Year's Best anthologies.

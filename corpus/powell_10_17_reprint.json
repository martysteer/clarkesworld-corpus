Paige stands in the oak-paneled front bar of a small corner pub. She has wet hair because she walked here from her hotel. Now she\u2019s standing by the open door, holding half a liter of Amstel, watching the rain stipple the surface of the canal across the street. For the fourth time in five minutes, she takes out her mobile and checks the screen for messages. From across the room, the barman looks at her. He has dark skin and gold dreads. Seeing the phone in her hand again, he smiles, obviously convinced she\u2019s waiting for a date.\n Outside, damp tourists pass in the rain, looking for the Anne Frank house; open-topped pleasure boats seek shelter beneath humped-back bridges; and bare-headed boys cut past on scooters, cigarettes flaring, girlfriends clinging side-saddle to the parcel shelves, tires going bop-bop-bop on the wet cobblestones. Paige sucks the froth from her beer. On the other side of the canal, a church bell clangs nine o\u2019clock. As it happens, she is waiting for a man, but this won\u2019t be any sort of date, and she\u2019ll be lucky if she survives to see the sun come up tomorrow morning. She pockets the mobile, changes the beer glass from one hand to the other, and slips her fingers into the pocket of her coat, allowing them to brush the cold metal butt of the pistol she\u2019s carrying. It\u2019s a lightweight coil gun: a magnetic projectile accelerator, fifty years more advanced than anything else in this time zone, and capable of punching a titanium slug through a concrete wall. With luck, it will be enough.\n She watches the barman lay out new beer mats on the zinc counter. He\u2019s just a boy, really. She should probably warn him to leave, but she doesn\u2019t want to attract too much attention, not just yet. She doesn\u2019t want the police to blunder in and complicate matters.\n For a moment, her eyes are off the door, and that\u2019s when Josef arrives. She hears the swish of his coat, the clack of his boots as they hit the step. She sees the barman\u2019s gaze flick past her shoulder, and his eyes widen, and she turns to find Josef standing on the threshold, close enough to kiss.\n \u201cHello, Paige.\u201d He\u2019s at least five inches taller than she is; rake thin with pale lips and rain-slicked hair.\n \u201cJosef.\u201d She slides her right hand into her coat, sees him notice the movement.\n \u201cAre you here to kill me, Paige?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\n \u201cI know.\u201d\n He flicks his eyes in the direction of the bar, licks his bottom lip. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d\n Paige takes a step back, placing herself between the \u201cvampire\u201d and the boy with the golden dreadlocks. With her hand still in her pocket, she curls her index finger around the trigger of the coil gun.\n \u201cNot tonight, Josef.\u201d\n Josef shrugs and folds his arms, shifts his weight petulantly from one foot to the other.\n \u201cSo, what?\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to go at it right now, in here?\u201d\n Paige shakes her head. She\u2019s trying not to show emotion, but her heart\u2019s hammering and she\u2019s sure he can hear it.\n \u201cOutside,\u201d she says. Josef narrows his eyes. He looks her up and down, assessing her as an opponent. Despite his attenuated frame, she knows he can strike like a whip when he wants to. She tenses, ready for his attack and, for a moment, they\u2019re frozen like that: eyes locked, waiting for the other to make the first move. Then Josef laughs. He turns on his heel, flicks up the collar of his coat, and steps out into the rain.\n Paige lets out a long breath. Her stomach\u2019s churning. She pulls the coil gun from her pocket and looks over at the barman.\n \u201cStay here,\u201d she says.\n She follows Josef into a small concrete yard at the rear of the pub, surrounded by walls on all sides, and lit from above by the orange reflection of city lights on low cloud. Rusty dumpsters stand against one wall; a fire escape ladder hangs from the back of the pub; and metal trapdoors cover the cellar. Two stories above, the gutters leak, spattering the concrete.\n Josef says, \u201cSo, how do you want to do this?\u201d\n Paige lets the peeling wooden door to the street bang shut behind her, hiding them from passers-by. The coil gun feels heavy in her hand.\n \u201cGet over by the wall,\u201d she says.\n Josef shakes his head.\n She opens her mouth to insist but, before she can speak or raise the gun, he\u2019s closed the distance between them, his weight slamming her back against the wooden door. She feels his breath on her cheek, his hand clasping her throat. She tries to bring the gun to bear but he chops it away, sending it clattering across the wet floor.\n \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic,\u201d he growls, and lifts her by the throat. Her feet paw at empty air. She tries to prize his hand loose, but his fingers are like talons, and she can\u2019t breathe; she\u2019s choking. In desperation, she kicks his kneecap, making him stagger. With a snarl, he tosses her against one of the large wheeled dumpsters. She hits it with an echoing crash, and ends up on her hands and knees, coughing, struggling for air. Josef\u2019s boot catches her in the ribs, and rolls her onto her side. He stamps down once, twice, and something snaps in her left forearm. The pain fills her. She yelps, and curls herself around it. The coil gun rests on the concrete three or four meters away on the other side of the yard, and there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll let her reach it. He kicks her twice more, then leans down with his mouth open, letting her see his glistening ceramic incisors. They\u2019re fully extended now, locked in attack position, and ready to tear out her windpipe.\n \u201cHa\u2019 enough?\u201d he says, the fangs distorting his speech.\n Paige coughs again. She\u2019s cradling her broken arm, and she still can\u2019t breathe properly. She\u2019s about to tell him to go to hell, when the back door of the pub swings open, and out steps the boy with the golden dreads, a sawn-off antique shotgun held at his hip.\n \u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d he says. His eyes are wide and scared.\n Josef looks up with a hiss, teeth bared. Startled, the barman pulls the trigger. The flash and bang fill the yard. Josef takes both barrels in the chest. It snatches him away like laundry in the wind, and he lands by the door to the street, flapping and yelling, drumming his boot heels on the concrete.\n \u201cShoot him again,\u201d Paige gasps, but the young man stands frozen in place, transfixed by the thrashing vampire. He hasn\u2019t even reloaded. Paige uses her good arm to claw her way into a sitting position. The rain\u2019s soaked through her clothes.\n \u201cShoot him!\u201d\n But it\u2019s too late. Still hollering, Josef claws his way through the wooden door, out onto the street. Paige pulls herself up and makes it to the pavement just in time to see him slip over the edge of the bank, into the canal, dropping noiselessly into the water between two tethered barges. She turns back to find the boy with the shotgun looking at her.\n \u201cIs he dead?\u201d\n She shakes her head. The air\u2019s tangy with gun smoke. \u201cNo, he\u2019ll be back.\u201d She scoops up her fallen coil gun and slides it back into her coat pocket. Her left arm\u2019s clutched against her chest. Every time she moves, she has to bite her lip against the pain.\n The boy takes her by the shoulder, and she can feel his hands shake as he guides her into the pub kitchen, where she leans against the wall as he locks and bolts the back door.\n When she asks, the boy tells her his name is Federico. He settles her on a barstool, plonks a shot glass and a half-empty bottle of cognac on the counter, then goes to close the front door.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to call the police,\u201d he says.\n As he brushes past her, Paige catches his arm. \u201cThere\u2019s no time, we have to leave.\u201d\n He looks down at her hand.\n \u201cI don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d he says. \u201cNot until you explain what the hell just happened.\u201d\n She releases him. He\u2019s frightened, but the fear\u2019s manifesting as anger, and she\u2019s going to have to do something drastic to convince him.\n \u201cOkay,\u201d she says. She puts her left arm on the bar and rolls up the sleeve, letting him see the bloody contusions from Josef\u2019s boot, and the splinter of bone, like a shard of broken china, sticking up through the skin.\n \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n \u201cShush.\u201d She takes hold of her wrist, forces the arm flat against the zinc counter, and twists. There\u2019s an audible click, and the two halves of broken bone snap back into place. When her eyes have stopped watering, she plucks out the loose shard and drops it with a clink into the ashtray. With it out of the way, the skin around the tear starts to heal. In less than a minute, only a red mark remains.\n Frederico takes a step back, eyes wide, hand pointing.\n \u201cThat\u2019s not natural.\u201d\n Paige lifts the half-empty bottle of cognac with her right hand, pulls the plastic-coated cork with her teeth, and spits it across the bar.\n \u201cJosef heals even faster than I do,\u201d she says. \u201cYou blew a hole in his chest, but he\u2019ll be as good as new in an hour, maybe less.\u201d\n \u201cW-what are you?\u201d\n Paige takes a solid nip of the brandy.\n \u201cI\u2019m as human as you are,\u201d she says, and gets to her feet. She can feel the stiffness fading from her limbs, the hurt evaporating from her ribs and arm. \u201cBut Josef\u2019s something quite different. And trust me, you really don\u2019t want to be here when he comes back.\u201d\n \u201cBut the police\u2014\u201d\n \u201cForget the police. You shot him, that makes it personal.\u201d\n Federico puts his fists on his hips.\n \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n Paige jerks a thumb at the back door. \u201cThen believe what you saw out there.\u201d She stands and pats down her coat, making sure she still has everything she needs. Federico looks from her to the door, and then back again.\n \u201cIs he really that dangerous?\u201d\n \u201cOh yes.\u201d\n \u201cThen, what do you suggest?\u201d\n Paige rubs her face. She doesn\u2019t want to be saddled with a civilian, doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for anybody else\u2019s well-being; but this young man saved her life, and she knows she owes him for that.\n She sighs.\n \u201cYour best bet\u2019s to come with me, right now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the only one who knows what we\u2019re up against, the only one with even half a chance of being able to protect you.\u201d\n \u201cHow do I know I can trust you?\u201d\n She looks him square in the eye.\n \u201cBecause I\u2019m not the one who\u2019s going to come back here and rip your throat out.\u201d\n She lets Federico pull on a battered leather biker jacket two sizes too large, and they leave the pub and splash their way down the cobbled streets in the direction of the Red Light District, and Paige\u2019s hotel. As they walk, she keeps her eye on the canal.\n Federico says, \u201cIs he really a, you know?\u201d\n \u201cA vampire?\u201d Paige shakes her head. \u201cNo. At least, not in the sense you\u2019re thinking. There\u2019s nothing supernatural or romantic about him. He\u2019s not afraid of crosses or garlic, or any of that bullshit.\u201d\n \u201cBut I saw his teeth.\u201d\n \u201cCeramic implants.\u201d\n They cut across a square in the shadow of a medieval church. Federico has the shotgun under his jacket, and it makes him walk stiffly. The rain\u2019s still falling, and there\u2019s music from the bars and coffeehouses; but few people are out on the street.\n \u201cThen what is he? Some sort of psycho?\u201d\n Paige slows for a second, and turns to him. \u201cHe\u2019s a guerrilla.\u201d\n \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n She starts walking again. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to.\u201d Her right hand\u2019s in her coat pocket, gripping the coil gun. She leads him out of the square, across a footbridge, and then they\u2019re into the Red Light District, with its pink neon shop fronts and narrow alleys. Her hotel\u2019s close to the Central Station. By the time they get there, they\u2019re both soaked, and stand dripping together in the elevator that takes them up to her floor.\n \u201cIn a thousand years\u2019 time, there\u2019s going to be a war,\u201d she says, watching the floor numbers count off. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a particularly nasty one, with atrocities on all sides.\u201d\n The lift doors open and she leads him along the carpeted corridor to her room. Inside, the room smells stale. It\u2019s been her base of operations for nearly a month, and she hasn\u2019t let the cleaner touch it in all that time. She hasn\u2019t even opened the curtains.\n \u201cThe vampires were bred to fight in the war,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were designed to operate behind enemy lines, terrorizing civilians, sowing fear and confusion.\u201d She shrugs off her coat and drops it over the back of a chair. \u201cThey\u2019re trained to go to ground, blend in as best they can, then start killing people. They\u2019re strong and fast, and optimized for night combat.\u201d\n Federico\u2019s standing in the doorway, shivering. She ushers him in and sits him on the bed. Gingerly, she takes the shotgun from his hands, and lays it on the sheet beside him; she then drapes a blanket around his shoulders.\n \u201cAfter the war, some of them escaped, and they\u2019ve been spreading backwards through time ever since.\u201d She crosses to the wardrobe, and pulls out a spirit bottle. It\u2019s a liter of vodka. She takes two teacups off the side and pours a large measure for him, a smaller one for herself. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to survive for long durations, without support. They can eat just about anything organic, and they\u2019re hard to kill. You can hurt them, but as long as their hearts are beating and their brains are intact, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019ll be able to repair themselves, given enough time.\u201d\n She puts the bottle aside and flexes the fingers of her left hand\u2014there\u2019s still an ache, deep in the bone.\n \u201cThat\u2019s important,\u201d she says. She kneels down in front of Federico, and takes his hands in hers. \u201cThe next time we see Josef, we\u2019ve got to kill him, before he kills us. And the only way to do that is to do as much damage as possible. Stop his heart, destroy his brain, and he\u2019s dead.\u201d\n She takes one of the teacups and presses it into Federico\u2019s hands.\n \u201cSorry,\u201d He says, accepting the drink, \u201cdid you say that this war is going to take place?\u201d\n \u201cA thousand years downstream, yes.\u201d\n \u201cSo it hasn\u2019t happened yet?\u201d\n \u201cNo.\u201d\n He frowns.\n \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n Paige reaches for her coat, and pulls out the coil gun. \u201cI\u2019m a fangbanger, a vampire killer.\u201d\n \u201cAnd you\u2019re from the future too?\u201d\n Paige stands.\n \u201cLook,\u201d she says. \u201cAll you need to know tonight is this: When you see Josef, shoot out his legs. That\u2019ll immobilize him, and give us time to kill him.\u201d She stops talking then. He can see Federico\u2019s had enough for one night. She slips a pill into his next drink and, within minutes, he\u2019s asleep, wrapped in the blanket, with the shotgun clasped protectively across his chest.\n Alone with her thoughts, Paige moves quietly. She turns out the bedside light and crosses to the window, pulling aside the heavy curtain. It\u2019s after twelve now, and the trams have stopped for the night. The streets are quiet. She feels she should congratulate Josef on his choice of hiding place. Amsterdam is an easy city in which to be a stranger; there are so many tourists, so many distractions, that it\u2019s a simple matter to lose yourself in the crowd. If she hadn\u2019t known what to look for, she might never have found him. But then, she\u2019s been a fangbanger for a long time, and she\u2019s learned to piece together seemingly unrelated deaths and unexplained crimes; to filter out the background noise of modern urban life in order to reveal the unmistakable M.O. of an active vampire. She leans her forehead against the window glass; heart pumping in her chest, knowing it won\u2019t take Josef long to track her down. She\u2019s been doing this job for enough years, waded through enough shit, to know how dangerous a wounded vampire can be.\n At 4am, the sky starts to gray in the east. Federico\u2019s still asleep, and Paige gives up her vigil. She tucks the coil gun into the back of her belt, pulls on a sweater to cover it, and wanders down to the hotel restaurant. When she gets there, she finds the place empty, although she can hear cooking sounds from the kitchen as the staff gear up for the breakfast rush. She helps herself to a cup of coffee from the pot, and a large handful of sugar sachets, and takes it all over to a table by the window, where she stirs the contents of the little packets into her coffee. There are sixteen altogether, and she uses them all. Then, leaving the sticky mess to cool, she rests her left arm on the table, and clenches and unclenches her fist. Everything seems in order. The tendons move as they should, and there\u2019s no trace of the break. It doesn\u2019t even ache now. Satisfied, she takes a sip of the lip-curlingly sweet coffee. It tastes disgusting, but she needs the sugar to refuel the tweaked macrophages and artificial fibroblasts that have allowed her to heal so quickly.\n Outside the window, it\u2019s still raining. She watched the drops slither on the glass. It makes her think of Josef in better times, before he had his fangs implanted. She remembers him as bright and swift and clever; a sociopath, yes, but still her best student. And there it is, her dirty little secret, the inconvenient truth she\u2019s been hiding from Federico: the reason she makes such a good vampire hunter is that during the war, before the vampires were deployed against the enemy, it was she who trained them. She was a military psychologist at the time, an expert in guerrilla warfare. While combat instructors taught the vampires how to kill, she showed them a range of nasty tricks culled from a thousand hard-fought insurgencies: from the Scythians of Central Asia to the soldiers of the Viet Cong, and beyond.\n She remembers her penultimate briefing in particular.\n \u201cThe vampire\u2019s a powerful archetype,\u201d she said to the cadets. \u201cIt\u2019s an expression of our darker side. It plays into our most primal anxieties, from the threat of rape to the fear of being eaten.\u201d It was a hot day, and the sun blazed through the classroom windows. She walked up and down in front of her students, hands clasped behind her back. At the rear of the room, the surgeons waited with their trolleys, ready to wheel the young men and women down to the operating theater, one-by-one, in order to implant their fangs and night-adapted eyes. \u201cTo complete your mission, you must be prepared to kill. You must become assassins\u2014anonymous killers in the night, spreading panic and mistrust.\u201d She stopped pacing and turned to Josef. He sat in the front row of the classroom, chin on fist, eyes blazing, and she knew it would be the last time she\u2019d see him before his transformation. \u201cIf you do your jobs correctly,\u201d she said, \u201ceach of you will be worth a hundred troops. You\u2019ll demoralize the enemy, eat out his fighting spirit from the inside. You\u2019ll have the soldiers worried about their families, the families suspicious of their neighbors. But in order to achieve this, you\u2019ll have to move like shadows, and show no mercy. Do anything that needs to be done, be ruthless, and be prepared to strike anywhere, at any time.\u201d\n She had taught them every psychological trick she knew, and shown them how to exploit the power of myth, how to generate fear and horror from darkness and blood. From their test scores, she\u2019d known they were intelligent. In fact, she\u2019d personally overseen the original selection process, picking only those recruits with the right balance of brains and insanity\u2014those clever enough to survive the mission, but also psychotic enough to become the monsters they\u2019d need to become in order to succeed.\n And then later, when the war went temporal, spilling into the surrounding decades, they came back and she briefed them again, only this time on the peculiarities of each of the time zones in which they were to operate, giving them the background they\u2019d need in order to blend into each zone\u2019s civilian population.\n Sometimes, she wonders if her history lessons inspired their eventual escape into this dim and distant past, far from even the outermost fringes of the conflict. One thing\u2019s for certain: since they mutinied, and back to these primitive times, she\u2019s had to travel all over the place in order to hunt them down. She\u2019s tracked individual vampires across half a dozen decades, in Los Angeles, Cairo, Warsaw, and London.\n Now she\u2019s here, in Amsterdam.\n And suddenly, there\u2019s Josef.\n He\u2019s standing in the shadow of a doorway on the other side of the street, watching her through the glass. He has his hands in the pockets of his black raincoat. Their eyes meet for a second and Paige can\u2019t breathe. Then he\u2019s gone, moving fast. Between parked cars, she catches a glimpse of him crossing the street, heading for the back of the hotel. With a curse, she pushes herself to her feet. Josef will know which room she\u2019s staying in\u2014a simple phone call will have furnished him with that information\u2014and now he\u2019s after Federico, hoping to kill the boy before tackling her.\n Paige bursts out into the foyer. Her room\u2019s on the fourth floor, so there\u2019s no time to take the stairs. However, luck\u2019s on her side: this early in the morning, the elevators all stand ready, their doors open. She slams into the nearest, and slaps the button for the fourth floor. Then, even as the doors are closing, she\u2019s pulling the coil gun from her belt and checking its magazine.\n Paige kicks her shoes off in the elevator and pads along the corridor in her socks. As she nears her room, she hears the door splinter: Josef\u2019s kicked his way in.\n \u201cDamn.\u201d\n She lifts the coil gun to her shoulder, and risks a peek around the frame. The room\u2019s dark. She can see a faint glow from the curtains. There are shadows all over the place: chairs, desks, and suitcases. Any one of them could be a crouched vampire.\n \u201cFuck.\u201d\n She ducks back into the corridor and takes a few quick breaths. If Josef\u2019s still in there, he\u2019ll have heard her already\u2014and there\u2019s a good possibility Federico\u2019s already dead. She flicks off the coil gun\u2019s safety catch. There\u2019s nothing beyond this room but window: the chances of civilian casualties are slight. Stepping back, she gives the trigger a squeeze. The gun whines. Holes appear in the door. Splinters flick out. The TV sparks. A chair blows apart.\n And there, in the maelstrom: a shadow moves.\n She tries to hose him down, but he\u2019s moving too fast. He hits the wall and pushes off; hits the floor and rolls; and then he\u2019s running on all fours, leaping at her throat before she can draw a bead.\n Paige rolls with the impact, still pressing the trigger. Scraps of material fly from Josef\u2019s overcoat. An overhead light explodes. Blood sprays. His ceramic teeth scrape her neck, grazing the skin. Then his momentum carries him over her head, and she uses a Judo throw to heave him into the corridor wall. He hits like an upside down starfish, arms and legs splayed, and then falls to the floor.\n They both lie panting.\n The carpet\u2019s soft. She rolls onto her side. Josef\u2019s lying on his front, looking sideways at her. His eyes are as blue as a gas flame. This is the first good look she\u2019s had at him since he left her class, and he looks older and harder than she remembers. His fangs are white and clean. Blood soaks into the carpet from a hole in his side.\n He doesn\u2019t move as she elbows herself up into a sitting position; but, as soon as she lifts the coil gun, he twists. His wrist flicks out, and a pair of shiny throwing stars bite Paige\u2019s arm. She cries out and the gun drops from her fingers. Instinctively, she reaches for it with her left hand, but Josef\u2019s anticipated the move: he pushes himself towards her, delivering a kick to her cheek that shatters the bone.\n Paige falls into the open doorway of her room. Black spots dapple her vision. She feels Josef grip her leg. His hands work their way up. He\u2019s climbing her, using his weight to keep her pinned down. She tries to fight back, but she\u2019s still dazed. He swats her hands away from his face.\n Then he\u2019s on her, his thighs clamped across her hips, his knees pinning her arms. He wraps his fingers in her hair, and yanks her head back, exposing her throat. His fangs are fully deployed. She sees them through the hair hanging down over his face, and cringes, expecting him to lunge for her throat.\n Instead, Josef clears his throat\n \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you,\u201d he says around his teeth. He pulls away, and his incisors slip back into their sheaths. He lets go of her hair and sits up, straddling her. Paige blinks up at him as he smoothes back his wet hair. \u201cI just want to talk.\u201d\n They end up slumped against opposite walls of the corridor. Josef\u2019s bleeding onto the carpet; Paige feels as if she\u2019s been hit by a fire truck. One side of her face throbs with pain, and the eye above her broken cheekbone won\u2019t focus properly.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got me all wrong,\u201d Josef says.\n She gives him a look.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a killer.\u201d\n \u201cNot anymore.\u201d He lets his shoulders relax, but keeps one hand pressed to the bullet hole in his side.\n \u201cBut Federico\u2014\u201d\n \u201cI haven\u2019t touched him.\u201d\n \u201cHe\u2019s still alive?\u201d\n Josef shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure. You sprayed a lot of bullets in there.\u201d\n And suddenly, they\u2019re falling back into their old pattern: teacher and student\u2014and she knows there\u2019s something he\u2019s not telling her.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Josef? Why am I still alive?\u201d\n He tips his head back, resting it against the wall.\n \u201cBecause things are different now,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m different.\u201d He reaches into his coat and pulls out a photograph, which he Frisbees across to her.\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you, you know? Not here, and not at the pub.\u201d He dips his chin and looks at her. \u201cJust acting in self-defense, trying to stop you from killing me.\u201d\n The picture shows Josef holding a child, maybe four or five years old.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n \u201cIt\u2019s my daughter.\u201d\n The girl has Josef\u2019s blue eyes and blonde hair. She\u2019s wearing a red dress.\n \u201cYour daughter?\u201d\n Josef closes his eyes.\n \u201cYes.\u201d\n Paige glances at the coil gun, lying on the carpet between them. She wonders if she can reach it before he can reach her.\n Josef says, \u201cI don\u2019t want any more trouble.\u201d\n Paige lifts a hand to her ruined cheek, and her lip curls.\n \u201cSo what? You think it matters what you want? So you\u2019ve gone and got yourself a family, and you think that wipes away all the shit you\u2019ve done, all the people you\u2019ve killed?\u201d\n She reaches for the gun. Josef howls in frustration, and lunges for her throat. His teeth rip into her esophagus, and she feels his jaw snap shut on her windpipe. His hair fills her face, and he\u2019s heavy on her chest. She can\u2019t breathe, and wonders how many others have died like this. How many others, because of her, and what she taught him?\n Josef pulls back, his face dripping with her blood and, as Paige gasps for breath, the wound bubbles.\n Josef snatches the photograph from her unresisting fingers. She tries to move her arms, but can\u2019t. Josef\u2019s speaking, but the fangs make it difficult, and she can\u2019t hear him over the roaring in her ears. Her eyes swivel around in panic, looking for help. The guests in the other rooms must be awake now, and cowering behind their peepholes. Some at least will have called the police.\n Then, as she twists her head, she catches movement in the room behind her. Federico stumbles into the light. The boy looks dazed and frightened; there are scratch marks on his face, but he has the shotgun in his hands.\n There\u2019s a flash, and Josef jerks. Part of his face disappears, bitten off by the blast. Another flash, and he topples from Paige like a puppet with its strings cut, knocking his head against the doorframe as he falls.\n Paige slaps a palm over the sucking wound in her neck, pinching the skin together, hoping she can heal before she suffocates.\n Federico bends over her. Wordless, she points to the coil gun, and he kicks it over.\n \u201cHelp me up,\u201d she croaks. As long as she keeps her hand covering the injury, her vocal chords still work.\n With Federico\u2019s hands under her shoulders, she struggles to her feet and coughs up a wad of blood. She feels unsteady, but each breath is easier than the last.\n Josef lies in a spreading patch of red-soaked carpet. One of his eyes is completely gone; that side of his face is a gory ruin; but the other seems miraculously untouched, and still beautiful. His hands twitch on the carpet like angry spiders.\n Paige plucks the slippery, homemade throwing stars from her forearm, and tosses them aside. She points the coil gun at Josef\u2019s heart. Dimly, she can hear sirens pulling up on the street outside.\n Josef\u2019s remaining eyelid flutters. She knows he\u2019s down, but he\u2019s obviously not out.\n She says, \u201cHow many people have you killed, Josef?\u201d Then, without waiting for an answer, she pulls the trigger. The gun whines and his chest blows apart. His heels scrape at the floor, as if trying to escape, and she raises the gun to his face.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says.\n She looks away as she fires, and she keeps the trigger depressed until the magazine clicks empty.\n When she looks back, Josef\u2019s head\u2019s gone, and there\u2019s a hole in the floor.\n The photograph of his daughter falls from his fingers.\n He\u2019s dead.\n She sticks the spent gun back in her belt. For some reason, her smashed cheek hurts more than her torn throat. She looks around to find Federico leaning on the doorframe.\n Paige hawks red phlegm onto the carpet. Then she leans down and takes hold of Josef\u2019s boot. Gritting her teeth, she drags his body back into her ruined hotel room. Moving slowly and painfully, she retrieves the vodka bottle from the dressing table, spins the lid off, and raises the bottle in a toast to her fallen student. She stands over him for a long moment. Then she takes a deep swallow, which makes her cough.\n \u201cGoodbye, Josef,\u201d she says. There\u2019s nothing else to say. There\u2019s no triumph here, no closure, nothing but bone-deep weariness. Solemnly, she pours the remaining contents of the bottle\u2014most of a liter of spirit\u2014over his chest and legs; then she pulls a complimentary matchbook from the desk, and strikes one.\n The wet clothes go up in a woof of blue flame. The fire spills onto the carpet, and the room fills with smoke.\n Paige opens the desk drawer and takes out another clip of ammo for the coil gun. Then she limps back to Federico.\n \u201cI have to go,\u201d she says. She has to move on to the next target, the next time zone.\n A fire alarm rings, and the sprinklers go off. The shotgun\u2019s on the floor at Federico\u2019s feet. He\u2019s holding the photograph of Josef\u2019s daughter. Water\u2019s running down his face, streaking his cheeks. His dreads are soaked.\n \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking monster,\u201d he says.\n Paige puts a hand to the torn flesh of her throat. She can feel the sides stitching themselves back together.\n \u201cI know,\u201d she says.\n And with that, she fades away.\n Originally published in Solaris Rising 3: The New Solaris Book of Science Fiction, edited by Ian Whates.\n Gareth L.

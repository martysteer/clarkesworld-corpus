She was trying to tie a rope to the pendant lamp, but, at her age, her eyes were too weak and her hands were no longer steady. She tried again and again but she couldn\u2019t loop the rope around the lamp.\n \u201cDo you need any assistance, Mrs. Griffin?\u201d LW31 set down Mrs. Griffin\u2019s meal tray, then walked to her side.\n Mrs. Griffin put her hands on her waist. She caught her breath then handed LW31 the rope. \u201cHelp me tie this rope to the pendant lamp.\u201d\n LW31\u2019s waist spun on its axis. The upper half of its body rose until it hit the ceiling. At the same time, he asked, \u201cWhat are you planning to do, Mrs. Griffin?\u201d\n \u201cI want to commit suicide.\u201d\n \u201cOh, in that case, I should tie both ends.\u201d LW31 nodded its head and said no more.\n It tied both ends of the rope to the lamp\u2019s curved pendant holder, tugged on it with both hands and judged the knots sufficiently secure. It turned its head to her.\n \u201cMrs. Griffin, the rope has been tied. You may commit suicide now.\u201d\n Panting with each step, Mrs. Griffin walked to just under the pendant lamp. LW31 brought her a chair. Trembling, she climbed the chair, feeling as though everything around her was rocking and swaying. Seeing this, LW31 stabilized her on the chair. Even though it\u2019d been in continuous service for sixty-five years now and many places on its body have been corroded with rust, its mechanical arms were still steady. One hand pushed down on the chair and the other supported her at the waist.\n Mrs. Griffin stood still. She stretched her head then then strapped the loop of rope around her neck.\n \u201cWait, wait, Mrs. Griffin. I would like to ask you.\u201d As it had always been, LW31\u2019s voice was the smooth surface of water in an ancient well. \u201cWhy did you pick hanging as the way to commit suicide?\u201d\n \u201cBecause it\u2019s effective . . . and, to anyone who finds me, a hanging corpse won\u2019t look so horrible.\u201d\n \u201cOh.\u201d\n LW31 raised its head. It was a black glass cover. Knives had cut facial features that formed a smiling face. But time had rendered them indistinct to the point where the smile seemed odd and harsh.\n It said, \u201cActually, Mrs. Griffin, you\u2019re as mistaken as those who had thought the Earth was the center of the universe. As a matter of fact, hanging is the most shameful way to commit suicide. Once you kick away the chair, your bodyweight will crack your trachea and your cervical vertebrae will shift. It\u2019s not like in the movies. You won\u2019t have a chance to struggle. You\u2019ll die in a split second. The problem is what happens after you die.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin firmly shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t try to convince me. I won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d\n \u201cAfter you die by hanging, your eyeballs will jut out like light bulbs, and your face will grow red from suffocation. As for the state of your body, if no one takes down your body within ten hours, the blood vessels in your face will break apart. Your head will be like a tomato, cracked to bursting. The most unseemly is your bodyweight will cause anal prolapse. Urine and feces will overflow . . . \u201d\n After two minutes of this, Mrs. Griffin climbed down from the chair. She sat on her bed, sobbing.\n \u201cWhy do you want to commit suicide?\u201d LW31 approached her, uncertain.\n \u201cIt came to me all of a sudden. Everyone who ever loved me is dead, leaving my life friendless and wretched. The idea to commit suicide tonight, it just grew stronger and stronger in my mind . . . no one\u2019s left who loves me. What\u2019s the point of living?\u201d Mrs. Griffin took a digital photo frame out of her pocket. Her aged fingers swipe across it and the transparent display transformed into pictures of people, one after another. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty-five years since my child died. Now, I can\u2019t bear even one more day of life.\u201d\n \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about those people who loved you, Mrs. Griffin?\u201d LW31 said. \u201cOnce you finish telling me about them, then I can help you commit suicide.\u201d\n The endless night painted the world outside the window black. Mrs. Griffin stopped crying. Her fingers pressed the photo\u2019s display, freezing it on a picture of a young husband and wife.\n She set down the phone in a daze. A burst of secret pain went through her. Maybe the kid in her belly kicked.\n He didn\u2019t come home until the small hours of the morning. It was a cold night and he exhaled icicles with each breath. His hands cold and his feet cold, he dug himself under the bed covers. He huddled up for a while before he could do anything else.\n She was still awake. \u201cBack so late again?\u201d\n Slowly, his body relaxed in the warmth. The chill faded and he grew sleepy. He answered, his words indistinct, \u201cYeah, overtime. Also, this week\u2019s pay, three hundred fifty points, I\u2019ve already deposited . . . \u201d\n He didn\u2019t finish his sentence. Instead, he shut his eyes and fell into a heavy sleep.\n She, however, couldn\u2019t sleep. This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d lied.\n For five months now, he\u2019d come home late every night, usually reeking of alcohol, only to fall asleep as soon as he got into the bedroom. She\u2019d ask him and he\u2019d just say \u201covertime.\u201d However, he was just an ordinary delivery trunk driver for an AI company. How was he always working overtime? She\u2019d just called his boss and found out the company didn\u2019t have overtime. Not to mention, five months ago, he\u2019d gotten a raise. Five hundred points, not three hundred fifty.\n The time and money he hid became her hidden worry. She was a proud woman, though, and never forced the truth from him. With every lie he cast, her heart cooled a little.\n He went to work as usual. She convalesced at home. Her fetus was already nine months old.\n Her home was cramped and dark. Often, she\u2019d bring out a chair to sit by the curb. The street was lined with plum trees. In the cold weather, each twig exploded with a row of red flowers. She sat under a tree, waiting for him to return home. Car after car, suspended on tracks in mid-air, scratched her gaze as they came and went.\n With so much free time, she counted on her memories to pass the days. She\u2019d first met him under this plum tree. Back then, she was still the daughter of a wealthy family. She was set for life. Designer clothes and expensive jewelry covered her from head to foot. She drove a luxury car. As she passed through, the red plum tree caught her attention. Or, rather, the man standing under the tree did. The red plum stood out against snow covered ground. He stood out like a bunch of plums against the snow of the boundless sky.\n She stopped her car then walked to his side. He smiled, warm laugh lines filling his face. He broke off a branch, giving it to her, saying, \u201cI was just wondering whether there was anything this winter more beautiful than these plum blossoms. But now that I\u2019ve seen you, I know my answer.\u201d\n Right then, she fell in love with him.\n Just like a classical romance, this love ran into her parents\u2019 violent disapproval. Her father had intended to arrange a business marriage for her. He flew into a rage, scolding her and beating her. He took away her purse and car, froze her card, then shut her inside their house. But it was no use. She was determined to marry him. Finally, with a wave of his hand and with an exhausted sigh, her father said one thing to her: Get out, and stay out.\n She spent a long time before she adapted to married life. He drove a truck, delivering robots everywhere. The work was hard and the pay was low. She\u2019d lived in luxury since she was a child, but for him, she threw herself into the oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar of a ordinary life. Once, when she was learning to cook, she cut her finger by accident. The spreading blood scared her into tears. He heard her cry and went into the kitchen. Holding her, he said over and over again, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in the kitchen. I will. Don\u2019t hurt yourself again.\u201d\n But, now, he\u2019d changed. He\u2019d learned to lie and hide money. Sometimes, his body carried the scent of alcohol and perfume. Everyone knew what this meant. She\u2019d given up her youth and riches, her fingers now smoked yellow, the corners of her eyes now wrinkled. In exchange, she received only the sight of his back receding into the distance.\n The more she thought about it, the more it weighed on her mind. At the foot of the plum tree, she collapsed into tears.\n After his shift, his boss called him in. \u201cYesterday, your wife called me. She said you always come home extremely late. Her stomach is so large now. It\u2019s not easy. Go home earlier and keep her company.\u201d\n He hurriedly nodded his head. \u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d\n After he left work, he didn\u2019t go home. Instead, he went the door of a nightclub in the middle of the city.\n Someone had been waiting too long for him. \u201cWhat took you so long? Quick, Boss Wang is already drunk. Drive him home.\u201d\n Obsequiously, he bowed again and again. He got into the flying car, started its engine, then flitted to his assigned location. This is what he did every night.\n He drove the nightclub\u2019s customers, delivering them home. He had to beg for a lot of favors before he got this second job. Just one delivery paid at least ten points. Most of those bosses had drunk too much and stank of alcohol. Sometimes, in the embrace of a woman whose clothes were drenched with the spray of perfume, they didn\u2019t go home. Their destination was a guest house. He didn\u2019t mind. He just wanted to be paid.\n He didn\u2019t tell her about this second job. He wanted the money to be a pleasant surprise.\n Five months ago, as he was signing for his freight, his boss told him, \u201cThis is LW\u2019s latest domestic robot. It can do all sorts of household chores.\u201d\n He laughed. \u201cWhat about taking care of a baby?\u201d\n The boss snorted. \u201cNot just babies. This robot has a long term of service. It can take care of someone from birth all the way until death.\u201d\n This sentence moved his heart.\n She was clumsy and not very good at household chores, to say nothing of raising a child. If she had a robot to help her, he wouldn\u2019t spend every work day worrying about her. After that, he asked how much it cost. Twenty thousand Alliance points. This was not a small number.\n So, for these few months, he was always busy outside the house. According to his calculations, in five months, he\u2019d saved three thousand points from his wages. Add to that the hundred extra points he earned every night and he\u2019d now saved eighteen thousand points. Their child would be born soon. He needed to earn money more quickly.\n Tonight, he took a couple, man and a woman, to a hotel. On the road, she tittered as the man\u2019s hands never stopped caressing her. He paid no attention to them, focused on his driving. The hotel wasn\u2019t far. Its neon lights flickered below them.\n Some people. The woman was a little shy, after all. She pushed aside the man\u2019s hand when he reached for her skirt.\n The man was not happy. He roared, \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of?\u201d\n Despite those words, the man raised his head and looked around. His gaze fell upon the photo on the car window.\n It was of a couple, a man and a woman. Their happiness together shone on their faces. She rested her head on his shoulder. He looked at her with a mild expression. In the background was a cluster of plum blossoms in full bloom among the ice and snow.\n The man, staring blankly, asked: \u201cThis photo . . . \u201d\n Like the man, he raised head and looked at the photo. With an irrepressible joy, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s me and my wife. She\u2019s beautiful, yeah? I\u2019m a lucky man. She\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s a girl. She\u2019ll grow up to be just as beautiful.\u201d\n \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you at home with her?\u201d\n \u201cI have to make money so that I can buy her a present: a robot. So she won\u2019t have to work every day.\u201d\n The man stayed silent.\n The woman, who had just resisted the man\u2019s advances, noticed the man wasn\u2019t touching her any more. Confused, she pulled the man\u2019s hands to her. The man pulled them back, then lit a cigarette. The smoke drifted around the car\u2019s small and narrow cabin.\n When he finished smoking, he said slowly, \u201cDon\u2019t go to the hotel. Take me home.\u201d\n The woman asked, \u201cTo your home? I\u2019m not that kind of\u2014\u201d\n \u201cYou can go right now.\u201d\n The man took out his card. He tapped a few numbers on it, put the woman\u2019s finger on its screen, then transferred over that many points.\n The woman grumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s enough money, but I have professional ethics. Halfway though, I can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d\n \u201cGo.\u201d\n The women left. He continued to drive on to the man\u2019s house.\n A plain woman came out. She brought the man an overcoat.\n \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had a meeting tonight?\u201d\n \u201cI canceled it.\u201d The man ran his hands through her hair. \u201cNo meeting is more important than you.\u201d\n He watched this play out. His heart roiled with an indescribable feeling. He laughed, started the engine, then slowly left the rich side of town. Suddenly, he thought of her and didn\u2019t want to earn any more money tonight. He wanted to turn in early and spend time with her. Whenever she felt cold\u2014and their house was always cold\u2014she\u2019d rub her hands, wrinkle her nose. The way she behaved was adorable. The way she behaved would worry him for the whole of his life.\n Tonight, he\u2019d use his wallet to stop her hands. He\u2019d rub them slowly until they grew warm from the circulating blood. He laughed at the thought.\n His mind still preoccupied, he didn\u2019t pay attention in both directions. An out-of-control flying car fell off its suspended track. It hit him from the right. The two flying cars rolled over each other then fell out of the sky. They exploded, blooming into resplendent, beautiful flowers.\n She overslept. She waited for him, but he never came home. She got out of bed, went out to the street then stood under the plum tree. If he came back, he\u2019d have to pass through here. When he came back, he\u2019d see her under the plum tree, like when they\u2019d first met, a face set off against plum blossoms.\n The night was as cold as water and she wrapped her clothes tight around her. She\u2019d decided to forgive him. It didn\u2019t matter what he\u2019d done. She\u2019d decided to forgive it all. He was her only worry in the world. Her plan now set, she began to laugh. When he came back, he\u2019d definitely grasp her hands in his and rub them, letting circulating blood make them warm.\n This is how she waited for him, staring at the end of the street, hoping he\u2019d appear from somewhere. Overhead, a cluster of plum blossoms opened in resplendent beauty.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry . . . I\u2019m genuinely sorry.\u201d LW31 lowered his head in apology.\n Mrs. Griffin shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault . . . My mom was an ill-fated person. Not long after she gave birth to me, she died. But she was also a fortunate person. After his death, she still used the money to buy you. It shows that she never blamed anyone.\u201d\n LW31 paused, then put its hand on Mrs. Griffin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIn that case, I can now help you carry out some other way of dying. How would you like to die?\u201d\n \u201cSleeping pills? That way, I won\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d\n \u201cOK.\u201d LW31 answered. \u201cExcept that, right now, we have two problems.\u201d\n \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n \u201cOne, within forty-eight hours of overdosing on sleeping pills, not only will you not be able to sleep, but symptoms like gastrospasm, abdominal pain, and foaming at the mouth will emerge. This is because every organ in your body will perform their post-poison stress function. Many people who attempt suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills, because they can\u2019t stand the pain any longer, call for help . . . Mrs. Griffin, I don\u2019t think you will want to endure that sort of pain.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin closed her eyes. Most of a day passed, it seemed, then her lips quivered. \u201cI\u2019d just like to commit suicide. I just want not to look like a disgrace after I\u2019m dead. Even if I foam at the mouth, you will take care of my corpse for me, right?\u201d\n \u201cOf course. I exist to serve you.\u201d\n \u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d Mrs. Griffin nodded. \u201cAs for the pain . . . Throughout my entire life, I\u2019ve endured too much pain. I\u2019ve long gone numb. Open the drawer and check. How many sleeping pills are left?\u201d\n \u201cMrs. Griffin, this happens to be the second problem. We don\u2019t have enough sleeping pills.\u201d LW31 opened the drawer and took out the drugs. \u201cA total of seventeen pills. This is a prescription drug. A pharmacy will sell twenty pills at most. Given your build, to cause death you may need eighty-six pills.\u201d\n \u201cCan\u2019t you go out and buy them for me?\u201d\n \u201cMrs. Griffin, maybe you forgot. The great migration has already begun. Practically everyone has already gone. There are no more pharmacies.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin sighed. The lamp lit her face. She seemed a little sallow. The years had left gullies on her face.\n LW31 said politely, \u201cMrs. Griffin, it would be better if you tell me more. Besides your parents, there were other people who loved you, right?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Griffin swiped the photo again. This time who appeared was a lanky young man. Mrs. Griffin glanced at him. Thick tears drifted from her eyes. One night from many years ago floated up to the present.\n Late night.\n Silence.\n Peter and Jason stood silent at the gate at start of the street.\n A street like this one,\n there shouldn\u2019t be anyone standing there.\n A street like this one,\n there shouldn\u2019t have been two men in designer suits standing there at night.\n The start of the street was broken.\n The middle of the street was cold.\n The end of the street was dark.\n This was the most run down street in the city. Normally, few people walked it. It was a crime-ridden street. In dark places, countless eyes opened, stomachs rumbled, waiting for prey to enter.\n Afterwards, the prey were swallowed and digested. Nothing left of them to be spit back out.\n But Peter and Jason stood at the head of the street, relaxed, as though they belonged there. As though this was their home.\n Peter was tall and thin. Standing there, motionless, he seemed like a sharp pencil.\n Jason was short and fat, just like a wax gourd that had rolled all over the ground.\n Jason was smoking. With a deep drag, the flame fled from the head of the cigarette to the end. The entire cigarette was burnt up.\n Peter asked, \u201cNow?\u201d\n Jason blew a puff of thick smoke. \u201cNow.\u201d\n The two men started down the long, dark street.\n The wind blew by. It whimpered like tearful ghosts.\n The people who lived on the street, they weren\u2019t law-abiding folk.\n They were of all sorts. The beggar\u2019s neighbor was a thief. Above the thief lived a prostitute. Across from the prostitute\u2019s balcony was a reliably blundering cheat.\n But they all had one thing common.\n They were poor.\n So poor that they could only live on this old, dilapidated street like snails in their shells.\n To be poor is to suffer. It\u2019s the kind of suffering that freezes the heart stone cold.\n So, whenever someone walked down this street, they usually entered the gaze of the beggar, the thief, the prostitute, and the cheat.\n They\u2019d swindled old men out of their clothes. They\u2019d taken candy from babies.\n They never let even a single cent slip past them.\n But, now, they didn\u2019t dare even plan. They shut their windows. They lay on their beds, grinding their teeth until they sucked blood, not daring to make a sound.\n Because Peter and Jason were walking down the street.\n They walked neither quickly nor slowly. Their every step clicked on the pavement, solid and steady.\n Peter walked six hundred fifty-nine steps altogether. Jason one thousand three hundred fifteen.\n They stopped in front of a room at the tail of the street.\n The room was dark. Its light was out.\n But Jason heard breathing.\n Panting like a fawn running from a hunter\u2019s gun.\n Jason lifted his head and laughed grimly.\n They haven\u2019t found the wrong place.\n They beat the door three times like drum.\n No one answered.\n Jason continued to pound the door.\n Dull and dreary, the dense dark of the night flustered them.\n \u201cWho is it?\u201d At last, a sound from inside. It was a female voice, as clear as a bell, but trembling.\n Jason said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\n Peter said, \u201cAnd me.\u201d\n The woman inside the room said, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n Peter and Jason said, \u201cWe are detectives from Public Safety Bureau of the Alliance of City-States.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d\n Peter said, \u201cBut we\u2019re already here.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cCan\u2019t you just go back?\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cThe last person who wanted us to go back is now sleeping in prison.\u201d\n The woman in the room sighed.\n She couldn\u2019t hide from disaster.\n The woman opened the door.\n When she opened the door, she saw short and fat Jason and she saw tall and thin Peter.\n And Peter looked at the woman.\n He couldn\u2019t help but gape at her. She was an extremely beautiful woman.\n There were many standards for judging a woman\u2019s beauty. Some preferred the face, particularly the nose and mouth. Some preferred the figure, obsessing over the breasts, waist, ass, and legs. But no matter who the judges were, once they looked at this woman, they couldn\u2019t deny her beauty.\n Because, regardless of face or figure, she was completely flawless.\n Pretty brows, seductive eyes, a jade nose, a cherry mouth.\n Ample breasts, tiny waist, a round ass, long and slender legs.\n Combined to perfection.\n Jason, instead, looked at the room behind the woman.\n The room was small. The walls were old, but clean. It made one unspeakably comfortable just to look at it. The room didn\u2019t have much furniture, but the owner had clearly chosen every piece with care. Every piece was placed exactly where it ought to be.\n The woman said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come to my home in the middle of the night. What do you want?\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know what we want?\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cHow would I, a weak woman, know what you want?\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cBut you know about the book, right?\u201d\n The woman shivered, but quickly composed herself. \u201cWhat book?\u201d\n Jason took everything in his gaze. Calmly, he reached inside his jacket and pulled out his tablet. Its screen changed as he swiped it.\n A front cover of a book appeared on the screen.\n The front cover was bronze colored, with the title at the top.\n The title was only five words. Five ordinary words.\n But the woman looked as though she\u2019d seen a ghost. Her face changed expression.\n The Domestic Robot Administration Amendment\n Peter, who\u2019d been silent so far, started to speak.\n His words were like his body, lean and taut. \u201cWe have information. You\u2019re hiding an LW model robot.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cAnd according to the amendment, all the robots must be reclaimed.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cOf course you know. Your face betrays you.\u201d\n The woman said nothing.\n Peter looked at her with care. His voice grew gentle. \u201cA month ago, a PRW model domestic robot, while its owner was asleep, severed his throat. The deceased was an Alliance assemblyman. The Alliance has already passed a law. All robots are to be reclaimed.\u201d\n The woman shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no robot here.\u201d\n Jason laughed coldly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t get the last word here.\u201d\n With that, Jason pushed the woman away, then entered the room.\n The woman crashed into the wall.\n She looked to Peter for help, but Peter lowered his head, his expression difficult to read.\n Jason narrowed his gaze. He looked all around the room. No robot.\n Peter said, \u201cThere\u2019s no robot. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\n Jason raised his hand. His gaze fell on the bed, the snow white sheets, the neatly folded blanket. The foot posts were made of a metal alloy. They were coated with dust.\n This woman with the meticulously arranged room, how could she put up with the dust on the foot posts?\n Jason laughed. His laughter was joyous.\n He pointed at the bed. \u201cIs something hiding under the bed?\u201d\n The woman\u2019s face instantly went pale.\n Jason lit another cigarette. \u201cNow you have two options.\u201d\n The woman quickly nodded her head.\n Jason said, \u201cOption one, I take the robot back. It\u2019ll be melted down and, for the crime of hiding it, you\u2019ll be put in prison.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cPlease, I beg you. Don\u2019t take away LW31. It\u2019s the only thing my parents left me.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cThen you have option two. Give me five thousand points and I\u2019ve seen nothing.\u201d\n The woman furrowed her brow. \u201cBut I don\u2019t have that much money. Take everything else in my home. Just leave me LW31.\u201d\n The corners of Jason\u2019s mouth curled into a slight smile. His gaze slid from the woman\u2019s face down, \u201cEven if I took everything in your house, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201d\n Jason\u2019s gaze felt like a serpent. Clammy and cool, it slithered over her skin.\n The woman\u2019s chest tightened.\n Calmly, Jason stared at the woman. He enjoyed the fear that spread across the woman\u2019s face. He was pleased, and a certain part of his body began to respond.\n A long time had passed before he spoke. \u201cI want you for ten nights.\u201d\n The woman violently shook her head.\n Jason made an apologetic sigh. \u201cThen say goodbye to your robot.\u201d\n Before he\u2019d even finished speaking, the woman raised her hand to hit him.\n She only needed one chance. This one chance was enough to subdue him.\n She assembled machines at the factory. Her work every day was to reach her hand in to shove motherboards into the machines.\n So, she\u2019d already practiced this move for four years, five months and twenty-eight days. She was absolutely certain that no one in this room could stop her.\n But, this once, she was wrong.\n Astonishment gradually solidified on her face. One hand, one fat, white, and strong hand clutched her throat.\n The hand belonged to Jason.\n No one had ever thought that someone short and fat could reach his hand out so quickly.\n The woman implored him. \u201cLW31 isn\u2019t dangerous. It\u2019s just responsible for taking care of me. For a long time now. I can\u2019t lose it. I beg you.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a chance to beg, but it\u2019ll be when we\u2019re both naked. People who try to hit me don\u2019t come to a good end. You\u2019ll quickly know how living can be worse than dying.\u201d\n He wasn\u2019t lying. Jason never lied. If you met Jason one day and he told you he wanted to kill you, there was only thing you should do: go home and make out your will.\n You couldn\u2019t resist and there was no escape because he was Jason.\n The woman\u2019s face filled with despair. This time, her eyes suddenly widened. She saw something she absolutely wasn\u2019t supposed to see.\n A gun pressed against the back of Jason\u2019s head.\n Peter said, \u201cLet her go.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cYou want to betray me because of her?\u201d\n Peter, his face expressionless, said, \u201cI can\u2019t take it any more. Searching for robots as an excuse, you\u2019ve extorted nearly two hundred thousand Alliance points, raped seven women, hounded nineteen residents of the city to death.\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re a good guy?\u201d\n Peter said, \u201cI\u2019m not, but now I want to be.\u201d\n Jason sneered. \u201cI bet you can\u2019t kill me.\u201d\n Peter laughed. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n Jason said, \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d\n Peter pulled the trigger.\n Blood splashed.\n The man fell.\n The woman looked at Peter. Astonished, she sized him up. Tears fell from her eyes. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n Peter shrugged. \u201cPeter upheld justice for you. He begs you not to cry. If the world is unjust, get drunk, wave a sword, then cut off heads.\u201d\n The woman nodded. \u201cBut you killed him and he died in my home. Maybe I should get ready to flee.\u201d\n Peter said, \u201cBut, one person fleeing will be very lonely.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cWhat do you suggest then?\u201d\n Peter studied the woman.\n For a long time, they looked at each other and laughed. Peter extended his hand. \u201cHello, my name is Peter, Peter Griffin.\u201d\n The woman said, \u201cI\u2019m Xue Yi.\u201d\n Peter took a step forward, then held the woman.\n The woman felt his embrace.\n He was very tall.\n Very thin.\n His face was cool.\n His arms were stiff.\n But his chest was warm.\n \u201cThat night, we spent a lot of time digging a hole and buried you in it. Afterward, he took me and we fled here, there, and everywhere until the Alliance collapsed. We didn\u2019t return until the orders for our arrest were canceled.\u201d\n LW31 looked at her serenely. After a while, Mrs. Griffin let out an inaudible sigh.\n She said lightly, \u201cBut the good times didn\u2019t last. Not long after we settled down, he grew ill and died. In the years when we were on the run, he always gave the good things to our daughter and me. All the injuries and illnesses accumulated in his body . . . \u201d\n \u201cI remember him a little. He was laconic, capable, and he loved you very much.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin exposed her wrists. She tossed the grief from her mind. \u201cI want to open a blood vessel. Come and help me.\u201d\n LW31 nodded its head, then took a thin knife from a drawer. It gleamed as though it were lacquered with a layer of light.\n Mrs. Griffin held out her wrists. The knife edge immediately pressed down on an old, wrinkled, pulsing vessel. A chill started at her skin then oozed into the blood vessel. She began to shiver.\n \u201cI\u2019m going to start cutting. Are you ready?\u201d LW31 asked.\n \u201cI\u2019m ready. Just get on it.\u201d Mrs. Griffin snapped. She closed her eyes then immediately opened them again. Shivering, she asked, \u201cWhat happens after you open a blood vessel?\u201d\n \u201cThat depends on which one I cut. If it\u2019s a vein, then your blood will flow out right away, but not like a river in volume. That\u2019s because your platelets will have already congealed at the wound. If it\u2019s an artery, then you\u2019ll die quickly. However, in that scenario, blood will spurt like a fountain. It may be hard to keep this within the limits of propriety. Blood will drench your body. I fear that you\u2019ll look horribly mutilated.\u201d LW31 spoke at a steady pace. \u201cShould I start cutting now?\u201d\n \u201cIn that case, is there some other way?\u201d\n \u201cYes, there\u2019s a way that is highly appropriate for you. However, before I tell you, you have to tell me again about someone who loved you.\u201d\n The photo frame\u2019s screen flickered. Quickly, a smiling girl, bright and beautiful, pulling a suitcase behind her appeared. The screen also displayed three short arcs. That indicated that this photo also had sound. Mrs. Griffin\u2019s trembling hand touched the screen. Immediately, a graceful but ordinary voice surrounded the room.\n In the winter of 2335, dragging my suitcase, I returned to the small town I left seven years ago.\n The airport was deserted. Wind from a distant place blew here and my hair fluttered in that wind. I grew dizzy at the sight of a sky that was filled with clouds, a vast expanse of exquisite grace sweeping past the town. I began to understand that when a woman was looking at the sky, she wasn\u2019t looking for anything. She was just being still.\n The stillness oozed into my veins, like ice-cold lips kissing my bones.\n There weren\u2019t many taxis at midnight. Once in a while, a few passed by on the suspended tracks, their headlights scratching a line in the dark.\n I stood by the side of the street, watching flowing light drag shadow behind it. A taxi stopped in front of me. A dark window rolled down revealing the driver. He was a good-looking man. When he smiled, his teeth were white. The corners of his mouth tilted gently. The expression in his eyes was as clean and flowing as water.\n \u201cWhere to?\u201d he asked.\n I stepped in, then told him my destination.\n Once we got on the road, we didn\u2019t speak.\n I plastered my face to the car window. Colors faded as I rode. I saw the town through the gray forms that emerged. Nothing had changed in seven years. This small town, old and broken, still made people\u2019s hearts bleak and desolate.\n \u201cEveryone is emigrating now. Very few returned.\u201d The driver was the first to speak.\n I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m also planning to leave. I applied for the Pegasus star system, the planet called KG6. My application\u2019s already approved.\u201d\n \u201cThen what are you returning here for?\u201d\n \u201cTo say goodbye.\u201d\n The driver didn\u2019t say any more.\n The taxi stopped in the north end, at a house I knew intimately. I got out. The driver, still stopped by the side of the road, wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leave. I think he must have wanted to tell me something. At last, though, he just started the engine. The taxi slowly glided into the night.\n I knocked on the door. The dull thuds sounded like the beating of a lonely heart.\n The door opened with a creak. The robot\u2019s face revealed itself. Facial features had been carved on its black face guard. The childish scratches formed a weird smile.\n The robot came out and took my suitcase. \u201cMiss, you\u2019ve returned.\u201d\n I looked inside. The house was a black cavity. \u201cIs she here?\u201d\n \u201cYes, she\u2019s home. She\u2019s been waiting for you for a long time. Why don\u2019t we go in?\u201d\n I hesitated. I stood at the door. Below my feet, it was as if a deep trench had split open. A great and frozen wind blew down that vast gap. I had no way to cross it. I simply sat down. The woman inside the house, who was also sitting, opened her eyes, as though she was looking back at me.\n She was my mother. Or, rather, she was once my mother.\n The first seventeen years of my life, I spent at her side. In my memory, this little house will always be cold and damp, like the years I can\u2019t bear. The place always carried the faint smell of rot and the young me hated it. After I escaped, though, not a night went by that I didn\u2019t secretly long for this house.\n I was born in the final age of Earth\u2019s exhaustion. No one felt secure. When I was small, I saw too many pallid faces grow alarmed and bewildered, but I didn\u2019t know why. Until I was five, I roamed the world with my parents. Or rather, we were fugitives.\n Then the once colossal Alliance crumbled. We settled down with lots of robots to help with the housework. But not long after, my father, lying in bed, swallowed his last breath. I remember his eyes, withered and cloudy, staring forever at her and me. Deep grief was buried in those eyes.\n After my father died, she became frail and stubborn. She wouldn\u2019t let me out of the house. She wouldn\u2019t let me have any contact with boys. If I defied her, she didn\u2019t hit me or yell at me. She just kept staring at me, her dark eyes shining like a wolf\u2019s.\n So I stayed by her side. Time flowed like water. It washed over me until I was clear and slender. However, it wore her down until her face grew ashen and wrinkled. Did time retaliate against her on my behalf? I\u2019ve never dared to imagine.\n I let go of a silent breath. A fierce wind screamed under the cover of night. The town let out a loud and lonely cry. Yes, the town was also lonely. One after another, people emigrated. The center of town was deserted, like a great beast that has lost its heart, lamenting without end.\n \u201cMiss, let\u2019s go in.\u201d The robot had waited a long time before finally speaking. Its voice was as flat as ever. This time, though, I seemed to hear an imploring tone in its voice.\n But I shook my head. If she didn\u2019t open her mouth, I wouldn\u2019t go in. She and I were two sheafs of wheat in a wheat field, leaning against each other, but always pushing against each other too. We could never hug.\n When I was seventeen, I decided to leave.\n That summer, I had worked everywhere in town. I carefully saved every cent. After that muggy summer, I already had enough money for a bus ticket. As far as I was concerned, all I needed was a bus ticket and I could lead my own vagrant life.\n So, that September, I told her, \u201cMa, I\u2019m going to buy a book.\u201d\n \u201cHm,\u201d she said in the dark.\n I turned to the door, and just like that, I left home. The moment I bought my bus ticket, tears filled my face. Soundlessly, I sobbed.\n And she waited for me to return. It took exactly seven years.\n In those seven years, I traveled to many places. I saw warm sunshine and was drenched in dark rain. I never stopped moving. Until I met him.\n It was on a main street in the south. He stood on a platform simultaneously passing out leaflets to passersby and, in a loud voice, extolling the virtues of the interstellar immigration policy. The instant he gave me a leaflet, I saw his beautiful eyes. Furrows wrinkled his brow. His gaze, clear like spring water, flowed past the seething sunlight and crowd, surmounted the air, then flowed into mine.\n And just like that, I was lost.\n The man always liked to hold my face in his large palms, nuzzle my forehead with his nose then tease me like a small animal. I never refused him. Later, when he wanted to take me away from Earth, I still didn\u2019t refuse him.\n He said, \u201cWe\u2019ll settle down in the Pegasus star system. There\u2019s already a terraformed planet. The atmosphere is as fresh as your breath. Six satellites orbit the planet. When you walk outside at night, six shadows spread out beneath your feet.\u201d\n I said, \u201cFine.\u201d\n My only request was to return to see her, to say goodbye.\n But, now, I hesitated at the door. It was a chilly night but I didn\u2019t dare go in.\n The person in the room and I exchanged gazes. After I don\u2019t know how long, I stood. \u201cLW31, give me my suitcase. I want to leave.\u201d\n \u201cMiss, you really don\u2019t want to visit her?\u201d The robot said, hurriedly. \u201cShe\u2019s missed you so much these past few years.\u201d\n I nodded. I\u2019d also missed her. Instead of sending a message, if I had a chance, I\u2019d come back to visit again.\n The robot stayed silent. Dew condensed on it, like tears weeping down its outer shell.\n She still hadn\u2019t come out and I decided I wouldn\u2019t wait any longer. I took my suitcase, turned around, then left. Clouds floated across the sky. A strong wind howled past.\n I knew she was in the back looking at me, but I never turned around.\n \u201cI know what happened next.\u201d LW31 said. \u201cThe spaceship she rode on was hit by a meteorite. The ship\u2019s cabin was damaged. All the crew and passengers suffocated to death.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin didn\u2019t say anything. A long while later, two thick tears fell down her face. They hit the photo frame. The display slowly faded to black.\n \u201cSo, those who loved me, they\u2019re all gone.\u201d Mrs. Griffin put the photo frame back into her pocket. \u201cI no longer have any meaning to my life. Tell me the way to kill myself. Let me die, please?\u201d\n \u201cAs you wish. The most suitable method is . . . electrocution.\u201d\n \u201cWon\u2019t that hurt?\u201d\n \u201cElectrocution is the most beautiful way to commit suicide. It best preserves the original appearance of the corpse. In fact, if it\u2019s done correctly, it doesn\u2019t even leave any burn marks. In the moment of electrocution, you\u2019ll feel a sharp pain then you\u2019ll stop breathing and your heart will stop beating. The process is very quick. Practically no pain at all.\u201d LW31 said earnestly. \u201cBut what you need to make sure of is this: the electric current must pass through the heart in order to cause death. No other way will do. But I can help you with this bit. I will use rubber tape to attach copper wire to your solar plexus. I guarantee the electrical current will pass through your heart. Moreover, I will use cotton balls moistened with salt water to lower your resistance. Mrs. Griffin, would you like to do this now?\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin nodded her head.\n \u201cVery well. I exist to serve you.\u201d LW31 turned to look for copper wire, rubber tape, and cotton balls, but when he reached the door, he stopped. \u201cMrs. Griffin, before you are electrocuted, I want to give you a warning. You\u2019re wrong about a few things.\u201d\n \u201cWhat things?\u201d\n \u201cYou said everyone who ever loved you is dead, leaving your life friendless and wretched.\u201d LW31\u2019s back faced Mrs. Griffin. Its back was corroded by rust. Its voice was slow. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. There\u2019s still one person, from start to finish, who has always loved you.\u201d\n \u201cWho?\u201d\n LW31 turned around. In the light, the smile scratched on its black face guard seemed to move. It looked at Mrs. Griffin, its carved gaze infinitely soft. The electric transmission in its body buzzed.\n After a long time, it said, \u201cMe.\u201d\n Mrs. Griffin stared dumbfounded.\n Events of her past fell thick like snowflakes. Gradually and clearly, she realized it was right. Throughout her long life, LW31 indeed had stuck with her from start to finish. When she was little, her mother was always ill. She couldn\u2019t do any housework. LW31 took care of Mrs. Griffin in every possible way. It allowed her to grow up without any worries or cares.\n Once when she was mischievous, she thought its black face guard was too forbidding, so she carved a smile on it. It didn\u2019t get angry. It was peaceful and docile. After she grew up, LW31 always cleaned the house until it was spotless, cooked the meals, then stood quietly in the house, waiting for Mrs. Griffin to come home from work. After her daughter was born, it became even busier. It practically never had any free time. Once Mrs. Griffin grew old, it still took care of everything at home. It accompanied Mrs. Griffin sunbathing, told her jokes downloaded from the internet.\n It could take care of a person all her life and, from start to finish, show every possible consideration without even a single complaint. If that wasn\u2019t love, then what was?\n Mrs. Griffin choked with sobs. She walked up to then hugged LW31. Her hand touched LW31\u2019s back. There, LW31\u2019s outer casing was even rougher than Mrs. Griffin\u2019s skin.\n \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve always taken you for granted.\u201d\n \u201cNever mind, Mrs. Griffin.\u201d LW31 still had that smiling expression. Its voice was tranquil like before. \u201cMrs. Griffin, your dinner is already cold. Would you like me to reheat it?\u201d\n \u201cYes.\u201d Mrs. Griffin wiped away her tears, nodding her head.\n Translated and published in partnership with Storycom.\n John Chu is a microprocessor architect by day, a writer, translator, and podcast narrator by night.
